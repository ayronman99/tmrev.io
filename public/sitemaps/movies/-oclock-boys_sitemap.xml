        >Pug, a wisecracking 13 year old living on a dangerous Westside block,
        has one goal in mind: to join The Twelve O'Clock Boys; the notorious
        urban dirt-bike gang of Baltimore. Converging from all parts of the
        inner city, they invade the streets and clash with police, who are
        forbidden to chase the bikes for fear of endangering the public. When
        Pug's older brother dies suddenly, he looks to the pack for mentorship,
        spurred by their dangerous lifestyle. Pug's story is coupled with
        unprecedented, action-packed coverage of the riders in their element.
        The film presents the pivotal years of change in a boy's life growing up
        in one of the most dangerous and economically depressed cities in the
        US.</image:caption
