        >One day, a woman named Chiyome Hesogakure with a child named Chinzō
        visits the Nohara family and claims that she is the real mother of
        Shinnosuke and takes him away to a Ninja Village. In the Ninja Village,
        the Hesogakure family has been protecting "the earth's navel" by
        blocking it with a pure gold stopper using the "Mononoke technique" that
        has been passed down from generation. If it comes off, the earth will
        wither, the rotation will stop, and the "tomorrow" of the world will be
        lost! It is up to Shinnosuke to reveal the mystery of his birth and
        protect the future of the earth and the "tomorrow" of his
        family.</image:caption
