        >Back in the 80s, five friends cause raucous in their schooldays. Twenty
        years on and they've got jobs they don't want and wives who don't want
        them. The leader of the gang, Frankie, is now dying in Yorkshire. The
        others find out and they get together for one last sad, mad, bad road
        trip to Dewsbury, before it's all too late. Mix in a dollop of The
        Inbetweeners' intellectual wit, add a pinch of bromancing from The
        World's End, and then stir in a few ladles of The Hangover's vomit and
        you've got Destination: Dewsbury, destined to be one of 2018's funniest
        releases.</image:caption
