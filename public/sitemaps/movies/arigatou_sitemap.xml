        >In the early morning of January 17, 1995, the Great Hanshin-Awaji
        Earthquake struck, and Tadao Furuichi (Hidekazu Akai), who was running a
        camera store in Kobe City, lost his friends, his house, and his
        property. Tadao is busy volunteering for the reconstruction of the town,
        and one day he comes across his own golf bag that survived the
        earthquake. Feeling a miracle, Tadao decides to challenge the
        professional golf test before he turns 60.</image:caption
