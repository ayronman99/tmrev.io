        >This fascinating Video is a compilation of various cartoons that use
        humor to tout the dangers of Communism and the benefits of capitalism.
        It contains Cold War era cartoons defending the profit motive against
        anti-capitalist critics and telling American workers that they are the
        luckiest people in the world!The main message of all of the films is how
        you should be proud to be an American. Shot in the 1940s workers are
        told that increased productivity would bring about greater purchasing
        power during inflationary times. In the final clip there is an
        interesting corporate Cold War- era cartoon linking Bill Of rights to
        free-enterprise ideology.</image:caption
