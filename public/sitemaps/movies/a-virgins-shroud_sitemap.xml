        >Rasty and her friends, Smitha, Debby, Marchel, Harry, and Dhana, try to
        make a video clip of her at a train station. While editing the video,
        they see a strange apparition in the footage. When they go back to the
        station to make a documentary, they start being haunted. They are
        advised to tear the shroud of a dead virgin and set the cloth on fire to
        stop the haunting. With a help of Fikri, a police officer, Feli and
        Sarah set off to find that piece of fabric, and bring it to a railway
        carriage that is said to be haunted.</image:caption
