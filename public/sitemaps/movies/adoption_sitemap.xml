        >Tatek Tadesse's now classic 2003 "Gudifecha", had a deeper exploration
        of social issues, targeting at the sinister and corrosive effects of
        marital infidelity, bigamy, incest and the widely held Ethiopian
        practices of keeping family secrets. It is the story of a young child
        from poor peasant family adopted by a middleclass family and his
        adoptive sister. Their seemingly a brother-and sister relationship into
        a love affair is both clandestine and exciting, when they realize that
        they are not biologically related.</image:caption
