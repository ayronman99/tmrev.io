        Over the last 50 years, the British Touring Car Championship has
        entertained more people than any other domestic series, with great
        racing, great personalities and often more than a dash of controversy.
        Over that time, the series has changed from a largely amateur affair,
        using standard road cars, to the sophisticated professional enterprise
        of the 21st century. From the varied archives of 50 years of racing and
        the reminiscences of several of the 32 champions, this exclusive DVD
        traces those changes and relives some of the amazing events that have
        made the British Touring Car Championship the iconic and exhilarating
        racing competition it is today. Complete with a bonus DVD showing some
        of the all time classic races, this 2 disc DVD is a must for any BTCC
        fan!.... "Four hours of fun" Autosport</image:caption
