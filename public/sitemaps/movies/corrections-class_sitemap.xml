        >Lena is a bright, disabled girl who, after years spent studying at
        home, is keen to get back to school. She is assigned to a special class
        for disabled pupils who have to present themselves before a school
        commission at the end of the year in order to prove that they merit
        being moved back into a "normal" class. Her enervated teachers, however,
        show absolutely no desire to motivate the students and help them
        improve; on the contrary, they try to quash right from the start any
        interest Lena shows in more complex study material. Nevertheless, Lena
        soon involves herself in the school routine and gets together with
        classmate Anton. Yet their transparent happiness is not to everyone's
        liking and repercussions soon follow.</image:caption
