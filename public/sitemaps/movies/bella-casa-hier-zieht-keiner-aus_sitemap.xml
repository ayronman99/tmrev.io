        >Bella is a single mother business and mother trapped in the normal
        everyday insanity. Nevertheless, she is happy. But from now on,
        everything gets out of hand. The house, in which the elderly-shared
        apartment of Bella's father and their own physiotherapy practice are
        located, is to be sold and renovated. Bella would not be Bella if she
        was not determined and would fight with all her might against the
        injustice and sale of the house. But as she juggles with family, her
        practice, PR campaigns, demos and squatters, Bella needs to realize that
        even her power is not endless.</image:caption
