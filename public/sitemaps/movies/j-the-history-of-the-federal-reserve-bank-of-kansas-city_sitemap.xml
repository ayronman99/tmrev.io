        >In 1913 Congress created the Federal Reserve to bring financial
        stability to the nation after a number of banking panics, with a mix of
        regional banks and a central bank board. Congressmen Robert L. Owen and
        Carter Glass helped pass the Federal Reserve Act with the help of
        compromises led by President Woodrow Wilson. The Federal Reserve Bank of
        Kansas City was begun in 1914, led by Jo Zach Miller, Jr., along with
        local bankers such as William T. Kemper. With the bank rapidly growing,
        about 1920 a new 21 story building was built at 9th and Grand that at
        one time held the offices of the Bureau of Investigation and President
        Harry S. Truman.</image:caption
