        >Bill Hopkins hosts a TV show called Truth Files, which deals with such
        topics of UFOs and government conspiracies. He is also haunted by
        reoccurring nightmarish dreams of UFOs and alien beings, in which he
        can't piece together. He later receives a mysterious package which
        contains a mini audio recorder with a message from a man, who claims to
        have been part of top secret Black Ops mission to the far side of the
        moon. Bill meets with the mysterious man, who claims that the moon is
        occupied by alien intelligence that have been monitoring us for
        thousands of years with an agenda for humanity.</image:caption
