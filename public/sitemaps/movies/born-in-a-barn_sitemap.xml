        >An intimate and occasionally humorous look into the extraordinary
        erotic lives of four seemingly ordinary people, BORN IN A BARN takes us
        deep into the world of ponyplay, a fetish in which enthusiasts role-play
        as human ponies and handlers. Revealing the complex motives that drive
        each character to pursue this unusual passion and following them as they
        each confront the questions that being an erotic equine present, BORN IN
        A BARN is a film about finding an identity in the pursuit of an
        unconventional desire.</image:caption
