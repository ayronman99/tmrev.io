        >Dr. Emma Collins and her team are spending their third summer on the
        island of Little Happy studying the effect of climate change on the
        great white sharks who come to the nearby nursery every year to give
        birth. Along with the last two inhabitants of this former fishing
        village, their peaceful life is disrupted when a "scientific" team led

        sharks.</image:caption
