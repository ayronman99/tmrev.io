        >Wan Fei (Joey Yung) is a promising Chinese Opera singer who is secretly
        in love with Ho Fung (Nicholas Tse). She plans to sing for him from the
        stage, but, in a tragic accident, dies mid-song. Years later, Wan Fei's
        ghost returns, and finds that part of her spirit has been reincarnated
        in the form of Chor-bat (Eason Chan). Wan Fei still longs to sing her
        song for her lover, and, after much humorous confusion, her dream is
        fulfilled.</image:caption
