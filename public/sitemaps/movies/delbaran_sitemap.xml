        >Acclaimed director Abolfazl Jalili offers a compassionate story of the
        young Afghan refugee who lives illegally in Iran. 14-year-old Kaim
        drifts to the Delbaran crossing on the Afghan-Iran border, where he
        finds work at a coffee shop frequented by truck drivers. He feels at
        home in this small oasis of friendliness, though the sounds of war can
        be heard in the background, violent bandits prowl the roads, and opium
        is everywhere. As we watch Kaim run from one task to another day after
        day, we soon realize that we are watching a boy who is being cheated out
        of his childhood.</image:caption
