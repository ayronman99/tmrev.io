        >Ramiro is a theater actor who lives estranged from his father and half
        brother. One morning, he runs into a suicide, who says he is an evil
        omen. Despite Ramiro´s efforts, the young man dies before his eyes,
        which leads him to believe that he has caught his bad luck. From then
        on, his life turns upside down, at the same time as he gets together
        with his family to fulfill his father´s last wish: to find the love of
        his life and say goodbye to her.</image:caption
