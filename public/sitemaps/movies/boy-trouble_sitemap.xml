        >Take a couple of jiggers of testosterone, add sparks, shake well, and
        you end up with a fast-paced comedy about gay men spinning gossip,
        looking fabulous, and keeping their men. Joey, a kept man, has been in a
        relationship with his Sugar Daddy for 10 years. Rumors abound that his
        Daddy is leaving him for a younger boy-toy fresh into town. With no
        skills other than mixing a martini, Joey fears not only losing the man
        he loves but also the lush lifestyle.</image:caption
