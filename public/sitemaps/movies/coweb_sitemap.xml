        >Mandy slaves away at two jobs struggling to support her family while
        dreaming about resurrecting her father's martial arts academy, a once
        famous school now forgotten since an accident took his leg. When Mandy
        rescues wealthy businessman Ho Kwan from muggers he offers her a job as
        his bodyguard, and she agrees when he also offers to support her family
        and restore her father's academy. Before long, kidnappers appear and

        reach Ho Kwan, Mandy will have to join the tournament and gamble with
