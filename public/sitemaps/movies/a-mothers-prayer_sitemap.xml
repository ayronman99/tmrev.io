        >A Mother's Prayer, starring Robin Givens (Tyler Perry's The Family That
        Preys), Johnny Gill (legendary R&B singer), Shirley Murdock (Man of Her
        Dreams) and Jermaine Crawford (HBO's The Wire), tells the compelling,
        heartwarming tale of family members torn apart by their individual
        struggles. The only thing that can truly bring the family back together
        is a mother's dying wishes. With a lot of love, this family is about to
        learn the true meaning of the saying: the family that prays together
        stays together. Come along on an emotional journey through song,
        laughter and triumph.</image:caption
