        >Director Entrop follows Lalla Weiss for a year, the spokeswoman of the
        national Sinti and Roma organisation. Weiss emphasises that the Roma and
        Sinti have been denied a place in our culture for seven hundred years,
        and that this is only recently and gradually changing. She herself is
        the living proof of the fact that things can change: she is married to
        Kees, a civilian, and as his wife she takes the lead in the traditional
        male dominated Roma and Sinti societies.</image:caption
