        >British artist Phil Collins has made work in conflicted geopolitical
        sites around the world, including Baghdad, Belfast, Bogotá, and
        Ramallah, creating nuanced representations of people and places. In a
        departure from many documentaries and site-specific practice, Collins
        engages politics and pop culture in tandem, often soliciting the
        participation of the communities in which he works. His video
        installation Dünya Dinlemiyor (Turkish for "the world won't listen")
        features young people in Istanbul performing karaoke versions of songs
        by the 1980s band The Smiths. Within the politically fraught context of
        Istanbul, The Smiths' melancholic pop takes on new poignancy, asking us
        to listen to what the rest of the world won't. Collins was a nominee for
        the 2006 Turner Prize.</image:caption
