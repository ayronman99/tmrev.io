        >The first Cylon war has been raging for 10 years and a young Ensign
        William Adama joins the fleet. Disappointed not to be assigned to a
        fighter but to a freighter, his co-pilot also isn't too keen on having a
        rookie flying his aircraft as he has only a short time before he again
        becomes a civilian. Their cargo is a civilian scientist, but they no
        sooner leave than she has new orders for them and a new destination.
        Although she’s less than forthcoming about the details, Adama is
        keen—particularly as it involves going into Cylon controlled space.
        However, nothing is as it seems.</image:caption
