        >Casey Jones is the story of a quirky young man with an irresistible
        propensity for violence. A lifelong outcast, Casey learned at a young
        age to channel his brutal urges into sports, but after being kicked off
        the local hockey team for excessive force during practice, Casey moves
        back in with his worrisome mother to seek solace at his boyhood home.
        His retreat is soon interrupted though when a vicious gang of street
        punks, the Purple Dragons, savagely beat him with pipes for attempting
        to remove their graffiti. After narrowly escaping the encounter with his
        life, Casey vows to single-handedly rid his neighborhood of crime. Armed
        with a golf bag loaded with clubs and sporting a fearful hockey mask,
        Casey stalks the alleyways by night, mercilessly trouncing any
        delinquents unlucky enough to cross his path. The misguided crusader
        soon goes off the deep end, and an unlikely ally from the sewers is
        forced to intervene before the vigilante annihilates every criminal in
        the city.</image:caption
