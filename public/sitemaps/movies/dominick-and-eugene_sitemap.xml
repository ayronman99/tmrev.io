        >Dominick and Eugene are twins, but Dominick is a little bit slow due do
        an accident in his youth. They live together, with Dominick working as
        garbage man to put Eugene through medical school. Their relationship
        becomes strained when Eugene must decide between his devotion to his
        brother, or his need to go away to complete his training. Things are
        also not helped by Dominick's co-worker, or Eugene's budding
        romance.</image:caption
