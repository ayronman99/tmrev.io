        >Ram Chandra is a Tamilian who lives in a shanty hut in Bombay's
        Dharavi, along with his mom and a younger sister. He dream is to attend
        school, which he does so, after his sister is loaned out to a beggar to
        collect alms, but she is unable to withstand hunger for long and passes
        away. Ram leaves home and subsequently works hard, studies, becomes rich
        and constructs several colleges to accommodate needy students. One such
        student he accommodates is a new arrival from Allahabad, Raja, and he
        arranges his admission in Ram Chandra College for Business Management
        along with full board and shelter. He also helps Raja sort out his
        personal problems, including his romance with a young woman he met at
        the Cyber Caf√© and then at Bandra Railway Station. While Ram Chandra is
        busy arranging his daughter's marriage with Rajesh Gupta, the only son
        of a multi-millionaire and educationist, he is quite unaware that the
        object of Raja's affections is none other than Roja, his very own
        daughter.</image:caption
