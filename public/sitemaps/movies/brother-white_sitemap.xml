        >Synopsis James White (White) is one of dozens of associate pastors at a
        mega church in Southern California under the tutelage of television
        evangelist Johnny Kingman (Wise). He always longed to have his own
        church and jumps at the opportunity to become pastor of the impoverished
        Divine Faith Apostolic Church in Atlanta. His wife and two children
        arenâ€™t very enthusiastic about his assignment. Neither is the
        congregation itself, but they will have to learn to trust each other and
        pull together to save the church from a corrupt banker anxious to
        foreclose. It will take a musical miracle, supplied by BeBe Winans
        himself, to save them all in this heartfelt, family-friendly
        comedy.</image:caption
