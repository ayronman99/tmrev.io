        >Everyone thinks they know what is best for Aixa. A pregnant teenager
        who is hesitant about giving birth to a baby unexpectedly. Carmen, her
        young grandmother and head of numerous matriarchy where he lives, wants
        to prevent her to repeat the history of the women in his house: being a
        mother at age 15. Ramon, a young criminal and father of the child, Aixa
        threat: "If you take off the dude, I'll kill you." Amazed at the thought
        of a child, seems to have a slightest hint of concern to his brutal
        life.</image:caption
