        >Bloom Towne is a small-town sheriff under the thumb of the
        well-established, deeply influential Mayor Dick Cavanaugh's family. When
        Bloom's two teenage sons, Nate and Skylar accidentally shoot and kill
        Dick during a deer-hunt, Bloom's long-held allegiance to the reigning
        Cavanaugh clan is tested. Skylar (still a minor) decides to take the
        wrap for his older brother Nate, claiming he fired the fatal shot. The
        Cavanaugh family's quick retaliation sends Skylar on his way to county
        jail, soon to be tried as an adult. Desperate and guilt-ridden, Nate
        breaks Skylar out of jail and sets off a chain of lawless acts, which
        send them deep into the woods and on the run. Bloom's choice between the
        law and his sons leads to revelations of old family secrets that
        threaten to destroy everything he loves.</image:caption
