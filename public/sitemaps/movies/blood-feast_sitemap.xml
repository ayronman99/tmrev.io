        >Fuad Ramses and his family have moved from the United States to France,
        where they run a American diner. Since business is not going too well,
        Fuad also works night shifts in a museum of Egyptian culture. During
        these long lonely nights he is repeatedly drawn to a statue representing
        the seductive ancient goddess ISHTAR. He becomes more and more allured
        by the goddess as she speaks to him in visions. Eventually he succumbs
        to her deadly charms.</image:caption
