        >Dakota Smith is an experienced policeman with a problem: his partner
        was shot dead, and corrupt cops are responsible. Dak's investigation
        leads him to widespread corruption in the department, as well as a
        corrupt district attorney. Smith finds an unlikely ally in timid
        photographer Nick Gleem. While Gleem unearths clues about the bad guys,
        Dak fends off attacks on his own life. While he's not in gun battles
        with these local villains, divorced father Dak has no shortage of lady
        friends to keep him happy.</image:caption
