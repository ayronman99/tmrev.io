        >The younger sister of a feared African American crime boss and the
        nephew of his powerful Latina nemesis go on the run in a customized
        Cadillac convertible packed with $20 million in drugs in this romantic
        crime drama. Julia and Romano have fallen in love, but their families
        will never let them be together. Desperate, the two young lovers hit the
        road in a vintage Cadillac. But their getaway vehicle has some rather
        precious cargo stashed away in the customized tires, and it isn't long
        before their furious families, and the Russian mob, are hot on their
        trail.</image:caption
