        >It's not 1985 anymore...it's 1986, and Chuck Steel is 'the best God
        damn cop on the force' according to his long suffering boss, Captain
        Jack Schitt. But even this maverick, renegade, loose cannon, lone wolf,
        cop on the edge, who doesn't play by the rules has his work cut out when
        the Governor of LA decides to reduce the licensing hours for clubs and
        bars triggering a sudden, inexplicable spate of high profile
        disappearances in the city. The disappearances all have the same thing
        in common, a crime scene covered in blood but with no sign of the
        victim. The police are perplexed until they get a break in the case when
        one of the victims manages to escape. Chuck goes to interview the victim
        at the hospital but is confronted by a crazed old man who introduces
        himself as Abraham Van Rental. He warns a disbelieving Chuck that an
        evil scourge is about to descend on the city of Los Angeles - the
        scourge of the TRAMPIRES - a mutated hybrid of vampire and
        tramp.</image:caption
