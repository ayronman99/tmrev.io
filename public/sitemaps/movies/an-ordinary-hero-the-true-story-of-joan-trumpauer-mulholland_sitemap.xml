        >The amazing true story of civil rights pioneer Joan Trumpauer
        Mulholland, An Ordinary Hero is directed by award-winning filmmaker Loki
        Mulholland, who captures his mother's story and learns about her courage
        and the role she played in changing American history. As a white girl
        growing up in the South, Joan witnessed the ugly realities of
        segregation and racism firsthand and vowed to one day change it. By the
        time she was 19, she had already joined the Freedom Riders and
        participated in over three dozen sit-ins and protests. Despite being
        attacked by angry mobs, put on death row in the notorious Parchman
        Penitentiary, and coming face-to-face with the KKK, Joan never wavered
        from her belief that we are all created equal.</image:caption
