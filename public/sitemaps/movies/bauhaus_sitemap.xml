        >Weimar, 1921. The life of 20-year-old Lotte Brendel seems to be
        predetermined. Her father sees her as a future wife and mother on the
        side of a man who is to take over the parental carpentry business. But
        the idiosyncratic Lotte joins a group of young artists against the will
        of her family, applies at the Bauhaus and is accepted. The Weimar
        Bauhaus, under the direction of the visionary Walter Gropius, aspires
        not only to combine arts and crafts, but also to find the place for the
        "New Man". In the student Paul Seligmann Lotte finds a supporter and her
        great love.</image:caption
