        >Students, including Aoi Nishino, take part in class and sports activity
        at a prestigious high school. Aoi Nishino is a member of the school's
        archery club. He practices archery studiously and doesn't socialize much
        with the other students. His childhood friend Haruka Seno is also a
        member of the archery club, but she worries about Aoi Nishino. One day,
        thunder strikes the school grounds. After that, the ordinary lives of
        the students changes drastically. Many samurai descend on the school
        grounds. It appears that the entire school has traveled back in time to
        the Sengoku period. Making things worse, they realize that they are in
        the time right before the Battle of Okehazama takes
        place.</image:caption
