        >Paranormal investigator and documentary filmmaker Chad Calek returns to
        his hometown of Persia, Iowa in hopes to put an end to the 20 year reign
        of suffering that his family has endured due to an overwhelming amount
        of intense negative paranormal activity. Armed with the support and
        paranormal knowledge of best friend and paranormal investigator Ryan
        Buell , as well as world renown psychic Lorraine Warren, who's also
        known for her work as the primary investigator in the Amityville and
        Enfield Poltergeist cases, Calek is determined to not only solve the
        mysteries as to why the paranormal phenomena initially began, but also
        to finally bring an end to the activity that has been tormenting his
        family for over two decades</image:caption
