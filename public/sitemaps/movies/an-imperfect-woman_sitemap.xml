        >Lyubanya, a hairdresser who has lost her job, and her eleven-year-old
        son find themselves in a difficult situation. She tries to borrow money
        from his girlfriend Simkina. She agrees to help, but only on the
        condition that Lyubanya will help her regain the man she loved, a
        certain Valeriy. Lyubanya must "accidentally" get acquainted with him
        and pretend to be his ideal, and when he falls in love with the "woman
        of his dreams" â€” leave him. Then Simkina will appear to "glue" Valeriy's
        broken heart, and at the same time their broken relationship. Out of
        desperation, Lyubanya joins in this game, but very quickly realizes that
        she has fallen in love. The heroine faces the question: how to tell
        Valeriy the truth about himself and their "casual"
        acquaintance?</image:caption
