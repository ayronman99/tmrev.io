        >Considered by many to be the most influential American artist in the
        second half of the 20th century, Andy Warhol used commercial
        silk-screening techniques to create identical mass-produced images on
        canvas, and then added variations in color to give each print of an
        edition a different look. His quirky series of films (many shot at his
        Manhattan studio loft called "The Factory") were also
        influential.</image:caption
