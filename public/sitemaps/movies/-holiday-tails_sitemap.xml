        >Rod and Katherine Wright are enjoying their retirement in Florida – or
        so they’re telling each other. Actually, Rod’s been bored with nothing
        to do, and Katherine misses her kids back home, especially with
        Christmas right around the corner. At least they’ve made friends with
        their new neighbor Lisa, who’s a golden retriever fan like them – Rod
        and Katherine’s dog Jake has three new puppy playmates, Mario, Luigi and
        Pasquale. But when Jake and the puppies take off during a walk with Lisa
        and interrupt a wedding proposal, Lisa is mortified to discover the
        proposer is none other than her
        lifelong-friend-turned-boyfriend-turned-ex, David. Everyone can see that
        David and Lisa are meant to be together. Everyone, that is, except for
        David and Lisa. Now, with David’s wedding approaching, they must decide
        whether to leave their love in the past, or to give it another chance.
        With a little help from Rod and Katherine and four lovable pups, it’s
        sure to be a Christmas to remember.</image:caption
