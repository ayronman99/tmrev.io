        >Pier Ulmann lives from hand-to-mouth in Paris, between construction
        work and petty theft that he commits on behalf of Rachid, his only
        “family”. But life catches up with him the day his father is found dead
        in the street after a long decline. The black sheep of a rich Antwerp
        family who deals in diamonds, he has left his son nothing, apart from
        the story of his banishment from the Ulmann family and a thirst for
        revenge.</image:caption
