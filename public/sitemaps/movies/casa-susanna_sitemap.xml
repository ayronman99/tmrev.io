        >In the 50s and 60s, deep in the American countryside at the foot of the
        Catskills, a small wooden house with a barn behind it was home to the
        first clandestine network of cross-dressers. Diane and Kate are now 80
        years old. At the time, they were men and part of this secret
        organization. Today, they relate this forgotten but essential chapter of
        the early days of trans-identity. It is a story full of noise and fury,
        rich in extraordinary characters, including the famous Susanna, who had
        the courage to create this refuge that came to be known as Casa
        Susanna.</image:caption
