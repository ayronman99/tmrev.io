        >What happens if you take the law into your own hands, start correcting
        the legal system on your own initiative? Hans Croiset, Andr√© van den
        Heuvel, Bram van der Vlugt and Kitty Courbois in their roles of aged
        resistance heroes do not think this is such a bad idea; in fact, it is
        what they already did during World War II. Back then, they formed a
        sworn resistance gang. The occasion for their renewed fighting spirit is
        the brutal robbery and murder of Marjan, one of the members of their
        former group. Past and present start blending. In a controlled tempo,
        alert to detail and acting, a story unravels that focuses on Hans
        Croiset in the role of Simon, a retired teacher of Dutch. He makes
        contact with the underworld, meeting the Slavic Goran, who starts
        feeling sympathy for the old man. Eventually, fate lies in Simon's
        hands.</image:caption
