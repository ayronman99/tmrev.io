        >Bikes vs Cars depicts a global crisis that we all deep down know we
        need to talk about: Climate, earth's resources, cities where the entire
        surface is consumed by the car. An ever-growing, dirty, noisy traffic
        chaos. The bike is a great tool for change, but the powerful interests
        who gain from the private car invest billions each year on lobbying and
        advertising to protect their business. In the film we meet activists and
        thinkers who are fighting for better cities, who refuse to stop riding
        despite the increasing number killed in traffic.</image:caption
