        >From the beginning of time, a man walks in front of his flock to the
        rhythm of the seasons. The nomadic shepherd belongs to our collective
        imagination. Joan "Pipa" is one of the last representatives of an
        ancient tradition. We accompany him on his last nomadic trip to the
        Catalan Pyrenees. Day after day he we share his intimacy, we discover
        the past and present of a man who loves his job and breathes the joy of
        living freely in nature. But the abandonment of land, industrialization
        and rampant growth, urbanistic fever, the multiplication of new
        infrastructure and now climate change end the dream and lead to an
        uncertain future. Is the disappearance of transhumance a sign of
        progress, or the death of our civilization?.</image:caption
