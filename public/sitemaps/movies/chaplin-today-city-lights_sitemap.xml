        >In 1928, as the talkies threw the film industry and film language into
        turmoil, Chaplin decided that his Tramp character would not be heard.
        City Lights would not be a talking picture, but it would have a
        soundtrack. Chaplin personally composed a musical score and sound
        effects for the picture. With Peter Lord, the famous co-creator of
        Chicken Run and Wallace &amp; Gromit, we see how Chaplin became the king
        of slapstick comedy and the superstar of the movies.</image:caption
