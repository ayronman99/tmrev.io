        >Amol Rajan talks to 19-year old Greta Thunberg, the climate activist
        who has become the unlikely voice of a global youth. Thunberg isn't a
        politician or a scientist, nor is she the first to campaign against
        climate change. However, since overcoming severe childhood depression to
        focus the world's attention on the plight of the planet, the Swedish
        student has become symbol for a generation which - as she puts it - is
        not being listened to by older people who won't suffer the consequences.
        In a challenging and wide-ranging conversation, Rajan discusses with
        Thunberg her latest book and interrogates some of the solutions it
        posits to tackle climate change. They explore green policy, climate
        justice, greenwashing and the role of both politics and protest in
        effecting change. Thunberg also shares the personal cost she has paid in
        being a global game-changer and offers a rare insight into the real
        Greta Thunberg.</image:caption
