        >A road movie set in Iraq in 2003 during the fall of Saddam. Two Kurds
        are looking for the parents of a five-year-old boy who has been found in
        the street in tears. His name is Saddam too. At the same time the boy's
        parents are looking for him everywhere, worried because of the boy's
        name which is now taboo. All the attempts of the two Kurds to get rid of
        the child fail: neither the Americans nor the men of religion at the
        mosque want him. Little Saddam begins to become a real problem. In the
        streets and all around them, they are surrounded by the chaos and crazy
        atmosphere of those days, with violence always on the verge of
        exploding.</image:caption
