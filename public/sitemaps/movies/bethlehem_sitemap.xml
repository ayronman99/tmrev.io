        >Bethlehem tells the story of the unlikely bond between Razi, an Israeli
        secret service officer, and his Palestinian informant Sanfur, the
        younger brother of a senior Palestinian militant. Razi recruited Sanfur
        when he was just 15, and developed a very close, almost fatherly
        relationship to him. Now 17, Sanfur tries to navigate between Razi’s
        demands and his loyalty to his brother, living a double life and lying
        to both men. Co-written by director Yuval Adler and Ali Waked—an Arab
        journalist who spent years in the West Bank—Bethlehem gives an
        unparalleled, moving and authentic portrait of the complex reality
        behind the news.</image:caption
