        >The Hawke’s Bay earthquake was New Zealand’s worst civil disaster. Over
        250 people died following the 7.8 quake on 3 February 1931. In this
        full-length documentary, director Gaylene Preston (Hope and Wire)
        gathers eyewitness accounts from survivors, including kuia Hana Lyola
        Cotter, who recounts joining the rescue effort as a teen, poet Lauris
        Edmond, and a student from Greenmeadows Seminary. Included is
        eye-opening newsreel footage of the damage. Earthquake was nominated for
        Best Popular Documentary at the 2006 Qantas TV Awards; it won best sound
        at the NZ Screen Awards.</image:caption
