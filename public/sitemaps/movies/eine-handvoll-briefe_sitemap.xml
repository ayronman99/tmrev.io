        >Kristin turns 40. She is an attractive single woman who works in her
        profession, has a relationship with her boss and is somehow alone. Her
        best friend since childhood, Lenny, gives her a surprise suitcase for
        her birthday. For years, unclaimed suitcases are auctioned off at the
        airport without knowing the contents. Lenny bought one of these
        suitcases for Kristin. Of course Kristin is curious and finds in this
        suitcase, which must have belonged to a woman, a bundle of love letters.
        More and more she falls for these letters and the unknown who wrote
        them.</image:caption
