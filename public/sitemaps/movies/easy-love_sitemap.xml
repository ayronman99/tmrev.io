        >easy love is the experimental fiction debut of Tamer Jandali. His way
        of working shifted between documentary and fiction when he followed
        seven men and women from Cologne on their search for a balance between
        emotional security and sensual fulfillment. In four months of shooting
        those protagonists acted as braver versions of themselves. The camera
        opened the possibility to pursue their unlived dreams, fears and
        fantasies and ultimately experiencing them in reality. By shooting in a
        small team, always on the edge between documentary and fiction, Tamer
        Jandali created space for intimacy and a new form of cinematic
        authenticity.</image:caption
