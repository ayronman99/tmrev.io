        >This documentary addresses the plethora of issues that have been raised
        in the wake of the events of September 11, 2001. Turning a critical eye
        to the actions of George W. Bush's government before, during, and after
        the tragedy, director Stephen Marshall has assembled a collection of
        experts to address questions that have been overlooked in the turbulence
        of the times. He exposes connections between the hijackers, Pakistani
        intelligence (ISI), and the CIA, and examines the role that a hunger for
        oil has played all along.</image:caption
