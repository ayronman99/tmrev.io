        >"Coming out of Nkuta" is the Cameroonian equivalent of our "coming
        out". This documentary, directed by CÃ©line Metger, deals with
        homosexuality in Cameroon. What a shock to learn that homosexuality is
        penalized in Cameroon and to see men in prison for the sole reason of
        being homosexual. We follow the struggle of Alice, a lawyer who fights
        for the cause of homosexuals and for the revision of the criminal law.
        The director devoted two years of her life to this documentary. She
        quickly established links with gays and lesbians. The documentary is
        both revolting by the treatment inflicted on homosexuals and endearing
        by the confidences of these men and women rejected by Cameroonian
        society. And what courage to have accepted to testify
        openly!</image:caption
