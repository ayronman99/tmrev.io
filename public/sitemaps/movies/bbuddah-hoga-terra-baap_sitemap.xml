        >After a series of bomb blasts in Mumbai, ACP Karan Malhotra announces
        that he will bring in the culprits responsible within a very short
        period of time as well attempts to convince his college sweetheart,
        Tanya P. Nath, to marry him. He then sets about interrogating several
        suspects so much so that an underworld gangster, Kabir, is compelled to
        hire an assassin to do away with him. The potential killer, Viju, is an
        uptight older ex-convict as well as a former gangster, who now runs a
        pub in Paris, and is willing to kill Karan. As he sets about this
        gruesome task, he comes across an old flame, Kamini, as well as his
        estranged wife, Sita - and it is these encounters that may well be the
        turning point in this life that may convince him to leave the bombs and
        Bandooks behind and spend the rest of his life praying and watching the
        Bhakti Channel.</image:caption
