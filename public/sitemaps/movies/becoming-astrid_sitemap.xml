        >When Astrid Lindgren was very young something happened that affected
        her profoundly, and this combination of both miracle and calamity came
        to shape her entire life. It was an event that transformed her into one
        of the most inspiring women of our age and the storyteller a whole world
        would come to love. This is the story of when a young Astrid, despite
        the expectations of her time and religious upbringing, decided to break
        free from society's norms and follow her heart.</image:caption
