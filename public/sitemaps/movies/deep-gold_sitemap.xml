        >Amy Sanchez (Bebe Pham) is a champion free diver who breaks a crucial
        free diving record. Her boyfriend, Tony dela Cruz (Jack Prinya), an Air
        Force Pilot, mysteriously disappears along with his plane that carries
        gold worth millions of dollars that was to be taken to the Central Bank.

        actually happened accompanied by her sister Jess Sanchez (Jaymee Ong).
        She moves on her adventurous journey not knowing that she herself is
        going to get entangled into a trap of lies that leads her to a much
        complex conspiracy.</image:caption
