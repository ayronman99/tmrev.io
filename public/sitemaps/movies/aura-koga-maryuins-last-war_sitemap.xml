        >Satou Ichirou once called himself 'Maryuuin Kouga' and behaved as if he
        were a hero in a fantasy world. His strange behavior caused his
        classmates to bully him and he left the school. At his new school, he
        tries to behave like a normal boy, but one day he meets a girl who
        cosplays with a blue cape. She calls herself "a researcher traveling
        from the outer world to search for the 'Dragon Terminal'". At first,
        Ichirou rejects the girl, Satou Ryouko, because her behavior reminds him
        of his embarrassing past, but he changes his mind after seeing her
        getting bullied. In order to bring Ryouko back to real life, Ichirou
        accepts her and his past and begins the final battle as Maryuuin
        Kouga.</image:caption
