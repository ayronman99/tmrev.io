        >Based on the best-selling book 'My Story' this feature length drama
        goes beyond the headlines to tell an intimate story about secrets and
        one woman's struggle to have them heard. In 1993 Louise Nicholas made
        her first shocking accusations about being raped by policemen. Some
        believed her, many didn't. CONSENT tells the story of the senior
        policeman who went to great lengths to help her fight her case, the
        journalist who exposed the truth, and the family at the center of the
        storm.</image:caption
