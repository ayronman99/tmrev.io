        >Aleksander Laime, romanticist and dreamer at heart, went deep into the
        jungle of Venezuela in search of Jimmy Angel’s famed ‘Diamond River’.
        While it was never publicized if he succeeded in his search, residents
        of Canaima still refer to him as their ancestors once named him – ‘The
        King of Diamonds’. Through gaining trust, Laime was to see something no
        other man had ever seen, but was forbidden from entering the place ever
        again.</image:caption
