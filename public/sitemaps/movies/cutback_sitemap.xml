        >High School senior Luke Harris dreams of just one thing... pro surfing.
        But Luke's parents have other ideas: pick a college and grow up! When
        Luke learns that a spot is opening up on the local surf team, he see's
        his big chance to prove to his parents that he can make it as a surfer
        and avoid being shipped off to school. When a devastating tragedy
        strikes, Luke is forced to take a hard look at his life with the help of
        the beautiful "church-girl" Emily and his youth pastor.</image:caption
