        >Bear with Us is a crazy romp about a guy who attempts to propose to his
        girlfriend in the most romantic way possible, but his plan starts to
        fall apart when a Ravenous bear stumbles on their charming cabin in the
        woods. Think "Jaws" but much funnier and with a bear instead of a shark.
        It's a total comedy of errors that takes a comical look at just how far
        we'll go to preserve our relationships.</image:caption
