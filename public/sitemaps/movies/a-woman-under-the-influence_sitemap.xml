        >Mabel Longhetti, desperate and lonely, is married to a Los Angeles
        municipal construction worker, Nick. Increasingly unstable, especially
        in the company of others, she craves happiness, but her extremely
        volatile behavior convinces Nick that she poses a danger to their family
        and decides to commit her to an institution for six months. Alone with a
        trio of kids to raise on his own, he awaits her return, which holds more
        than a few surprises.</image:caption
