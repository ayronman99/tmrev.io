        >Lock the doors and turn off the lights as The Professor guides you
        through three tales of terror. Discover the evils that fester in the
        minds of the demented in this horror anthology. In "Girls Night Out",
        two girls plan on going to a party and having some fun. Instead they end
        up in a life or death situation with an uninvited guest. In "The Creep",
        a young woman's fears and insecurities blind her from the truth and
        sends her spiraling down a road that can only end in death. But whose
        death? Featuring Scott Schiaffo (Clerks, Vulgar) as Mo. In "Blood Moon
        Rising", a nurse bites off more than she can chew when she sets her
        sites on her wealthy employer. Settle in and brace yourself for an
        evening of chills and thrills.</image:caption
