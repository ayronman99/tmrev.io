        >Focusing on football programs in the Southeastern, Southwest and
        Atlantic Coast Conferences, Breaking The Huddle: The Integration of
        College Football chronicles the heyday of football programs at
        historically black colleges and universities, and explores the profound
        effect of the Civil Rights movement of the '60s on the racial status quo
        of college athletics. The story culminates with the Sept. 1970 game
        played in Birmingham between the University of Southern California, and
        the University of Alabama.</image:caption
