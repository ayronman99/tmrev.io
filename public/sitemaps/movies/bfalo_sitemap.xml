        >After three years behind bars, Búfalo has decided to change his life:
        resume his relationship with his son, get organized, get a normal job,
        not make any more mistakes. His past, however, does not intend to let
        him go and convinces him to take one last hit, but things go very wrong
        and the debt is now not with society, but with Tano, a complicated guy
        that he does not plan to wait for.</image:caption
