        >A Blanc-Biehn production centered around the idea of a governmentally
        designed drug created to help correct or strategically alter perceptions
        gathered during times of trauma or stress. Slated as being a substance
        that may help solve issues with everything from racial tensions, PTSD
        and geopolitic battles, first a focused study is needed to see how
        people respond to treatment and what dosages might be needed. Four
        couples are chosen to test this drug, and soon find their memories and
        sanity challenged.</image:caption
