        >In 1980, a small plane carrying the Prime Minister, the Defense
        Minister and six others crashed during takeoff in Camarate, Portugal,
        killing all on board. The police investigation decided it was an
        accident caused by pilot error. But controversy raged for twenty years,
        and the Parliament investigated it no less than six times. Finally, in
        2000, in response to a suit by the families of the survivors, the High
        Court had to decide whether to open a criminal investigation, or close
        the case forever.</image:caption
