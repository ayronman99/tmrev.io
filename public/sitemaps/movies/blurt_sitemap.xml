        >When nice-guy Jeremy Martin puts on mysterious virtual reality glasses
        at the mall, he suddenly loses his “inside voice” and starts spouting
        every thought he has out loud. Making matters worse, Jeremy is running
        for student council president against his classmate Milly, who is full
        of great ideas to improve the school. Desperate to get back to normal,
        Jeremy and his sister Victoria must figure out how to convince his brain
        that he can speak up for himself.</image:caption
