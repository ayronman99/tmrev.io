        >Featuring Bill’s trademark musical interludes, observations and stories
        of the road, Dandelion Mind will be based loosely on the theme of doubt
        (or will it?), as we follow Bill from his real-life saga of being
        trapped by the ash cloud, to his barely contained rants about celebrity,
        TV, creationism and Michael Winner. He demonstrates new instruments,
        both ancient and modern, he sings an internet love song, a lament about
        punk heroes, Iranian hip-hop, and plays a mean folk-bouzouki. Thomas the
        Doubter gets a new look, and Darwin’s curious obsessions and the myth of
        intelligent design are all worked over in Bailey’s own surreal style. He
        revisits the music of his youth, with a brand-new French Disco
        re-working of Gary Numan’s hit, Cars, played in his own inimitable way,
        and maybe some Wurzels-based remixes of classic German techno. Just your
        normal Bill Bailey gig, then. Filmed at The O2 in Dublin in October
        2010</image:caption
