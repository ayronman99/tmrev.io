        >Based on the horrifying true story of Americas first convicted
        cannibal, Alferd Packer (whose story was satirized in Tromas
        best-selling Cannibal! The Musical), Devoured takes a serious spin on
        the tale and features incredible suspense and gore effects in the vein
        of Dawn of the Dead and House of 1000 Corpses. In 1874, Alferd Packer
        led a gold mining expedition into Colorado, where he murdered, robbed
        and ate every miner in his camp. More than a century later, the
        identical killings and numerous disappearances are occurring. As the
        search for the killer proves neverending, one terrifying and
        unbelievable fact remains... Mr. Packer was still lurking out there...
        somewhere... just waiting to strike again!</image:caption
