        >Emmy-nominated comedian Damon Wayans, who's perhaps best known for his
        work on the groundbreaking comedy sketch show "In Living Color," has a
        knack for creating funny characters. But he plays his most hilarious
        character yet in this gut-busting HBO special filmed live in front of an
        appreciative audience: himself. Riffing on marriage, kids, work and a
        variety of other topics, Wayans proves he's still relevant in the
        cutthroat world of stand-up.</image:caption
