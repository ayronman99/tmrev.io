        >Short documentary included in the Highlander: The Search for Vengeance
        DVD. An interesting look at the process of bringing this American
        franchise over to Japan and gives a good idea at what it took to see it
        through to completion. Along the same lines there is an interview with
        Director Yoshiaki Kawajiri where he talks about his experience with
        working on the picture.</image:caption
