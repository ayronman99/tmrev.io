        >Based on his book, Michael Waltrip recounts the 2001 Daytona 500 and
        the lighting-fast transition from elation to mourning - as he took the
        checkered flag to win while Dale Earnhardt, his friend and team owner,
        crashed in Turn 4 behind him. Earnhardt's death and the events of the
        race had a profound effect on Waltrip, shown in this
        documentary.</image:caption
