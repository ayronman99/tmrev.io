        >Johnny Dow struggles to make a living at his small town gas station by
        charging motorists to see the electric guitar used by his late father a
        one-hit, rock and roll wonder. Legend has it the guitar was carved in
        the shape of a dragon's head and made in part from an ancient spear his
        father found in the crater of a shooting star. When Johnny's friend
        Eddie stumbles upon the other half of the spear he releases an ancient
        demon hungry for power and destruction. Mika a beautiful Chinese warrior
        who holds the secret to fighting Eddie and his army of kung fu,
        sugar-craving warriors reveals to Johnny that the only way to stop the
        evil spirit is to use the first half of the spear - the dragon on
        Johnny's guitar! Together Johnny and Mika set out to fight Eddie and his
        army, reunite the two halves of the spear, restore peace to the town and
        - of course - save the world!</image:caption
