        >Crackoholic , by Jonas Paulsson and Mikael Widerberg, is quite
        different to most other climbing movies. The style is somewhat similar
        to that of the classic Hard Grit, in that it provides a historical
        perspective to the climbing of the area. In this case Bohusln on the
        Swedish west coast. We also get to meet and listen to some of the
        climbers who, through the decades, have been important to the
        development, of difficulty as well as ethics, and hear their thoughts on
        climbing and risk. As would be expected, these thoughts range from
        profound to cliche. Of course, there's also a lot of climbing, from
        moderates to FA's of cutting edge "death" routes.</image:caption
