        >Nearly 15 years in the making, Chris Sullivan's Consuming Spirits is a
        meticulously constructed tour de force of experimental animation.
        Shooting frame by frame in 16mm, Sullivan seamlessly blends together a
        range of techniques—cutout animation, pencil drawing, collage, and
        stop-motion animation—into a distinct, signature visual style. In the
        process, he constructs a hypnotic, layered narrative, a suspenseful
        gothic tale that tracks the intertwined lives of three kindred spirits
        working at a local newspaper in a Midwestern rust belt town. The
        accumulation of these images builds to a great atmospheric effect,
        achieved through an adroit combination of inventive set design,
        ever-shifting visual perspectives, fluid camera movements, a vivid color
        palette, and a haunting music track. Sullivan succeeds in creating, with
        great artistry, a hermetic, self-contained world emanating from his own
        unique and vivid imagination. (Jon Gartenberg, Tribeca Film
        Festival)</image:caption
