        >In this work Mark Lewis highlights the gap between utopian visions and
        everyday realities. The camera glides around a complex network of empty
        walkways in South London’s soon-to-be-demolished Heygate Estate, with
        the seamless movement of a computer game. Every detail is precisely
        planned and produced, from the perfect spring weather to the child
        actors playing in communal spaces. We are forcefully drawn into the
        image as the camera glides through the estate’s narrow paths, creating a
        metaphor for the linear nature of film itself, always moving on. Through
        this travelling motion, the architecture of the Heygate Estate is
        animated as a constant stream of images and information, highlighting
        how we, as viewers, understand the world around us, and what impact it
        can have on us.</image:caption
