        >Alex Klein is a bankrupt real estate executive whose life is on a
        collision course. Not only do the market and his career look like a
        Trabant from before the fall of the Berlin Wall, but he has a wife who
        is thriving in success; a family whose habits are driving him insane;
        clients with bad taste and too much money. Not to mention 14-year-old
        baristas who think they know the difference between highland coffee
        beans, picked by virgins at midnight and the coffee from the local
        supermarket. So there's a lot getting on his nerves, so much so, that
        one day, when things become real serious, he can only weather the storm
        in his own repelling way.</image:caption
