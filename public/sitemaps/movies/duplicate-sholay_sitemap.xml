        >When Thakur Baldev Singh gets blinded by notorious bandit Gabbar Singh,
        he seeks the assistance of two former convicts, Jay and Veeru, to bring
        Gabbar before him so that he can mete out justice in his own way. This
        was the plot of the original 1975 classic, in this one too Baldev does
        seek the assistance of Veeru and Jay, but they come together with three
        other friends, namely Balli, Tara Singh, and Mithun (look-alikes of
        Sanjay Dutt, Sunny Deol, and Mithun Chakraborty respectively). Also
        seeking vengeance for her rape is Lajwanti, alias Daku Chutiya, who was
        raped by Gabbar. Lajwanti is none other than Basanti's sister, who
        dances in Chandni Bar. Gabbar is assisted by various bandits, including
        the Singh brothers: Jangal, Mangal, and Dangal, all escaped convicts.
        The Duplicates are also assisted by Shahenshah, and an Anil Kapoor
        look-alike. Watch the fun and frolic unfold as the Duplicates team up to
        fight the invincible Gabbar Singh.</image:caption
