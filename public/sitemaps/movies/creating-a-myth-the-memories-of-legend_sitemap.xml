        >This 51 minute documentary of the movie "Legend" can be found as an
        extra on the 2002 2-disc boxed-set 'Ultimate Edition' DVD release of
        "Legend". The first part of the documentary deals with the fruition of
        the idea and the making of the movie. It includes interviews with almost
        all the main participants of the feature, with the exception of actor
        Tom Cruise, who was a no show. The second half is much more fascinating
        and deals with what went wrong with the movie, and it's marketing
        failures.</image:caption
