        >Created on the initiative of the architect Nuno Portas as Secretary of
        State for Housing and Urban Development of the First Provisional
        Government, the Local Ambulatory Support Service (SAAL) was a housing
        assistance program promoted by Resident Associations. The Portuguese
        Architecture of 25th of April is SAAL - an unparalleled movement in the
        history of architecture thinking, which served as an example and
