        >During World War II, millions of Jews from all over Europe are deported
        and killed in German concentration camps. When the German troops invade
        Norway, the Norwegian Jews feel safe and protected. But anti-Semitism
        knows no borders and as the war escalates in Europe, the situation
        changes drastically. Suddenly, their radios are taken away; their
        passports are stamped with a big J and one day, all the men men over the
        age of 15 are arrested and taken to prisons camps. Many of the women
        left behind are too frightened to escape and are desperately waiting for
        their husbands and sons to come back home. On November 26, 1942,
        hundreds of Jews are picked up by the police in the middle of the night
        and are transported to the dock in Oslo. Unknowing and frightened men,
        women, children, sick and old are forced on board the awaiting German
        cargo ship "SS DONAU". The ship leaves with 532 Norwegian Jews onboard;
        302 men, 188 women and 42 children. The end station is
        Auschwitz.</image:caption
