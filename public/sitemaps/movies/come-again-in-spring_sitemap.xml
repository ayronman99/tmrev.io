        >This gentle tale about mortality works in subliminal ways. When an old
        man is visited by Death at his home in the meadows, he has to delve deep
        to secure more time for himself. Does he have the strength to find the
        answers he needs? Can we negotiate our time on earth? How do we
        reconcile our mortal fate? A lyrical look at a reality as old as
        humanity, yet as young as today. Based on a story by Richard
        Kennedy.</image:caption
