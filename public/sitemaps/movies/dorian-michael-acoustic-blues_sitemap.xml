        >Joined by two legendary guitarists Albert Lee and Laurence Juber,
        Dorian Michael is an accomplished soloist in his own right, having
        released 10 records over the past 25 years. On this recording he
        explores the blues with an ensemble consisting of guitars, bass, piano
        and drums. An all acoustic, high definition recording, the tracks on
        this DVD demonstrate the ultimate in sonic fidelity combined with
        terrific musicianship and well-crafted tunes. This DVD-Audio/Video was
        revently named one of the 'top acoustics guitar albums' and was selected
        as a Stereophile Magazine 'Record to Die For' by Kalman Rubinson in
        2004, the only DVD-Audio disc to make the list. Guitarists and
        audiophile have raved about the 'in your living room' sound and energy
        of this AIX Records release.</image:caption
