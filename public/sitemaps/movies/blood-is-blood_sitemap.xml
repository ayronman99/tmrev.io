        >For siblings Brie, Daniel, Crew, and Jess, family has always come
        first. But when Crew (Daniel DiTomasso) invites his girlfriend Sara
        (Kate French) into the family, distrust begins to bubble between the
        siblings. Seeing Sara as a threat, Brie (Fiona Dourif) grows spiteful
        and increasingly suspicious that she is being replaced. That is, until
        the night Crew attempts to murder her in their family house.
        Traumatized, Brie is sent to a mental facility where she is tormented by
        hallucinations of Crew from the night of the attack. But when the
        visions begin to bleed into reality, Brie starts to fear that it’s not
        just her sanity that’s in danger, and she flees the facility. In a
        frantic attempt to return to her remaining siblings and warn them, Brie
        begins to uncover a trail of gory, sinister secrets that lead her to
        believe that she might not know her family as well as she
        thought.</image:caption
