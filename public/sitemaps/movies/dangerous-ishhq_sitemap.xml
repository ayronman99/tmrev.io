        >Supermodel Sanjana and Rohan, son of one of the nation's foremost
        business tycoons have been one of the most popular couples in the social
        circuit. When Sanjana decides against flying to Paris at the last
        minute- for a lucrative modeling assignment, she does so, not just
        because she cannot bear to stay away from her boyfriend Rohan, but more
        importantly because her instincts push her against going. But what her
        instincts cannot do is stop Rohan from getting kidnapped. The high
        profile kidnapping creates chaos in Sanjana's life. The kidnappers
        demand INR 50 crores. The Police however believe that even paying the
        ransom will not bring Rohan back.</image:caption
