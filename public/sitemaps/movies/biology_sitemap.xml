        >A small town shortly before the end of the GDR: 15-year-old Ulla lives
        with her mother in a dilapidated old building where not even the
        electricity works properly. Economy of scarcity and national bankruptcy
        are visible everywhere. Only higher party comrades live in the lap of
        luxury. When Ulla meets Winfried after a summer bathing trip, the two
        fall in love. Winfried is the son of an influential general director and
        owns things from West Germany that others only dream of: a computer, a
        games console, a walkman. On an excursion with her biology class, the
        high school student discovers that a dacha is being built in the middle
        of the nature reserve and the creek has been dammed. Winfried's father
        turns out to be the culprit, but the mayor is on his side. Ulla rebels
        against this environmental destruction connected to political corruption
        and organizes a protest. Her activism not only endangers her own future,
        but also her first great love.</image:caption
