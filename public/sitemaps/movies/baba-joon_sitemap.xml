        >Yitzhak runs the turkey farm his father built with his own two hands
        after they emigrated from Iran to Israel. When his son Moti turns
        thirteen, Yitzhak teaches him the trade, hoping that he will continue
        the proud family tradition. But Moti doesn't like working in the turkey
        barn; his passion is fixing up junkyard cars and bringing them back to
        life. Moti's mother Sarah tries to reconcile between the two, while his
        grandfather pushes Yitzhak to take a firm hand with his son. Yitzhak
        takes Moti's refusal to work in the turkey barn as a personal rejection.
        Though he loves his son dearly, he makes it his mission to impose the
        family farm on Moti. The arrival of Darius, the uncle from America, sets
        off a chain of events that will undermine the familial harmony. Soon
        enough Yitzhak will learn that his son is just as stubborn as he is. The
        conflict is inevitable.</image:caption
