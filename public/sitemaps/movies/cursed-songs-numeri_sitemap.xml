        >There's something wrong at the Pacific Institute...something wrong and
        evil. For young Mari, whose family has worked in the finishing industry
        for generations, her studies in advanced genetics and marine
        bio-engineering represent not just her own future, but that of her
        entire family. But when her friend Nanako is mysteriously discovered
        dead, Mari's dreams turn into her worst nightmares! Because not only was
        Nanako's body covered with fishbites, she was also growing scales! Now,
        as a new wave of deaths and tragedies engulf the Pacific team, it
        becomes all too clear that someone....something...has a new future in
        mind for all human kind. For centuries man has taken from the ocean,
        never dreaming what might lurk beneath the waves; now the revelation has
        begun...and this time, we're the sushi!</image:caption
