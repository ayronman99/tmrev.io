        >About Baghdad is the first film made about Iraq after the fall of the
        Ba'ath regime in July 2003. It is also perhaps the first effort to
        privilege the voices of the Iraqi people, from all walks of life as well
        as social, economic and ethnic backgrounds. While many have talked about
        and for the Iraqi people, few media outlets have sought to probe beyond
        the simplistic binary of pro-US/pro-Saddam perspective so often found in
        Western and Arab media portrayals of Iraq. About Baghdad presents Iraqis
        who describe the pain, complexity and suffering of living under decades
        of tyranny, oppression, wars, sanctions and now
        occupation.</image:caption
