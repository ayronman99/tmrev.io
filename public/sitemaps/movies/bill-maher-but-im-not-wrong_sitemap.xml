        >In front of a live audience at the Raleigh Memorial Auditorium at the
        Progress Energy Center for the Performing Arts in Raleigh, North
        Carolina, the Emmy-nominated host of Real Time with Bill Maher performs
        an all-new hour of stand-up comedy. Among the topics Bill discusses in
        his ninth HBO solo special are: Whether the "Great Recession" is really
        over; the fake patriotism of the right wing; what goes on in the mind of
        a terrorist; why Obama needs a posse instead of the secret service; the
        drug war; Michael Jackson; getting out of Iraq and Afghanistan; racism;
        the Teabagger movement; religion; the health-care fight; why Gov. Mark
        Sanford will come out looking good, and how silly it is to ask "Why do
        men cheat?"; and why comedy most definitely didn't die when George Bush
        left office.</image:caption
