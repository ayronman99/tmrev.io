        >When the new principal of Somchai-Saisamorn School decides to separate
        the school into two sex-segregated institutions, most of the teachers
        and students were in disagreement with his policy. The new executive
        committee offers them the chance to bring fame and fortune to the school
        within the new first semester otherwise the new policy will become
        effective immediately. Unfortunately, the situation worsens when the new
        committee finds out about the "Zaa Club" party, and orders it to end.
        They fire Dong, the head of the club, in an attempt to quash the party.
        But whether the club's members can do anything to stop the committee and
        their killjoy policies remains to be seen.</image:caption
