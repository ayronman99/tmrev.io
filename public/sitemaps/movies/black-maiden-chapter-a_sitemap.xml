        >Orphan girl Mei is adopted by a wealthy family and receives the ticket
        out of the orphanage. The girl finds herself with a sister who has
        arrived at the family under similar circumstances. They bond and become
        close. Things take a turn for the worse, however, when the family's
        fortunes take a nosedive allowing the family to keep no more than one of
        the girls. That means someone has to trod back to the orphanage. Well,
        neither is volunteering.</image:caption
