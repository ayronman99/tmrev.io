        >East Side Story takes place in Harlem where there's a mix of ball
        players, hustlers, street rappers and even those who dream of making a
        difference. But deep in the midst of this community, lies a thriving
        drug world and one man named Moe who wants to own it all. With the help
        of his crew and the approval of local thugs, Moe eventually finds
        himself on top of Harlem's toughest drug scene. But when things start to
        get more violent and real than he ever imagined, Moe is faced with a
        choice, either change his life or sell his soul.</image:caption
