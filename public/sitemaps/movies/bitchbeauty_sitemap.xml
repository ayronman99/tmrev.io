        >Bitch-Beauty is an experimental documentary paralleling the lives of
        Anne Hanavan, whose experiences as part of the underground scene in the
        East Village of the 1980s was contemporary with now-deceased actress Zoe
        Tamerlis Lund, the actor and screenwriter of Bad Lieutenant, who died of
        a heroin/cocaine overdose in 1999. Using Hanavan's films, performances,
        readings, and music as well as footage from Lund's work, Bitch-Beauty is
        an intense seven-minute time capsule of addiction, the perils of street
        prostitution, and subsequent renewal or revival through cathartic
        self-expression.</image:caption
