        >How far would you go to confront the demons of your past? After
        twenty-something Joe plays a seemingly innocent drinking game at a
        party, he suffers a sudden violent blackout that awakens something
        sinister within. Much to his horror, they become more frequent in the
        coming days and bring with them visions of mind-numbing terror. As Joe
        questions his diminishing sanity, he is met with increasing physical
        pain that spawns balls of bloodstained flesh from his very body. He must
        trace his forgotten childhood to learn the savage truth that left him in
        an orphanage and why now it has returned to haunt him.</image:caption
