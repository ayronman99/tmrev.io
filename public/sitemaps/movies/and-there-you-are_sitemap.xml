        >Ray Dalton [Roy Kirkland] is a successful businessman, snappy dresser,
        drives a Lexus on 22s and never meets a stranger, but love seems to be
        the hardest object to acquire. Ray gets lots of advice from relatives,
        friends and even professionals, but continues his search for the one
        right man. You see, Ray only dates straight guys who, unfortunately for
        Ray, all have girlfriends, which get in the way. This quirky slice of
        life comedy, based on actual events, is packed with great characters,
        sexy men and even a few girls. There s always another man around the
        next corner, and Ray turns lots of corners!</image:caption
