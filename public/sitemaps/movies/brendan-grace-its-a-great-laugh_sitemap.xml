        >Comedy performance from popular Irish stand-up Brendan Grace. Grace,
        now celebrating 40 years as an entertainer, was originally a musician,
        but when his band was struggling in the face of a hostile crowd he took
        to the stage solo and found his true vocation. He has since become known
        for his character sketches and humorous take on everyday
        life.</image:caption
