        >Few intellectuals have experienced as much admiration and hatred as
        Antonio Negri. His international best-selling book, Empire, a critical
        analysis of the new global economy coauthored with Michael Hardt, was
        hailed as a new manifesto for the 21st century, and turned Negri into a
        leading spokesperson for the international anti-globalization movement.
        Antonio Negri: A Revolt that Never Ends profiles the controversial life
        and times of this important moral and political philosopher, militant,
        prisoner, refugee, and so-called "enemy of the state." It traces his
        roots in the radical left-wing movements in Italy during the 60s and
        70s, illustrated through incredible archival footage of strikes, factory
        occupations, terrorist actions, violent street confrontations, and
        government trials of dissidents. During these tumultuous decades Negri
        spent ten years in prison and fourteen years in Parisian exile, where he
        contributed to philosophical debates with authors such as Gilles
        Deleuze.</image:caption
