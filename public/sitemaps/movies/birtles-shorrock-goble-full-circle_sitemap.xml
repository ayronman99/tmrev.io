        >Since reforming, Birtles Shorrock Goble have released a major live DVD
        and CD. Recorded over two nights at The Forum in Melbourne, Australia,
        before packed houses, Full Circle showcased all of the hits made famous
        by the singers and songwriters of Little River Band, together with album
        tracks performed during a mid-concert acoustic set. New songs written by
        each of the members were also introduced. Full Circle was produced by
        Birtles Shorrock Goble manager Paul Rodger and mixed by longtime
        supporter and friend Michael Costa at Stream AV Studios in
        Melbourne.</image:caption
