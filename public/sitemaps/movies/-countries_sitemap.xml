        >Ullaas is a cunning guy who can go to any extent for money. One fine
        day, he cheats a priest and redirects an NRI match which is supposed to
        go to a known person in his village. He manages everything and finally
        ties the knot with Laya. The twist in the tale arises when Ullaas comes
        to know that the NRI girl he married is a complete alcoholic. Rest of
        the story is as to how Sunil manages to get his problematic wife back on
