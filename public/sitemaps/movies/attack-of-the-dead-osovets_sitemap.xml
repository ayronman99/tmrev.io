        >August 6, 1915. After several unsuccessful attempts to assault the
        positions of the Russian army, the command of the German troops is
        decided on a new one. On the eve of the attack on the position of the
        Germans deliver cylinders with chlorine. Lieutenant Kotlinsky
        accidentally learns about the upcoming use of chemical weapons, but he
        does not have the time and opportunity to protect his people. All that
        remains for him is to set up a company to fight to the
        last.</image:caption
