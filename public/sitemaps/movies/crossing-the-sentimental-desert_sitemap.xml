        >It's the summer of 1993, six months since the death of Wang's wife,
        Chuen-Ying. His son, Chi-Shiung, has just come home from Taipei in order
        to take care of his father's Baozi (steamed buns with stuffing)
        business. Although he didn't want to take over his father's store, Wang
        insisted he wanted to keep it. Chi-Shiung suggested to his father that
        he hire some extra staff and so Ying, a Vietnam woman, is hired. In the
        mean-time Wang can't get over Chuen-Ying's death and begins to burden
        Ying. â€”Jean Huang</image:caption
