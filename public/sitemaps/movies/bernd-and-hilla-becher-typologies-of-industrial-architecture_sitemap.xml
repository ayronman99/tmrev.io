        >Working together as photographers since 1957, Bernd and Hilla Becher
        have become known for capturing endangered architecture quickly
        vanishing from the modern landscape. By the end of the 1960's they were
        part of the conceptual art movement in view of their minimalist
        approach. "Bernd and Hilla Becher: 4 Decades" follows the couple through
        their retrospective exhibition at Berlin's Hamburger Bahnhof Museum
        while they discuss their beginnings as documentarians of 19th century
        industrial architecture.</image:caption
