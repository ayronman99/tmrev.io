        >Ah Lok Kafe is a trendy little place in Kuala Lumpur and is a
        family-run business currently owned by Tan Ah Lok, who happens to be a
        die-hard Elvis Presley fan. The Kafe is a popular place frequented by
        Malaysians from all walks of life and even offers a karaoke lounge for
        punters. Ah Lok however, runs into some financial trouble when his
        daughter Ai Ling is diagnosed with a rare heart disease. In order to pay
        for his daughter’s treatment, Ah Lok’s only choice is to sell his cafe
        to a shady contractor who plans to demolish the building to make way for
        a condominium project. So, does this spell the end of Ah Lok
        Kafe?</image:caption
