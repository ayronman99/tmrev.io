        >At the heart of the plot lies a conflict between a young woman and a
        bank employee over some hidden clauses in a mortgage deal. The 25-year
        old young woman is married and works as manager; she is paying off a
        long-term mortgage. One day she finds out that she has an incurable
        disease and that her husband, an airline steward, has perished in an air
        crash. The insurance sum is sufficient to cover the mortgage in one lump
        sum... An allusion to people trading the best years of their life for an
        apartment, only in this case the trade is literally between an apartment
        and life.</image:caption
