        >After he and his wife are murdered, marine Ray Garrison is resurrected
        by a team of scientists. Enhanced with nanotechnology, he becomes a
        superhuman, biotech killing machineâ€”'Bloodshot'. As Ray first trains
        with fellow super-soldiers, he cannot recall anything from his former
        life. But when his memories flood back and he remembers the man that
        killed both him and his wife, he breaks out of the facility to get
        revenge, only to discover that there's more to the conspiracy than he
        thought.</image:caption
