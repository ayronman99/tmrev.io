        >A Malay remake of Jack Neo's 2002 hit "I Not Stupid Too" directed by
        Boris Boo. A 16-year-old boy named Roy who is stuck with a dysfunctional
        family. Both of his parents are two busy working adults who, in pursuit
        of luxury, with the thinking that fiscal and material things are the
        only necessities their children would ever need, had neglected the
        emotional needs of Roy and his younger brother, Jefri in the process.
        Follow Roy's misadventures as he copes with pre-adolescence, depression
        and even joining a small group of gangsters as means of fulfilling the
        void left by his problematic home situation and finding his true
        self.</image:caption
