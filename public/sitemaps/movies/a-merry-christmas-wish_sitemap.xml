        >Janie, a rising marketing executive living in The Big Apple, returns to
        her hometown of Woodland Falls when her Great-Uncle Randall passes away.
        Randall has even arranged for his farmhand, Dylan to help at the event,
        which is being held in the farmâ€™s sprawling barn. Aware that her
        Manhattan boyfriend is anxious for her to return to the city so the pair
        can jet off to a previously planned holiday on the beach, Janie begins
        to feel an unexpected emotional tug about living life in a more
        authentic, meaningful way.</image:caption
