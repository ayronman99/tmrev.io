        >Raymond Weir is a shut in computer genius surviving in the post dot-com
        era. Disabled as a result of a home invasion that took the life of his
        late wife, Sarah, Raymond sits in his makeshift apartment above a run
        down bar, over medicated, mourning her loss and contemplating suicide.
        His only contact with the world, besides his close friend Paul are the
        three computer screens that blink emotionlessly at him twenty four hours
        a day, through sleepless nights. There, he sees the universe, filled
        with images of webcams around the world, from petty crimes and private
        confessions, to public tragedies and natural disasters. It is here, one
        night, as Raymond finishes piecing together an old video recording of
        his late wife, that he sees a mysterious woman, Layla. The image of her
        is unexpected, sexual, as she goes through a ritualistic set of gestures
        that leads to an emotional plea to Raymond</image:caption
