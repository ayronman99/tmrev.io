        >A young Cambodian man who has been trained to fight for money in his
        country is hired to kill someone in Hong Kong. He performs the hit and
        then flees from Hong Kong police, who are wrestling with internal
        problems of a model cop and his son, who is also on the force and who
        was told by his dad not to become a police officer. The father goes into
        a coma after being shot, and internal affairs suspects him of dealing
        drugs on the side. The assassin then befriends a young girl who is
        molested and abused by her father. They both plan to get back on a ship
        to Cambodia but have to get past Hong Kong police, who do everything
        they can to catch him.</image:caption
