        >Kazman is a dedicated husband who, despite his wife Sufiah's protests,
        decided to buy a bungalow for their family near a lake as a family
        getaway. Anxious in the new house, Sufiah feels as if someone is
        watching her. Her daughter Lisa, who would always go downstairs at night
        to play congkak with someone whom she could only see, compounds her
        uneasiness. Sufiah throws the congkak in the lake, but is awakened the
        next night by the sound of the congkak being played again and upon
        investigation, she sees an old lady playing it. When her daughter
        disappears, the oldest resident in that area, Pak Tua, comes to the
        family's rescue and helps in locating the missing family
        members.</image:caption
