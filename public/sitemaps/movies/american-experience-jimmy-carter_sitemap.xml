        >Jimmy Carter ran for president on a wave of post-Watergate disaffection
        with Washington politics. But inexperience, inflation, recession, and
        the Iran hostage crisis, derailed his presidency dramatically. His
        crowning achievement, the Camp David Accords, created a framework for
        Middle East peace, inspiring his life since. The film traces his ascent
        from Plains, Georgia, to the Oval Office and explores the role of
        religion in his career. This is the first of two parts.</image:caption
