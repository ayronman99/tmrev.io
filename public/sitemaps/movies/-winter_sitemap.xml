        >Based on one of the most spectacular series of bank robberies in
        Germany, Zw√∂lf Winter tells the story of Klaus and Mike, two criminals
        who became friends in prison. When they happen to meet each other again
        after they have been released they begin to plan the perfect bank
        robbery, and it seems to work. For twelve years the two keep on robbing
        banks, always in winter. The police are in the dark for years. But they
        won't stick to their guns...</image:caption
