        >Pharmaceutical student, Keiko witnesses her boyfriend having an affair.
        Shocked and disappointed, she jumps on a train ("destination anywhere,
        east or west, she don't care") and ends up in a town named Masao in
        Tokyo's remote suburbs. There, she gets a part-time job at a newly
        opened drugstore. What do ya know.. The local shopping district's
        middle-aged men all fall for the young girl's charms, and they start
        practicing lacrosse once they have found out that that's her favourite
        sport.</image:caption
