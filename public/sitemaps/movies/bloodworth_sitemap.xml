        >E.F. Bloodworth has returned to his home - a forgotten corner of
        Tennessee - after forty years of roaming. The wife he walked out on has
        withered and faded, his three sons are grown and angry. Warren is a
        womanizing alcoholic, Boyd is driven by jealousy to hunt down his wife
        and her lover, and Brady puts hexes on his enemies from his mamma's
        porch. Only Fleming, the old man's grandson, treats him with the respect
        his age commands, and sees past all the hatred to realize the way it can
        poison a man's soul. It is ultimately the love of Raven Lee, a sloe-eyed
        beauty from another town, that gives Fleming the courage to reject this
        family curse.</image:caption
