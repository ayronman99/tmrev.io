        >Hoshino (Toshiro Yanagiba) is the mob-connected owner of a ritzy
        Chinese restaurant. One evening he’s sitting down in a lavishly
        appointed private room to enjoy an elaborate multicourse dinner, when he
        gets a call from a crooked politician of his acquaintance. A
        long-meditated money-laundering deal is about to bear fruit and earn him
        a cool 5 billion yen. The gang boss who backed him on this deal will be
        pleased. He is, understandably, in the mood for celebrating when an
        unexpected visitor (Izam) arrives — a tall, husky, mincing fellow in
        dreadlocks, with a gun. He is a hit man sent to whack Hoshino — but for
        what? The hit man neither explains nor kills; instead he sits down at
        the table and asks Hoshino when dinner is going to be served. Coolly,
        Hoshino calls in Chinese for the waitress, who enters, wearing a red,
        slit dress and an inscrutable expression, with the first course. The
        longest meal of Hoshino’s life has just begun.</image:caption
