        >Neil Lawrence is sent to a boarding school by his father. During the
        first days he meets T.J. who he falls in love with. After being assigned
        a paper on Holden Caulfield - the main character in J.D. Salinger's "The
        Catcher in the Rye" - Neil decides to go on a journey to meet Salinger,
        who he feels has played a huge role in his life. Neil & T.J. take off on
        a journey to New York City. A journey that leads to more then they both
        ever could have imagined - and changes both their lives
        forever.</image:caption
