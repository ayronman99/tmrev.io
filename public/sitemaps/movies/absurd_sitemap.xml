        >David is a young man who lives his life by the philosophy of absurdism,
        which is the belief that humans have no purpose. David's world changes
        when he attends the comedy show of a female comic, Valerie, who touches
        on grim topics such as sexual assault and drug abuse. After the show, he
        puts it in his mind that he needs to "save" her by showing her
        compassion and being someone who will protect her; this act of "saving"
        being what he needs to create meaning in his life. All the while,
        David's friends are going through their own existential crises, but
        without the same amount of self-awareness and/or irrationality. Donald,
        the failing comedian, Chelsea, David's neglected girlfriend, Lydia, the
        sexually frustrated nag, and Kevin, the God-fearing idealist, struggle
        to keep their own lives together while trying to figure out what is
        wrong with David.</image:caption
