        >An adaptation of the 1886 musical “Alice in Wonderland: A Dream Play
        for Children” by Henry Saville Clark and Walter Slaughter, Fotopoulos’
        feature length film propels the Clark/Slaughter score into the 21st
        century digital age. Sculptures, drawings, text, and original music are
        used to explore the late 19th century’s evolution of painting,
        literature, and theatre into early photography and moving pictures. The
        piece probes the interplay of art and science and in exploring these
        ideas certain lives and themes are touched upon – the relationship
        between John Ruskin and Lewis Carroll, Ruskin’s theories on drawing,
        Thomas Eakins’ painting and his use of photography, the burgeoning of
        early cinema with Eadweard Muybridge and Etienne-Jules Marey, notions of
        amateurism and professionalism in art and the archetype of the condemned
        artist. The work is presented in two acts, remaining faithful to the
        musical’s original construction based upon Carroll’s
        narratives.</image:caption
