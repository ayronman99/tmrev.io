        >Joy Holbrook, is a corporate market researcher, gunning for a promotion
        within her firm. Just as her company's CEO is taking notice, Joy finds
        out her Aunt Ruby has broken her ankle and will be undergoing surgery.
        Despite the less than opportune timing, Joy makes her way back home to
        Crystal Falls, NC to be with her Aunt. Stars seem to be aligned as Joy
        sees her former crush, Ben Andrews, while at the hospital. At first, Joy
        is focused solely on helping her Aunt heal; even taking over her
        position as chair of the local Cookie Crawl competition. Eventually, she
        begins to let Ben in and remembers there's no place like home for the
        holidays. The pair work together on the Cookie Crawl to make the event a
        success.</image:caption
