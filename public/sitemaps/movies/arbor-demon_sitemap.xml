        >An adventurous woman with a secret from her husband insists they go for
        a romantic camping trip in a remote wood to reconnect and share some
        quality time. But their idyll is shockingly cut short after a group of
        nearby hunters are brutally killed by a mysterious creature. Trapped
        inside their tent, the couple is forced to help one of the injured
        hunters and together they plan their escape. Is there really something
        supernatural hidden in the forest? Or is it just their imaginations
        running riot. Soon they must determine if the real threat is inside or
        outside their enclosure</image:caption
