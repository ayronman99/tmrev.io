        >Hard-hearted New York novelist Dru Cassadine...known for her holiday
        romance stories (even though she is antilove and anti-Christmas)...is
        desperate to get her mojo back after a string of flops (and a
        not-so-subtle threat by her publisher that he'll drop her if she has
        another failure). She decides that a change of scenery might get her
        creative juices flowing and heads south for the winter, landing in a
        place known as Harbor Pointe. She doesn't quite get what she came for.
        She gets much more.</image:caption
