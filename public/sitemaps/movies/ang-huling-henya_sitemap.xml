        >Miri is trapped in her past and this time her whole past comes crashing
        back into her life: old dead secrets, her dead parents, and even the
        walking dead. Miris return to Manila only brings her back to more
        trouble the personal kind. Even as a young girl, Miri believed she is
        responsible for her parents death and the guilt kept her from building
        healthy relationships with those around her specially with her younger
        brother Mark. Miri Alvarez, is one of the best agents of an
        international group organized to protect scientists and inventors from a
        tech-grabbing group called The Agency. But Miri is hot headed and
        refuses to follow orders. In one rescue operation, Miris refusal to
        follow protocol gets her long-time partner killed. Miri is suspended and
        sent back to Manila.</image:caption
