        >On March 30, 1997, the Miike Coal Mine, the largest mine in Japan,
        ceased operations. The burden of its history, however, is still being
        borne by many: a chronicle of prisoners used in the mine, forced labor,
        strikes, and coal dust explosions. This documentary is the first to
        directly confront the legacy of the Miike Mine, reviving through
        eyewitness testimonies a history of struggle lasting 150 years that
        modern Japan is trying to forget. It took seven years to complete,
        interviewing over 70 individuals, from the men and women who signed up
        to do this backbreaking work and lived in pride by the mountain, to the
        Koreans who were forcibly brought to Japan and made to work down the
        shaft. The director Hiroko Kumagai hopes that we look at Miike not just
        to explore the past, but also to think about the future: what it means
        to work and to live courageously.</image:caption
