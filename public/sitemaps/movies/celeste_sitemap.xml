        >Celeste is a renowned opera diva who retired early for the man she
        loved to live on a crumbling and beautiful estate in the heart of a
        rainforest in Far North Queensland. Ten years after the tragic death of
        her husband, Mateos, in a boating accident, Celeste is set to return to
        the stage for her final performance. Her husband’s son Jack, still
        haunted by the past, arrives amidst the preparations for the performance
        and finds Celeste is as he remembered – beautiful, intoxicating and
        dangerous. Celeste wants Jack to stay at the estate, but needs him to
        perform one last request.</image:caption
