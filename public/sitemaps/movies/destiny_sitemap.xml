        >In the 12th century's Andalusia lives Ibn Rushd a prominent islamic
        philosopher with his wife Zeinab and daughter Salma. The principality is
        ruled by Khalifa ElMansour who has two sons, ElNasser, an intellectual
        that likes Ibn Rush and is in love with his daughter Salma. The younger
        son Abdallah is more into dancing and poetry, spending most of his times
        with the gypsy family and getting the daughter pregnant. The Khalifa is
        depending on the extremists to build his army granting them more power
        which they use to combat artists and philosophers. The extremists
        succeed in recruiting Abd Allah and train him to kill his father. Events
        go on where Marawan, the gypsy singer, is killed and Ibn Rushd's books
        are burnt. Adapted from the real life of Ibn Rushd AlMasir is Chahine's
        statement against extremism.</image:caption
