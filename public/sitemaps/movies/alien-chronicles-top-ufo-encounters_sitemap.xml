        >Aliens and UFOs are more real than ever before. Thousands of sightings
        by highly credible witnesses worldwide cannot be denied. The big
        question is not whether the Aliens are here among us, monitoring us,
        perhaps preparing us for some kind of end game that will change humanity
        forever, but why is the government and military still denying the fact
        that we are not alone? While many of the sightings every year are
        debunked, it's the ones that defy description, obliterate our notions of
        physics and science and exhibit other worldly capabilities beyond our
        grasp. The mind blowingly bizarre and most mysterious Alien Encounters
        of all, these are the cases we call Alien Chronicles.</image:caption
