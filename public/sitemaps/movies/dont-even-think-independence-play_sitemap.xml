        >This story is about three slacker friends: Marat (a video store
        worker); Belyj (an unsuccessful actor); and Nick (a cowardly marshal
        arts practitioner). Bored with their lives and wanting to instead live
        in style, the boys rob the richest and most respected men in the city.
        However, they are in over their heads and it is too late to turn
        back.</image:caption
