        >ALL KINDSA GIRLS traces the evolution of garage/punk rock from its
        inception in the sixties through current interpretations. Focusing on
        the career of singer/songwriter John Felice and his band the Real Kids,
        the film examines the significance of music in the lives of performers
        and fans. In 1976, the year the Ramones and the Sex Pistols issued their
        first albums, ex-Modern Lover John Felice put together the band that
        would become the Real Kids. One year later, they recorded the
        garage/punk classic known as the Red Star Album. ALL KINDSA GIRLS
        documents Felice's evolving search for success</image:caption
