        >Love in a Brazilian town on the edge of the jungle: he loves her, and
        she says she loves him too. She deserves a gift, one that makes an
        impression. He wants to marry her and can’t wait any longer. So he heads
        out into the jungle armed with a pickaxe, since there is no app to find
        what he has in mind for her: gemstones. Gemstones are the path to
        freedom, his way out of the dreary small town – with her at his
        side.</image:caption
