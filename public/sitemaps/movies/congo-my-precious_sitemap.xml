        >The Democratic Republic of Congo in Africa is one of the world’s most
        resource-rich countries. A wide range of rare minerals can be found here
        in abundance, all commanding high prices in world commodity markets.
        Diamonds for jewellery, tantalum, tungsten and gold for electronics;
        uranium used in power generation and weaponry and many others. Congo has
        copious deposits of raw materials that are in high demand
        internationally but remains one of the poorest countries in the world.
        For our translator, Bernard Kalume Buleri, his country’s history of
        turmoil is very personal; like most Congolese people, he and his family
        fell victim to the unending mineral based power struggle. Born in the
        year of his country’s independence, he has lived through war and seen
        his homeland torn apart by violent looting and greed. His story is a
        damning testament, illustrating how nature’s bounty, instead of being a
        blessing, becomes a deadly curse.</image:caption
