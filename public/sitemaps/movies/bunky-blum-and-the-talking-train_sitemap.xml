        >Bunky Blum is picked on in school. His only peace comes during lunch
        hour, when he and his mentally ill Mother eat McDonalds and visit a
        talking train named Train. The 83 year-old train is now a caged monument
        in the center of a children's park. However, Bunky believes that the
        train will break out of its confines and save him from the bullies of
        the schoolyard. When Bunky realizes that the train is not magical, all
        hope is lost and Bunky has a moral melt down. In a fit of rage, Bunky
        punches a girl in a wheelchair. The unsympathetic move lands Bunky on
        the losing end of a full out brawl. Bunky's Mother witnesses the
        schoolyard violence and she erupts into her own fit of rage, which
        ultimately sends her back to the psych ward. In the end, Bunky is left
        without hope, without family and without security. He returns to the old
        train to make a final plea for vengeance. But Bunky's giant steal savior
        has not come for vengeance. Rather, it offers Bunky what he needs, a
        shush of peace.</image:caption
