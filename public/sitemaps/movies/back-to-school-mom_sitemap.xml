        >Mary Thomas, a free-spirited musician, has spent the past two decades
        traveling the world, but at age 41 she decides to go back to college and
        finish her degree so that, for once, she can finally finish something
        she started. Back at her old university, she becomes close friends with
        her popular and charming "peer tutor" -- only to learn that he is
        actually the son she gave up 20 years earlier.</image:caption
