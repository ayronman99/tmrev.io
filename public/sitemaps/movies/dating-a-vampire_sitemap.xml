        >Eric (Alex Fong Lik-Sun) and Cheun (Sammy) are two medical students who
        opt to rent a flat in a secluded housing estate, the reason being to
        concentrate on their upcoming exams. Their best intentions go south damn
        quick; first of all, Cheun wastes time and acts extremely annoying,
        thereby ruining any chance at serious study time. Second, there may be
        vampires in the building. Eric becomes slightly enamored of Jade (Miki
        Lee), a pretty young thing who lives in the building with her older
        sisters (Zuki Lee and Cynthia Ho). But after a series of weird noises
        and the appearance of a man bleeding from the neck, Eric thinks
        something may be up. He enlists the help of TV occult expert Mister M
        (Yuen Wah), who all but confirms Eric's suspicions: the sisters are
        vampires. Worse, they must suck the life out of one good man to cure
        their aversion to daylight, and have ear-marked Eric as the designated
        \"good man\".</image:caption
