        >When Charles Darwin published his theory of evolution nearly 150 years
        ago, he shattered the dominant belief of his day â€“ that humans were the
        product of divine creation. Through his observations of nature, Darwin
        proposed the theory of evolution by natural selection. This caused
        uproar. After all, if the story of creation could be doubted, so too
        could the existence of the creator. Ever since its proposal, this
        cornerstone of biology has sustained wave after wave of attack. Now some
        scientists fear it is facing the most formidable challenge yet: a
        controversial new theory called intelligent design.</image:caption
