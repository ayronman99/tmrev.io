        >Talented swimmer, motivated apprentice, cool buddy: Beyto is in the
        midst of life. But when the only son of a Turkish migrant family falls
        in love with his coach Mike, an ideal world falls to pieces. His parents
        only see one way out: They lure him to their home village and plan his
        wedding with Seher, his childhood friend. Suddenly, Beyto finds himself
        in a disruptive love triangle. A subtle, summerly sensuous love story
        about three young people by Gitta Gsell.</image:caption
