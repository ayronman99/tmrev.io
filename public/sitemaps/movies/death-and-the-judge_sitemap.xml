        >The documentary, " Death and the Judge", revolves around Iran's most
        famous criminal judge, Azizmohammadi. He served as a criminal judge for
        45 years and issued about 4500 death sentences; a record in not only
        Iran, but also the world. This documentary looks into his personal and
        professional life as he is followed within his home with his family, in
        the court of law, and in his retirement days. The ultimate purpose of
        the documentary is to deduce the role of death in the judge's life as he
        either takes life away from criminals or death comes to his loved ones.
        During his retirement, he is once again given the choice between the
        life and death of a person, despite no longer being a
        judge.</image:caption
