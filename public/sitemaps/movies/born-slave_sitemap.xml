        >“Born slave” is the first film ever made about the slavery in
        Mauritania. The swedish filmmakers succeeded in entering Mauritania “as
        tourists” and secretly filming the slavery. Mauritania is the only
        country in the world where a slave class still exists. Humans are owned
        by a slave master and are forced to work without any compensation. The
        children are separated from their mothers at the age of one and are
        brought up as slaves. The film is screened throughout the world. For
        example in South Africa in Cape Town and Johannesburg, at several
        universities, schools and different Township communities. “Born slave”
        caused commotion when it was screened in Washington, USA. Agents from
        the Mauritanian embassy showed up and after some disturbance, security
        personel had to turn away the embassy agents. Amnesty International use
        the film in their activity.</image:caption
