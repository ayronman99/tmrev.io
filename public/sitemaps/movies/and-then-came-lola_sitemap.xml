        >A talented, but distracted photographer, Lola, on the verge of success
        in both love and work, could lose it all if she doesn't make it to a
        crucial meeting on time. But, as usual, Lola is late. With her job and
        girlfriend on the line, she has three chances to make it right. In a
        desperate race through the streets and back rooms of San Francisco, time
        grows short-will Lola make it? Will she come at all? With a pop
        sensibility that mixes live action, animation and still photography, And
        Then Came Lola explores love's age old question in a fresh new way, "If
        you try, try again, will you finally get it right?" (Written by M. Siler
        and E. Seidler)</image:caption
