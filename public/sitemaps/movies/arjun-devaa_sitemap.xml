        >Arjun Poojari lives in a small village in Central India with his mom,
        dad, & an unmarried sister. The entire village is grateful to Bade
        Thakur Jagawar Choudhry for all the work he has done for the village.
        Then one day Arjun finds out that Jagawar's younger brother, Vikram, had
        attempted to molest his sister. He beats him and takes him to Jagawar,
        who slaps him several times and asks him to seek forgiveness from Arjun
        and his sister. That night, Arjun is summoned to Jagawar's house and in
        his very presence, his sister is sexually assaulted by all Choudhry
        brothers, including Yogeshwar, Virendra, and Vishal. Arjun revolts and
        becomes a dreaded Dacoit - his mission: to kill all the Choudhry
        brothers at any and all costs.</image:caption
