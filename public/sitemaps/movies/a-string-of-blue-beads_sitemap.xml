        >A STRING OF BLUE BEADS is a slight little Christmas tale that was a
        pilot for an anthology series of short stories that never came to be.
        What makes this little film fascinating is it was one of the earliest
        color broadcasts on television and happily is one of the few early color
        productions for TV that can be seen in color now. Early color television
        productions seem to have had a limited color capability much like the
        early 1930's attempts at Technicolor. This actually adds to the charm of
        this little Christmas story giving in an "old time" feel.</image:caption
