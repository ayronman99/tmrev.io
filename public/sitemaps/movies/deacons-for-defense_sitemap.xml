        >Inspired by a true story, this drama is set in 1965, not long after
        passage of the Civil Rights Act. Despite the Act, the African-American
        citizens of Bogalusa are still treated like third-class citizens, their
        fundamental rights as human beings persistently trampled by the white
        power structure, in general, and the local branch of the KKK. The story
        follows the formation of local black men, particularly ex-war veterans
        who after the struggles become too overbearing organizes the group,
        "Deacons for defense", an all-black defense group dedicated to
        patrolling the black section of town and protecting its residents from
        the more violent aspects of "white backlash."</image:caption
