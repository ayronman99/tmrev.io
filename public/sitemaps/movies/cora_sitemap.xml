        >2064. Cora, a Danish woman, finds an unfinished documentary in which
        Benjamim, her Brazilian father, attempted - fifty years earlier - to
        investigate the story of his own parents: Teo, who, afflicted by
        insanity, died when he was still a child, and Elenir, a mysterious woman
        he’d barely heard of. In the course of his investigation, Benjamim
        discovers that both characters are part of a complex family puzzle,
        filled with traumas and taboos, and starts seeing himself as an
        important piece in the puzzle. The footage found in Benjamim’s
        documentary is reorganized by his daughter, Cora, in an attempt to
        understand her family’s lost past.</image:caption
