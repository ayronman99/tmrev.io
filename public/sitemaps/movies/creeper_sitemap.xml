        >Heather and her friends have some devilish fun on the social website,
        ConnectMeNet. However, their amusement has come at the expense of a
        lonely and medicated half-wit, Jerry Tobin. After goading him into
        humiliating himself on camera in various cruel acts of depravity, they
        post the clips online for the world to see in a video titled "Revenge on
        a Creeper". This ruins Jerry's meager life and he disappears without a
        trace... Fast forward a year, and the tables are now turned when Jerry
        reemerges, off the antipsychotic medication that clouded his thoughts
        and kept his demons at bay. Now the girls are forced into a nightmarish
        fight for their lives!</image:caption
