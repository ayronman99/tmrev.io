        >When dangerous mob defector Franco goes on the run and eludes the
        D.A.'s office, they turn to their secret weapon - a gorgeous and lethal
        bounty huntress who goes only by the name of J.C. With a flawless record
        and a deadly determination, J.C. hunts down Franco in record time. But
        what she doesn't expect is that Franco is holding evidence that proves
        his innocence and incriminates the very people who hired J.C. to kill
        him. Now, she must race to find the truth, and protect the man she was
        hired to catch.</image:caption
