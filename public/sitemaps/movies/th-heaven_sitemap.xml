        >Lars Kristian Gulbrandsen has made himself, his life and everything he
        is surrounded by into a living artwork. His abstract paintings are
        bought by some of the world's biggest galleries, but the local house
        wives and the bold fishermen see Lars Kristian as a nutcase, and view
        his paintings as meaningless dabs of colour and his house a chaotic
        garbage dump.</image:caption
