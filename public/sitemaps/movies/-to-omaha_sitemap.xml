        >After a heartbreaking loss to Vanderbilt in the 2014 College World
        Series Championship game, Virginia entered the 2015 season with its
        sights set on making the 1,186-mile trip back to Omaha. But a host of
        injuries and tough losses had the Cavaliers on the verge of missing the
        NCAA tournament for the first time since head coach Brian O’Connor took
        the helm in 2004. A late-season run gave Virginia renewed hope as it
        relied on the strength of the program’s culture to make one of the
        sport’s most remarkable turnarounds en route to a CWS Championship
        finals rematch with Vanderbilt and the ACC’s first College World Series
        title since 1955.</image:caption
