        >Bad Girls The Musical is an original British musical based on
        characters from the award winning and hugely popular television drama
        Bad Girls. Set in the fictional HMP Larkhall, it's the story of new
        idealistic Wing Governor Helen Stewart and her battles with the
        entrenched old guard of Officer Jim Fenner and his sidekick Sylvia
        Hollamby. It also follows the love story that develops between Helen and
        charismatic inmate Nikki Wade. Other featured characters include Shell
        Dockley and her runner Denny Blood, old-timer Noreen Biggs, The Two
        Julies and the ultimate Top Dog, King-of-Gangland's missus, Yvonne
        Atkins. A tragic death on the wing - in which Jim Fenner is implicated -
        leads to an angry protest from the women and forces Helen and Nikki to
        their opposite sides of the bars. But when it's clear that Helen stands
        to lose her job over Fenner's misdeeds, the race is on for the women to
        nail him once and for all.</image:caption
