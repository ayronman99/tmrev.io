        >This captivating documentary is the product of five years of obsessive
        filming of live concert footage, exclusive interviews, and historic
        documentation focusing on three fiercely independent music labels and
        their bands. Featuring Neurosis, ISIS, Godspeed You! Black Emperor,
        Pelican, Oxbow, Evangelista, Thee Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra,
        Cave In, and many others whose music and art found ideal homes in the
        artist-run record labels of Hydra Head, Neurot, and Constellation. These
        labels combine hard-to-define, heavy music with a visual aesthetic that
        has enraptured worldwide fans, without the need for radio or corporate
        media outlets. They uphold the legacy of treating music as an art form,
        not as a product. This film is an answer to those who question where the
        spirit of punk rock is today.</image:caption
