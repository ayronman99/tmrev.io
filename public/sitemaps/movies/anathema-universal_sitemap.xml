        >In May 2012 Anathema released Weather Systems, the most acclaimed and
        successful album of the band's celebrated career. The album scored high
        in numerous critics end of year polls around the world and cemented the
        band's reputation as one of the most exciting and progressive band
        around. Following the release of the album the band embarked on a
        lengthy tour. The European leg opened with a triumphant one-off show at
        the ancient Roman theatre of Philippopolis with the Plovdiv Philharmonic
        Orchestra in September 2012. This incredible show was documented by
        acclaimed filmmaker Lasse Hoile (Steven Wilson, Porcupine Tree, Opeth,
        Dream Theater), the stunning results of which were released as
        Universal.</image:caption
