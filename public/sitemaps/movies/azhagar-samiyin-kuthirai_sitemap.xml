        >The story is set in a village called Mallayapuram near Theni. The
        villagers believe the Rain Gods will favour them after the annual
        Thiruvizha, during which the deity is taken around the village on a
        wooden horse. They are in for a rude shock when the horse goes missing.
        At the same time, Azhagarsami, a youngster who earns his livelihood by
        ferrying loads on his horse in Aagamalai village in Periyakulam, gets
        ready for his marriage. His horse also goes missing, and his marriage is
        put on hold. Do the villagers and Azhagarsami find their respective
        horses?</image:caption
