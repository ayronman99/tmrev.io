        >Jim, the cheapest Chinese American dude in LA, has recently been left
        by his fianc√©, Katherine two weeks before their wedding on Valentine's
        Day. In order to ease his pain, he asks his long-time best friend and
        ex-con, Alex, to kill him. Alex reluctantly agrees to give Jim his wish,
        but he doesn't think its a good idea to do the job down in LA. So Jim
        and Alex begin their journey with a trip up to Jim's Aunt's cabin in the
        mountains, under the strict condition that all business is to be taken
        care of before Valentine's Day.</image:caption
