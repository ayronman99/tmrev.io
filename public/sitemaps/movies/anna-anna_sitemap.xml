        >Anna &amp; Anna is a movie about a Singaporean arts saleswoman / alpha
        female and her subdued doppelganger. Anna One (the arts saleswoman) is
        very successful in her job, and gets posted to Shanghai, where she used
        to live before. There, by a coincidence, she finds another woman who not
        only like her but IS her - Anna Two. This Anna has finished her studies,
        become a painter, and stayed with Oulang, a depressed musician - the
        life as Anna One's could have been, had she made another decision at one
        point of her life.</image:caption
