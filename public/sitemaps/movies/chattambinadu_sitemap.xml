        >The movie tells the story of a village called Chembattunadu in
        Chamarajanagar District on the borders of Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil
        Nadu, which is popular as Chattambinadu for the presence of several
        goons and hooligans. According to Vadival Vasu (Janardanan), it was the
        severe animosity between Mallanchira and Kattappilly families that has
        caused the arrival of several goons to the land, including him, which
        made Chattambinadu notorious. The film begins with Mallanchira
        Chandramohan's(Manoj K. Jayan) plan to sell off his mansion, to pay up
        his heavy debts.</image:caption
