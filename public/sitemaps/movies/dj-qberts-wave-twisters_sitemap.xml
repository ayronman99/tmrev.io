        >A crew of heroes is determined to save the lost arts of Hip Hop. Break
        Dancing, Graffiti, MCing, and DJing from total extinction. The lost arts
        are being oppressed throughout inner-space by lord Ook and his evil
        minions the Chinheads. The dental commander Dr. Julio Azul DDS, assumed
        to be secretary Honey Drips, Dental Hygienist/Robot Rubbish, and Grandpa
        have a series of adventures, synch'd to the music. Armed with the
        ancient relic known as the Wave Twister (a small turntable/wristwatch,
        the only weapon powerful enough to defeat the enemies), they travel to
        the far ends of inner-space for a final confrontation with the sinister
        army of oppressors.</image:caption
