        >Booba, newly arrived in the bustling metropolis (her choice of
        transportation from her far flung province, where her family owns a
        profitable fruit stand, should be seen to be believed), moves from an
        all-male dormitory (with its hole-infested bathroom door, for better
        peeping of course) where she worked the nights as a go-go dancer, to a

        eight year old, before ending up as the police's top secret
        agent.</image:caption
