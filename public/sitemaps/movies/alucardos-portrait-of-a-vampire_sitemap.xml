        >Terror, transsexualism, and an eternal cult film. What is on the mind
        of horror film director Juan LÃ³pez Moctezuma and his fans, Manolo and
        Lalo, who are not only obsessed with the Mexican horror film 'Alucarda',
        but also believe in their hearts that they are its true characters?
        After finding the director in a psychiatric hospital, they kidnap him to
        make him remember his gloriously twisted past. An unclassifiable
        documentary film that uses interviews, stock shots and recreations of a
        past that may only have existed in the nightmares of its
        protagonists.</image:caption
