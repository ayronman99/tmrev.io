        >Documentary about internationally-renowned author Ariel Dorfman, the
        third generation of his family to know exile. His father's leftwing
        beliefs saw the family uprooted from both Argentina and the US, before
        settling in Chile. When Allende came to power, Ariel was a prominent
        member of his circle, but the bloody 1973 coup saw many of his friends
        and colleagues killed or disappeared and Ariel forced into exile again.
        Peter Raymont journeys with Ariel as he looks back on his life.
