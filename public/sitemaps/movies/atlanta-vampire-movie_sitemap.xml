        >Carmilla inadvertently infects Ron, Fang, and Corey with her vampirism.
        Unaware of their condition, these three misfit vampires' hysterical
        misadventures illuminate the sudden changes in their nature. While
        attending a support group recommended by Dr. Acula for what is thought
        to be a medical condition, the three connect back with Carmilla and
        learn the truth of their new existence. Cast out by Martin and the old
        vampires, pursued by the determined Eddie Van Helsing, Ron and Carmilla
        seek to maintain some humanity and lead their menage through the
        challenges of vampire life in the modern world.</image:caption
