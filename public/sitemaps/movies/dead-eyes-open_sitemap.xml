        >Six young people on their way to a joint holiday - when the tank gets
        empty they find themselves stranded in the midst of an unknown
        wilderness. Everything looks perfect, but near an old graveyard Christin
        gets attacked by a deranged man and injured by his bite. Looking for
        help Web and Eddie discover an outlying house, its basement barricaded
        with solid perforated plates. Additionally a high metal fence seems to
        protect the shabby property from something. At last they are let into
        this odd fortress but even there the distraught feeling of a permanent
        threat won't cease. They do not know that the strange lady is hiding
        something at her garden: Something that is hungry for human flesh.
        Alarmed, they discover something incredibly dangerous has already
        changed the whole world. Old-school horror movie filmed on grainy super
        8 with slowly walking dead. Very fine traditional zombie story in the
        way of zombie master Romero.</image:caption
