        >The story of the battle to free Debbie Peagler, an incarcerated
        survivor of brutal domestic violence. Over 26 years in prison cannot
        crush the spirit of this determined African-American woman, despite the
        injustices she has experienced, first at the hands of a duplicitous
        boyfriend who beat her and forced her into prostitution, and later by
        prosecutors who cornered her into a life behind bars for her connection
        to the murder of her abuser. Her story takes an unexpected turn two
        decades later when a pair of rookie land-use attorneys cut their teeth
        on her case -- and attract global attention to the troubled intersection
        of domestic violence and criminal justice.</image:caption
