        >A stagnant and gloomy village in the 1980s. Reyhan, Nurhan, and Havva,
        three sisters were sent to town as 'besleme' (foster child and maid).
        Since they fail their foster parents for different reasons, they are
        sent back to their father's house in their poor village. Deprived of
        their dreams of a better life, they try to hold on to each
        other.</image:caption
