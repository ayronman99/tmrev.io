        >Martina, a biology student, who after moving from her hometown to
        complete her studies decides to undertake an excursion to the outskirts
        of the city in search of rare and exotic specimens for research. Not
        finding the specimen after a long search, she decides to rest by the
        roadside. At that time, her new psychotic neighbors propose to take her
        to the woods where they claim is the specimen that she seeks. Martina
        accepts the crossing naturally, but on the way the thugs kidnap her,
        determined to cause all sorts of sinister and gruesome acts, both
        physical and psychological. The story takes an unexpected turn when
        Martina decides to release her pent- up anger.</image:caption
