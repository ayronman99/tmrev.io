        >Janice and Sam have moved into their first house. Neighbors tell them
        stories about Isabelle, a former owner, who flew into a jealous rage and
        killed her husband and his lover in the house. Now, 50 years later,
        Janice has started sleep-walking and having visions of a wild German
        woman and blood, lots of blood. Janice can't remember what she does when
        she sleepwalks. Is she responsible for new murders in the area? What
        other secrets does the house hold?</image:caption
