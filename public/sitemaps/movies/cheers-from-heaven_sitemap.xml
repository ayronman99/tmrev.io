        >When bento shop owner Hikaru Oshiro learns that a group of high school
        students have no place to practice music, he takes it upon himself to
        build a studio beneath his store. The only stipulations he placed upon
        the students were that they be respectful to others, do well in school,
        and be empathetic towards others. Based on the true story of Hikaru
        Naskasone who supported students up until his death from cancer in
        November, 2009.</image:caption
