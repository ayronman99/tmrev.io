        >To provide a different experience to his subscribers, Ewing tries
        something new by exploring a playground called the Wonder Park that had
        been abandoned for a long time. With his team, Agan, Oji, Wingky, and
        Lulu, they find jacket and hat with the initials RH in the park. It is
        alleged that the objects belonged to a suicide person, but they does not
        find the body. A girl named Dinda, claims to be the sister of the owner
        of the jacket and hat. She is not sure that her brother committed
        suicide. To prove that, Dinda invites Ewing and his team to return to
        Wonder Park. At the second visit, they must face a more dire
        reality.</image:caption
