        >Told with heart, humor, and a little bit of magic, Dragonfly is a
        female led feature film about homecoming and healing for a Midwestern
        family divided by divorce and illness. Struggling artist Anna Larsen’s
        mother has never understood her. When her mom is diagnosed with early
        onset Alzheimer’s, Anna returns home to help but brings years of family
        baggage with her. As she unpacks her past, Anna rediscovers a mysterious
        mailbox from her childhood and embarks on a search to solve its mystery.
        What she learns along the way may just be the key to rekindling her own
        magic.</image:caption
