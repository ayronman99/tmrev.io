        >Hélène and Paul, early 30s and long-term singles, have been living in a
        two-person flat for years. Currently, graphic designer Paul wants to
        escape the digital constraints of his time and has acquired an age-old
        phone on which only "real" friends can reach him. One evening Paul gets
        from a friend at a party, his future predicted: Soon he will meet the
        love of his life, but also commit a murder. A short time later, when he
        meets the stunning Camille and falls in love with her, he begins to
        doubt with all luck. Could the prophecy really be true?</image:caption
