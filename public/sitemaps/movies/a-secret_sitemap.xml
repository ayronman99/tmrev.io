        >In 1953, a sensitive French boy finds out from a neighbor that his
        family's Jewish. Fran√ßois Grimbert becomes a physician, and gradually
        peels the layers of his buried family history which resulted in his
        difficult upbringing, raised as Catholic by his "Aryan" appearing
        parents. His athletic father labored to stamp out stereotypical Jewish
        characteristics he perceived in his son, to keep the family's many
        secrets, as most relatives fought in World War II, and later were hauled
        off to labor and death camps by the Gestapo.</image:caption
