        >Sham Shui Po, there is the most famous red-light district in Hong Kong.
        Li (Carrie Ng) owns a few of the apartments in the building and she
        earns a living by renting them out to the prostitutes. To the
        prostitutes though, she is more a friend than just a landlord. She gets
        together a group of prostitutes and work as hard as they could, trying
        to attract business to turn the tide. Still, they do not know they are
        quietly approaching death. It begins with the missing of a prostitute
        Ping. Ping is one of the tenants who live with her young daughter. In
        the process of finding Ping, Li discovered there had been a lot of
        missing prostitutes in this building, yet none of them were found. The
        building was somehow isolated from the outside world and a massacre
        begins. Li and the prostitutes have to find Ping and to fight a battle
        of wits with the invisible murderer. As more evident of the murderer's
        identity revealed, a tragic truth hidden for over twenty years starts to
        unveil.</image:caption
