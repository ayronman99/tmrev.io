        >The 45-minute documentary celebrates the history of the Catskill Water
        System with rare archival film footage and historic photographs. Deep
        Water tells the story of the building of the Ashokan Reservoir,
        Shandaken Tunnel, Schoharie Reservoir, and the Catskill Aqueduct.
        Narrated by Robb Webb (the voice of "60 Minutes II"), Deep Water
        documents how several Catskill Mountain towns were destroyed and
        flooded, how immigrant workers built the dams and tunnels, and how
        brilliant engineering and political maneuvering allowed the system to be
        built.</image:caption
