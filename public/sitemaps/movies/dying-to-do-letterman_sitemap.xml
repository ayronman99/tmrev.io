        >When 35 year old stand-up comedian Steve Mazan learned he was dying of
        cancer, he dedicated the rest of his life to making his dream come true:
        performing comedy on The Late Show with David Letterman. This
        documentary chronicles his five-year journey, as he races his own
        ticking clock to achieve a nearly impossible goal. Hilarious and
        heart-breaking, Steve brings a brand-new perspective to living with
        cancer. This is a story that proves it's not how much time you have,
        it's what you do with it. As Steve says, 'If you stop chasing your
        dreams, you're already dead.'</image:caption
