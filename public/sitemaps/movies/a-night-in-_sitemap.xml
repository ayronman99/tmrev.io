        >If you thought TV shows in which audiences and juries judge musical
        acts were a relatively new phenomenon, you'd better think again. In the
        1970s, such "festivals" were incredibly popular in Brazil. They were
        recorded before a live studio audience, and usually featured a number of
        elimination rounds. They also formed the springboard for the career of
        many a big-name star, such as Chico Buarque, Caetano Veloso, Roberto
        Carlos and Gilberto Gil. Appearing on such a program was no cakewalk,
        however: audiences could be as wild in their condemnation as in their
        appreciation of an artist. Extensive archive footage (including
        performances and behind-the-scenes interviews) from a turbulent final of
        the Festival of Brazilian Popular Music one evening in 1967 paints a
        fascinating picture, not only of the transformation of Brazilian music
        into real "festival" music, but also of a society starting to buck
        against the yoke of military rule.</image:caption
