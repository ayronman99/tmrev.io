        >Coldplay's 2006 world tour arrived in Toronto where they performed at
        the Air Canada Centre on 22nd and 23rd March 2006. The concert includes
        performances of hits such as Speed of Sound, Fix You and Talk. 'How We
        Saw The World (Part One)' was originally intended to be released as a
        DVD in October of 2006, however in late August a message on Coldplay's
        official website stated that it would not go on sale and would instead
        be aired on international television.</image:caption
