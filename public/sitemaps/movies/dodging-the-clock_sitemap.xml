        >The passage of time is probably the only concrete proof we have that
        justice exists in this cruel world. Some people would like to stop time
        in its tracks, while others choose to follow its path. In this story,
        three men in their early thirties have reached that age when it's time
        to start thinking about "getting a life", perhaps starting a family. But
        how do you handle the fact that your friendships are changing? That,
        slowly, your new family is becoming the center of your ever-shrinking
        world? What do you do when you realize your youth is a thing of the
        past?</image:caption
