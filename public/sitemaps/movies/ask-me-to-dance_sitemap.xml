        >Jack is an I/T programmer, a great guy, unlucky in love. Jill is a
        graphic designer, a great gal, and just as unlucky. They have no idea
        they are destined to be together. On a starry night, Jack and Jill
        separately meet a gypsy lady who tells them they will meet the love of
        their life before midnight at the end of the year, which happens to be
        only five days away. The countdown begins, and both Jack and Jill go on
        a series of horrible and hilarious dates, each worse than the next. Each
        time, they barely miss meeting each other. New Years Eve is getting
        closer. Will the gypsy's prophecy come true? Will they meet and fall in
        love?</image:caption
