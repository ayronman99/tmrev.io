        >How can one talk about death without showing the dead? Or, experience
        suffering without seeing the wounds? A possible answer is found in Amer
        & Nasser, a video-gram excerpted from a documentary on the 1991
        rebellion of Iraqi people, which turned into a bloodbath: the slow pace
        of the images allows us not really an observation, and investigation, of
        the two martyrs identity, rather it poses the questions: Why did it all
        happen, and Where were we? The two blindfolded faces apparently emanate
        serenity and resignation, but they also hide a terrible anguish. The
        slow pace of time, This Time, marks the steps of the sentenced ones, and
        the pushes and shoves of the soldiers, like it had lost its way. The
        slowing-down of the movement leads the mindâ€™s way into the maze of the
        afflicted soul. In front of the camera-spectator, the passage of the
        brothers led to an army truck, while a flute announces the imminent
        trespass of life into death, looks like one towards the
        unknown.</image:caption
