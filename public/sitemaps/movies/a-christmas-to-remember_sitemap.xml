        >A harsh TV personality, Jennifer, needs a break from her own life, so
        she hops into a car and drives to a small town mountain retreat. On her
        way there a blizzard veers off the road and she crashes. When she comes
        to she has complete amnesia and a friendly passerby takes her in. As
        time passes she still doesn’t remember who she is and the friendly
        passerby, a widower himself with three kids, assimilates her into his
        family. But as she slowly starts remembering who she is, she prefers the
        new life she’s built in the small town.</image:caption
