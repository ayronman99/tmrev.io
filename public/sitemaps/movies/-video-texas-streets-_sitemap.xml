        >Each year in the spring there is a phenomenon that occurs just north of
        the border... For four days, hundreds of the nation's fastes and most
        powerful street-raced cats converge in the city of Huston to partake in
        what has become THE craziest street race event IN THE WORLD. Once the
        sun sets, Texas Streets are overrun by 1000-plus horsepower street
        machines that are out to prove a point. Packs of 30-60 cars venture out
        on the long flat, wide highways and street race for up to 7 hours every
        night! Texas Streets is the first movie of its kind to compile all of
        the best street racing from the weekend into one video. You'll see
        1500+hp twin turbo Lamborghinis, a 1700hp Corvette, 1400_hp GT-Rs,
        1200+hp Supras, and many other monsters all featured in this video.
        Watch over 150 street races between these beasts, at times reaching
        speed over 200 MPH!</image:caption
