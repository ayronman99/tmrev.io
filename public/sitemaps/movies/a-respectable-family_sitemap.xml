        >Arash is an Iranian academic who lives in the West. He returns to Iran
        to teach in Shiraz, a city far from Tehran where his mother lives. Drawn
        into a series of domestic and financial dramas, he faces a country that
        is now alien to him. Following the death of his father and the discovery
        of what his “respectable family” has become, he is forced to make
        choices.</image:caption
