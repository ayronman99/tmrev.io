        >The latest addition to Eagle's critically acclaimed and highly
        successful Classic Albums series is Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers 1979
        breakthrough album Damn The Torpedoes . The band s third album defined
        their musical style and took them into the mainstream hitting No.2 on
        the US charts and spawning the top 10 single Don t Do Me Like That . The
        DVD features newly filmed contributions from the band members Tom Petty,
        Mike Campbell, Benmont Tench, Ron Blair and Stan Lynch along with
        co-producer Jimmy Iovine and engineer Shelly Yakus as they analyse the
        tracks from the original multi-track tapes and through new and archive
        performances. Damn The Torpedoes has stood the test of time as one of
        the great American rock albums of its era and is a worthy addition to
        the Classic Albums series.</image:caption
