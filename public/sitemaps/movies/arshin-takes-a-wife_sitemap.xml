        >Set in Baku at the turn of the 20th century, a young successful
        businessman Asgar wishes to marry. He wants his bride to be the choice
        of his heart, however, Azerbaijani tradition restricted him from
        communicating with the lady as a lover before marriage. So Asgar decides
        to disguise himself as a mere cloth peddler and the young woman
        Gulchohra falls in love with him.</image:caption
