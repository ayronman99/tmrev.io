        >Morris Buttermaker is a burned-out minor league baseball player who
        loves to drink and can't keep his hands to himself. His long-suffering
        lawyer arranges for him to manage a local Little League team, and
        Buttermaker soon finds himself the head of a rag-tag group of misfit
        players. Through unconventional team-building exercises and his offbeat
        coaching style, Buttermaker helps his hapless Bears prepare to meet
        their rivals, the Yankees.</image:caption
