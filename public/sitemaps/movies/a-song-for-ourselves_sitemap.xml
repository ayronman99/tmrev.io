        >A SONG FOR OURSELVES is an intimate journey into the life and music of
        Asian American Movement troubadour Chris Iijima. Struggling to make
        sense of their father’s early death, his teenage sons learn that during
        the 1970s when Asians in America were still considered “Orientals,”
        Chris’ music and passion for social justice helped provide the voice and
        identity an entire generation had been in search of. Through animated
        photographs, intimate home movies, archival footage of Chris’
        introduction to nationwide television by John Lennon and Chris’ own
        songs, their father’s life takes on bigger meaning than they had ever
        dreamed of.</image:caption
