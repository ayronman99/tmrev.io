        >Children of the Secret State follows Ahn Chol, a 29-year-old North
        Korean man who escaped from the country in 1997 by swimming across a
        river to China after his parents died of starvation. Chol has slipped
        back into North Korea several times since 1997 with a hidden camera to
        reveal a side of the communist nation that its government tries to hide
        from the outside world. In the documentary, viewers are exposed to many
        gruesome realities, including a food supply only available on the black
        market and small children fending for themselves to survive, scooping up
        spilled rice and corn.</image:caption
