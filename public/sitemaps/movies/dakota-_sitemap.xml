        >In the spring of 2005, Jim Miller, a Native spiritual leader and
        Vietnam veteran, found himself in a dream riding on horseback across the
        great plains of South Dakota. Just before he awoke, he arrived at a
        riverbank in Minnesota and saw 38 of his Dakota ancestors hanged. At the
        time, Jim knew nothing of the largest mass execution in United States
        history, ordered by Abraham Lincoln on December 26, 1862. Now, four
        years later, embracing the message of the dream, Jim and a group of
        riders retrace the 330-mile route of his dream on horseback from Lower
        Brule, South Dakota to Mankato, Minnesota to arrive at the hanging site
        on the anniversary of the execution. This is the story of their journey
        - the blizzards they endure, the Native and Non-Native communities that
        house and feed them along the way, and the dark history they are
        beginning to wipe away.</image:caption
