        >Timeless: Live in Concert, recorded at her Las Vegas show on New Year's
        Eve 1999, takes as its subject the star herself. It opens with a
        dramatization of her first, amateur recording session, with young Lauren
        Frost playing a part described in the credits as "Young Girl," though
        Streisand later refers to her as "mini-me." Frost doesn't get too far
        before being joined by Streisand herself on a stirring version of
        "Something's Coming" from West Side Story. The rest of "Act One" traces
        Streisand's career from her club days to her movie performances. "Act
        Two" has less of a narrative structure, though it is equally
        autobiographical, with Streisand displaying and commenting on videos of
        herself performing with other stars and building up to the stroke of
        midnight with a combination of old, recent, and new specially written
        songs. At 57 that night, Streisand remains in good voice.</image:caption
