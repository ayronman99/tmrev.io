        >Why are illegal abortions more accessible in Poland than legal ones in
        South Africa? This documentary feature explores and contrasts changes in
        Poland and South Africa regarding abortion laws and their impact on the
        lives of women. In the 90's, Poland banned abortion due to the
        increasing influence of the Catholic Church after the fall of communism;
        around the same time South Africa legalized it, reforming the health
        system after the fall of apartheid. The film reveals how the legal
        status of women is a direct result of the silencing or empowering of
        women's voices. In the Polish society and media, women's perspectives
        were made invisible; in South Africa, on the other hand, they were
        invited to give public hearings in the parliament about problems in the
        realm of reproduction.</image:caption
