        >On the eve of their ten year high school reunion, six people are
        summoned to the isolated country estate of one of their former friends,
        now a famous horror writer. Once there, separated by guilt, yet bound
        together by a terrible secret, seven adults try to reconnect with each
        other, and take stock of their lives. Outside, the storm clouds gather.
        Rain, lightning and wind isolate the house by washing out the road and
        knocking down the power lines. And then, they begin to be brutally
        murdered one by one. Someone is out there in the wind and the rain,
        someone who has waited for ten years to wreak a terrible vengeance on
        this group. Seven friends find themselves in a struggle to survive and
        outwit a diabolical killer who is savagely committed to sending them all
        to an EARLY GRAVE.</image:caption
