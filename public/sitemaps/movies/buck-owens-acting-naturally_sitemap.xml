        >Story of the singer who came out of the Texas dustbowl to become the
        king of Honky Tonk. With his Fender Telecaster guitar, no-nonsense
        style, and lush sound, Owens started a revolution in country music that
        produced such hits as "Act Naturally" and "Together Again". Despite the
        loss of his best friend and lead guitarist Don Rich to a motorcycle
        accident, Buck persevered and is now in his sixth decade of
        performing.</image:caption
