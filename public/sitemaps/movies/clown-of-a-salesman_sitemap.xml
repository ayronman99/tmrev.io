        >Il-bum works hard to pay off his daughter’s hospital bills but one day
        gets fired for being wrongly accused as a molester. After series of
        failures, Il-bum finds a job at a PR company which provides free
        entertainment to old women in exchange for buying their products. Il-bum
        feels shameful to play dirty tricks on old women but he has no other
        choice. Despite his initial concerns, Il-bum starts to feel a sense of
        worth entertaining old women. A new team member, Ok-nim joins and Il-bum
        becomes a good friend to her, making her feel warm and safe which she
        never gets from her own son. But, the joy of their friendship won’t hold
        long when Il-bum’s debt reaches beyond help.</image:caption
