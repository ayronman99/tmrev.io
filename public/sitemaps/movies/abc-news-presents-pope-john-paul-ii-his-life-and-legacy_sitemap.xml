        >The intriguing life of Pope John Paul II is profiled in this
        comprehensive documentary that paints a thorough portrait of the man so
        many Catholics look to for guidance, healing and strength. His courage
        and resolve as a leader have put him at the forefront of a religion
        often caught up in controversy. Narrated by Bill Blakemore, this release
        also includes the Pope's unique 2003 appearance on television's "Good
        Morning America."</image:caption
