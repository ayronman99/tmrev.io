        >Saddened about spending another Christmas alone, Ali meets Ginny, a
        quirky and spunky woman, at a diner on Christmas Eve. Ali tells Ginny
        that she was to be married on New Year's Eve last year, but over the
        course of the holidays she and her fianc√© unexpectedly split. When Ali
        explains that she would do everything differently if she could go back
        in time, Ginny tells her that "sometimes people do get second chances."
        The following morning, Ali wakes up to find herself transported back to
        that Christmas before her planned wedding. While she sets out to avoid
        the mistakes of her past, she learns that changing the course of history
        is no easy task.</image:caption
