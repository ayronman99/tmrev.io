        >The piece, directed by Aitor Throup - was commissioned by Nowness.com
        especially to mark their relaunch on the 29th of September 2014. The
        film not only depicts an actual 3 dimensional portrait of Rapace being
        intricately sculpted, but also acts as a portrait of her in itself, by
        acting as a metaphor for the various chronological steps in the actorâ€™s
        process. Flying Lotus, the highly acclaimed forward thinking musician
        and producer provides an exclusive soundtrack of 6 different previously
        unreleased material, which was born out of conversations between him and
        Throup at the beginning of the project.</image:caption
