        >Major Ram is one of the few soldiers from the Indian Army who have been
        held captive in Pakistan, following the war with India. The Indian army
        and politicians are unable to make any decision so as not to jeopardize
        the lives of the captives. Major Ram's brother, Arjun, alias Sunny
        decides to take it upon himself to enter Pakistan and get his brother
        free. He now calls himself Salman. On the way he meets with beautiful
        Ruksar and both fall in love with each other. Unfortunately for them,
        they cannot be married, so they elope, leading to an unrest within their
        community, and a hunt is on for them. Salman and Ruksar chance upon the
        prison camp that is housing Ram, and do get him free, only to find
        themselves trapped by Pakistani Jihaadis and soldiers.</image:caption
