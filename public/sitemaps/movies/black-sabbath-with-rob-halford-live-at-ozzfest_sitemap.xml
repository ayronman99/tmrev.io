        >Ozzy Osbourne was forced to sit out BLACK SABBATH's performance at
        Thursday night's (Aug. 26) Ozzfest in Camden, NJ due to an attack of
        bronchitis. He was replaced at the concert by none other than JUDAS
        PRIEST frontman Rob Halford. Commented Rob at the show: "Yesterday [Aug.
        25] was my [53rd] birthday and I feel as if today is too! I'm getting to
        sing for one of my favorite bands in the world." The songs performed at
        the show were "War Pigs", "Fairies Wear Boots", "N.I.B.", "Black
        Sabbath", "Iron Man", "Into the Void", "Children of the Grave", the
        intro to "Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath" followed by "Paranoid". Halford had
        previously joined SABBATH for two gigs to support Ozzy on his last shows
        for the "No More Tours" tour in November 1992 in Costa Mesa, CA after
        SABBATH's singer at the time, Ronnie James Dio, refused to take the
        stage.</image:caption
