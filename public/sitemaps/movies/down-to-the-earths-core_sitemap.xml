        >Down to the Earth’s Core takes viewers from the sidewalk to the centre
        of the planet in one epic unbroken shot. Using spectacular computer
        generated imagery; the camera smashes through almost 9 000 kilometres of
        solid rock to explore the hidden world beneath our feet. Experience an
        earthquake inside the San Andreas Fault, blast out of a volcano,
        encounter bizarre cave-dwelling creatures and enter caves full of giant
        crystals – all inside planet Earth. As the camera lowers into Earth's
        bosom, the planet’s extraordinary story, is laid bare layer by layer,
        showing how prehistoric forests became modern-day fuel, witnessing the
        dinosaur’s cataclysmic death, and watching as stalactites form and gold
        grows before our eyes. Deeper, beyond the reach of any mine, any drill,
        we find wonders beyond imagination: towering molten metal tornadoes,
        forests of solid iron crystals, until we reach the strangest, least
        understood place on the planet – the core.</image:caption
