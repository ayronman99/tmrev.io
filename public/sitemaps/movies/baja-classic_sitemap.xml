        >Academy-award nominated motorcycle-racing filmmaker Bruce Brown takes
        his camera on the road to capture the grueling punishment of the famed
        Baja 1000 in an all-star race in which James Garner, Parnelli Jones, and
        Motorcycle Hall of Fame inductee Malcom Smith all struggle against the
        elements and each other in hopes of crossing the finish line first. From
        four-wheelers to motorcycles and even passenger cars, this race features
        a variety of unique vehicles as they attempt to conquer the rugged
        Mexican Baja peninsula. With all new interviews and commentary unearthed
        by Brown's grandson Wes and partner TJ Barrack, three generations of
        family filmmakers gather to pay tribute to the man who brought the
        thrill of the race to the screen for all to enjoy.</image:caption
