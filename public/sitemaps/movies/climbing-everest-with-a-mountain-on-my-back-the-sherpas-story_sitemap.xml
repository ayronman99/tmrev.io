        >Every year, over a thousand climbers try to reach the summit of Mount
        Everest, with the annual record for successful attempts currently
        standing at 633. But of that number, nearly half were Sherpas - the
        mountain's unsung heroes. Yet the Sherpa community has remained
        secretive about their nation, culture and experiences living in the
        shadow of the world's highest mountain. Now, for the first time, they
        open the door into their world. Without the expertise of the Sherpas,
        only the hardiest and most skilful climbers would succeed. Every day
        they risk their lives for the safety of others, yet they seek neither
        glory nor reward, preferring to stay in the background. Following the
        stories of four such Sherpas - Phurba, Ngima, Ngima Tenji and Gelu -
        this film reveals the reality of their daily lives, not just up the
        mountain, but with their families after they return home.</image:caption
