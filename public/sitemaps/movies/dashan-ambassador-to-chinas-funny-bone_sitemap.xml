        >Mark Rowswell may well be one of the most popular comedians Canada has
        ever produced. A virtual unknown in his own country, Rowswell has an
        enormous following in mainland China, where he is known as Dashan. His
        appearances on Chinese television have drawn up to six hundred million
        viewers. Together wih his Chinese partner and mentor, Ding Guangquan,
        Rowswell practices a comedic art form known as crosstalk, whose roots
        stretch back centuries.</image:caption
