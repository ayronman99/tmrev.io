        >This 75+ minute film, directed by Rafa Alcantara of TWENTYFOURCORE
        Productions, candidly captures the band's ten-year history, with
        extensive behind the scenes and never before seen footage. "It basically
        tells the story of the band, from its inception to present day, says
        front man David Draiman. "The band has had its share of ups and downs
        along the way and I think we tried to be as open and honest about all of
        it as we could. It's very insightful and we hope its something the fans
        will appreciate."</image:caption
