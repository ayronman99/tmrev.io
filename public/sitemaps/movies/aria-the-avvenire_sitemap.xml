        >Now that Akari Mizunashi is a Prima Undine and head of the Aria Company
        with her own apprentice, Ai Aino, she can't help but reminisce about her
        time as a Single. She has new responsibilities and much less time on her
        hands, but these changes bring with them new forms of miracles that Neo
        Venezia can give. Growing up into new roles is hard, but Akari can
