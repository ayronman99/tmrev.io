        >BEAUTIFUL NOISE is an in-depth exploration of a music movement in the
        late twentieth century, a fascinating period when some innovative
        musicians mixed guitar noise into conventional pop song structures while
        maintaining a philosophy of letting the music speak for itself. Although
        many of the people interviewed are notoriously press shy they have
        opened up about their music and experiences from over 20 years ago, how
        they defied the rules and became sonic innovators that have inspired so
        many.</image:caption
