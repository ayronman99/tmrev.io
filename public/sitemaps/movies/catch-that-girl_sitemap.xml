        >Ida's father suddenly gets a stroke and is rushed to the hospital,
        diagnosed with a deadly disease with no other opportunity than to travel
        to USA to attend a medical experimental operation. Unfortunately, the
        small family have to get the money themselves, as the state doesn't pay
        for that kind of experimental procedures. Ida has to get the money - and
        she got no other way than to steal them from the bank where her mother
        works...... developing the banks intense security.</image:caption
