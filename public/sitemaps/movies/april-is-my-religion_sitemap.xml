        >College is far more than beer bashes and sex romps, cute hook-ups and
        classes. It can also be the seamiest and strangest place to finally grow
        up. That's what a freshman, Jack Wesson, discovers when he graduates and
        attends a university, where hard drugs and mind-bending relationships
        usher him into the hard knocks of adulthood. Having completely lost
        control of his life, Jack must claw his way back to solid
        ground.</image:caption
