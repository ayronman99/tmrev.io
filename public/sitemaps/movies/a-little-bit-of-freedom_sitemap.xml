        >In the metropolitan city of Hamburg, illegal immigrant Chernor, an
        openly gay African youth with blond hair, makes his money by dealing
        drugs and dreams of one day living in Australia. Baran, meanwhile, is a
        Kurdish bicycle delivery boy living in constant fear of deportation, who
        keeps his past in a video camera. The two form a bond when they meet,
        and their shared struggles to survive soon develop into a relationship
        that is threatened when Baran loses his job.</image:caption
