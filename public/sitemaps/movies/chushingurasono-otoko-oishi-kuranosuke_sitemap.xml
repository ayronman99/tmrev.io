        >In the spring of Genroku 14 (1701), Oishi Kuranosuke (Tamura Masakazu),
        the chief retainer of the Asano family in Ako domain is shocked to learn
        that his feudal lord, Asano Takumi-no-kami Naganori (Tamayama Tetsuji),
        had stabbed Kira Kozukenosuke Yoshinaka (Nishida Toshiyuki), the master
        of ceremonies, at Edo castle. Lord Asano was ordered to commit ritual
        suicide and the Ako clan abolished. Facing up to the gravity of this
        unfair ruling, since only one party was being punished instead of both
        as would be usual, Oishi decides to lead the loyal former retainers in
        an attack on Lord Kira so that he could take Kira’s head to his lord’s
        gravesite so that Lord Asano could finally rest in peace.</image:caption
