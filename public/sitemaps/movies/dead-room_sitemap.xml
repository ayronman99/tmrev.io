        >Dead Room is the dark and twistedly violent story of the various
        occupants of innocuously numbered Room No. 2. An otherwise ordinary flat
        in London, owned by its lively but untrustworthy Nigerian Landlord, No.
        2 is a room that was born bad. It attracts the wrong people, and
        something weird always happens there. A young and sensitive writer
        goaded beyond endurance by an old enemy, an actress who is the victim of
        a crazed, bomb-making Stalker, a late night seance which goes gruesomely
        wrong, and a dangerously insane assassin on a gleeful killing spree.
        Four examples of just how macabre and downright odd Room No. 2's history
        is.</image:caption
