        >The movie takes place again in the fictional Wangan Station of the
        Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department the once empty space within
        Wangan's jurisdiction has become a popular tourist attraction. When a
        string of murders of company execs begins taking place, Aoshima jumps at
        the opportunity to pursue something other than his current case, which
        he finds less than inspiring. However the powers that be have other
        ideas, and Wangan again plays host to a special investigation team from
        headquarters. Aoshima's friend Superintendent Shinji Muroi, assigned by
        headquarters to assist Okita, is again powerless to help the local
        officers as decisions are made by the higher ups.</image:caption
