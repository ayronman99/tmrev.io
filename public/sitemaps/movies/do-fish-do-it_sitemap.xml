        >16-year old Jan is absent-mindedly strolling through the streets when
        he's run over by roller-skating Nina. As fast as she has stormed into
        his life, however, she rushes off again. Nina is 15 years old and full
        of crazy ideas. She lives together with her brother, her father and his
        new girlfriend. Her mother isn't in touch much. That's why there is the
        unconventional Angel whose own daughter disappeared years ago and who is
        Nina's best friend and substitute mother.</image:caption
