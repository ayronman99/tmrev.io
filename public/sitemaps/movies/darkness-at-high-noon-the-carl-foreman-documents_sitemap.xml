        >Once the drama inherent in screenwriter Carl Foreman's story moves from
        an intro to his career beginnings and what he put on the page into what
        he was obliged to maneuver personally and professionally in the
        shark-infested waters of McCarthyism, leading to his HUAC summons, his
        resilient defiance of pressures to capitulate, and then exile to London
        as the only alternative to prison, just for refusing to "name names,"
        this documentary takes on a riveting power of an all-too-relevant tale
        of free speech, civil liberties, and coercive intrigue in the name of
        pseudo-patriotism and feels like fresh insight despite the many looks
        into the blacklist era in both docu and drama over recent
        decades.</image:caption
