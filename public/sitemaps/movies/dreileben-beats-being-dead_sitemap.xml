        >Johannes is a loner who wants a better job. And then he meets Ana. Ana
        is attractive and even though her job is even less prestigious than
        Johannes's, he falls for her. And then she quits her job to be with him
        (and be dependent on him) and suddenly things become much more serious.
        She has fallen for him. But does he still love her? Did he ever? Enter
        Sarah. Sarah is the daughter of Johannes's boss. He and she have a past.
        Will Sarah and what she represents be his future, and Ana just a memory,
        something he'd like to erase?</image:caption
