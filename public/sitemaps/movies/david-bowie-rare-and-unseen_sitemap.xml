        >Most famous for his alter-ego, the ostentatious, androgynous "Ziggy
        Stardust", Bowie has continually reinvented his music and image. He has
        had numerous top ten hits in the US & UK, most notably China Girl, Space
        Oddity, Under Pressure and more. Told through archive interviews
        (originally thought lost) and rare and unseen footage, this DVD is a
        worthy addition to any Bowie collection. Items genuinely unseen and
        never before appeared on DVD including film from the ITN archive.
        Includes lost and now restored TV interviews from the past and rare film
        of the singer talking about his career.</image:caption
