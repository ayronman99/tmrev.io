        >Creedence Clearwater Revival: The Broadcast Archives is a collection of
        live performances from the American roots rock band that had a string of
        hits in the 60's and 70's. Creedence Clearwater Revival were a band that
        during their peak could supply a seemingly endless supply of timeless
        three-minute rock classics showcasing the powerful vocals of John
        Fogerty. This performance from their first European tour at the Royal
        Albert Hall demonstrates why they were regarded as Americas greatest
        rock band of the sixties and includes many of their best known hits.
        These rare performances will delight long-term fans, collectors and a
        new music generation discovering Creedence Clearwater Revival for the
        first time.</image:caption
