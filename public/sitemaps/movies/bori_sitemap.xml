        >Bori, an 11-year-old girl who lives in a sea village, is the only
        family member who can hear. Being an elementary school student, Bori
        gradually becomes more familiar with communicating with her friends at
        school by speaking and has a difficult time joining a sign language
        conversation at home. Why was I the only person born different from my
        family? The more she thinks about it, the more she feels
        alienated.</image:caption
