        >Tired of their stressful parisian lifestyle, Caroline and Bertrand
        decide to start a new life, running a traditional gîte in deepest
        Provence. It is not long before they start to question the wisdom of
        this move – the buldings are in a state of near-dilapidation, their
        friend and supposed partner Sophie has walked out on them, and they are
        but a stone’s throw from a far more attarctive holiday home, catering
        for gay men. Will this change be as good as a rest or the start of a
        nightmare?</image:caption
