        >Four years have passed since the unsuccessful search of the "brothers"
        Ernst, Ludwig and Adrian Stadler ended after a common father with the
        determination: "I have three still brothers". Ernst has now acquired
        fame with a cooking program on television. He lives separately from Iris
        The mother of his twins. Ludwig operates a well -walking bourgeois
        restaurant. Adrian helps in the kitchen there and, because of a side
        jump by friend Michael, moves from the shared apartment to Ludwig into
        the mother's house. The ratio of the three fake brothers still shapes
        the ratio of the three fake brothers. When Adrian processes the
        experiences of the father search in a novel and develop between Ludwig
        and Iris tender gang, even the resilience of Stadlerscher family gang
        seems to have finally exceeded their limits and their lust for the
        argument have lost the unifying force.</image:caption
