        >In 1909, in an undemocratic Sweden, a bastard child is born and given
        the name of Hervor. Her mother is unmarried, due to which she is called
        a "whore' and is driven from her home. Hervor grows up at shelters and
        orphanages, unwanted, rejected by society. As an adult she spends her
        life struggling for social justice. In old age she tells us her story.
        Director Knutte Wester brings his grandmother's memories to life thought
        hand-painted animated images and has us witness someone being rejected
        in order to unite others. A story that all too often still repeating
        itself.</image:caption
