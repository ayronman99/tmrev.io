        >The story revolves around an insecure teetotaler Sarathy (Karunas) who
        feels bad due to his dark skin (his wife Karthika is fairer than him)
        who is often the brunt of many jokes. Because he feels inferior to his
        wife, he begins to suspect her of infidelity and to think that she will
        one day elope with a lover. After a misunderstanding, Sarathy and his
        mother are estranged which further weakens the bond between Sarathy and
        Karthika. How Sarathy resolves his issues and gets back together with
        Karthika forms the rest of the story.</image:caption
