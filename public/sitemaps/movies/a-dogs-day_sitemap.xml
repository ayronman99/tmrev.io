        >A local ruler bows down to the pressure from democratic forces and is
        forced to hand over a part of his province to a democratically elected
        leader. He also presents his pet dog to a poor peasant and his wife. For
        the poor peasant and his wife, the dog is not a mere dog, but a symbol
        of the royalty which had always inspired in them feelings of respect,
        admiration and blind worship. They bathe the dog in a very ceremonious
        manner and take much care of it. They even desist from tying it up. But
        when the dog bites and kills a duck and then a boy, it leads to
        problems. The democratic leader orders the arrest of the dog, followed
        by the arrest of the poor peasant. Then follow protests, talks,
        negotiations leading to more interesting developments.</image:caption
