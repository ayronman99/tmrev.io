        >Darryl Hell's interview experiment with Douglas P. took place amongst
        the rumbles, hisses, and thunks of the belly of a New York City
        skyscraper...during a harsh January 2005 blizzard. This would be the
        first time Douglas would take part in this type of interview project.
        Its flow replicates a meandering day-long conversation that was held
        between Douglas P. and Darryl Hell at Mindswerve Studio, New York City,
        in 2004. Their many life experiences in 1970's, 1980's punk rock, made
        for a fertile ground. Hell's vision for the project was to give Douglas
        a chance to fully articulate himself without the boundaries of the
        traditional interview format. The result is a roller coaster ride
        through Douglas' life from childhood into the future.</image:caption
