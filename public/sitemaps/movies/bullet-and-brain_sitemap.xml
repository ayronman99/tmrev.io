        >Amidst the gunfights and bloodshed in a city of sin, there lived two
        legendary figures, known only as Bullet and Brain. Bullet, as the name
        suggests, is the sharpest shooter the city has ever seen and can take
        someone out with a pistol in less than a tenth of a second. Brain, on
        the other hand, is a calculated genius with excellent problem-solving
        skills, not to mention some cool gadgetry. These two men are called into
        action again when an old score involving a little girl needs to be
        settled.</image:caption
