        >Carlos Castaneda, sixties author and ‘celebrated godfather of New Age’
        died in his Los Angeles home in 1998. Five women forming his ‘harem’
        disappeared within days. In 2004, bones are found at the edge of Death
        Valley belonging to one of the disappeared women. In a series of
        Californian road trips, filmmaker Minou Norouzi reflects on what the
        women’s obsession with Castaneda may have been and begins to wonder if
        her own life isn’t mirroring theirs. She meets a concoction of Castaneda
        associates who are all invested in telling her about Castaneda, whilst
        the story of the women remains in shadow.</image:caption
