        >Single and middle-aged, beautiful Irene (Margarita Buy) is wholly
        devoted to her job as an inspector of luxury hotels. Constantly on the
        road, she indulges in expensive pleasures at impeccable resorts, but
        always incognito and alone, soon escaping to the next exotic destination
        with her checklist and laptop in tow. When her best friend and ex,
        Andrea (Stefano Accorsi), who has always been a source of emotional
        support, suddenly becomes unavailable, Irene is thrown into a deep
        existential crisis. "Luxury is a form of deceit," she is told by a
        fellow traveller in the fog of a steam room, and thus begins Irene's
        quest to bring more meaning into her life.</image:caption
