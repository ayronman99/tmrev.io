        >It is the War Between the States and Peyton Farquhar stands at the end
        of a plank a noose around his neck. He has been betrayed by a stranger,
        a scout for the Union Army, and now he faces death. He stands to lose a
        beautiful young wife, family and home. The soldiers make preparations
        for his death, it is routine for them. Peyton's mind races, he must
        escape. If only he can free his hands. The plank falls and
        incomprehensibly the rope breaks. He manages to swim away and evade the
        gunshots from the soldiers. He unbelievably finds himself on shore
        running towards home. After what seems like days of weary travel he
        arrives.</image:caption
