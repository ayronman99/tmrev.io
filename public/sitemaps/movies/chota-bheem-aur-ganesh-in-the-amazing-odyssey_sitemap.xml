        >Raja Laalachmaan and his sidekick, Jadoogar Jobba, awaken an ancient
        monster Krur. This monster, needs the souls of the purest kingdom. Raja
        Laalachmaan realizes the best place to find the purest souls is
        Dholakpur. Raja Laalachmaan and his soldiers take over Dholakpur. Bheem
        manages to rescue many people, but Laachlamaan kidnaps Raja
        Indraverma-ll and Princess Indumati says that if the people of Dholakpur
        do not surrender themssssselves, they will die. So, Bheem and his
        friends go on the trail. They are helped by ancient clues left in the
        forest and at sea. But the one person that helps them the most is Chhota
        Ganesh.He says he is always present on New years, but Kru's invasion of
        Dholakpur has already started. Can Bheem and Ganesh defeat
        him??</image:caption
