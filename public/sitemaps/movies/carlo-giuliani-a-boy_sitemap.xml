        >The film recounts Carlo Giuliani’s day of July 20 and, parallel to it,
        the July 20 of the march of the ‘disobedients’, or the ‘white overalls’,
        among whose ranks Carlo died. An individual’s story is told in all its
        absolute concreteness, the friends he meets, the snack bar he goes to
        for a bite, the roll of scotch tape he picks up on the street; whereas a
        multitude’s story is told in all its epic tragedy, the night under the
        rain, the colossal preparation against the march, the advance behind
        shields, the attack of which the multitude was victim, the defense that
        gets organized.</image:caption
