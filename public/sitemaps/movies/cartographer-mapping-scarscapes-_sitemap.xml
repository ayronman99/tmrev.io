        >Created through direct animation in which the artist etched and
        scratched lines and forms on photo negatives, this spectral and poetic
        film touches on themes of loss and rootlessness. Imbued with
        expressionist energy and featuring fleeting ghostly figures and
        landscapes, the work is inspired by the artistâ€™s attempt to grapple with
        his fading memories of past voyages across Southeast
        Asia.</image:caption
