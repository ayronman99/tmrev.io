        >In 2010 six reality television show contestants spent seven nights in
        an abandoned and haunted asylum. The show never aired but an editor for
        the network was able to piece together some footage. The prize for
        staying all seven nights was a share of one million dollars that was to
        be split amongst any contestants that didn't leave. No prize money was
        ever awarded.</image:caption
