        >Beginning just before his debut as Frankenstein’s creation, this
        documentary compellingly explores the life and legacy of a cinema
        legend, presenting a perceptive history of the genre he personified.
        Karloff's films were long derided as hokum and attacked by censors, but
        his phenomenal popularity and pervasive influence endures, inspiring
        some of our greatest actors and directors into the 21st Century – among
        them Guillermo Del Toro, Ron Perlman, Roger Corman, and John Landis, all
        of whom and many more contribute their personal insights and
        anecdotes.</image:caption
