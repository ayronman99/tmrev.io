        >After a string of incompatible dorm mates, Finn – an unapologetic,
        collegiate underachiever and extreme party boy – hopes that a new year
        is going to bring some better luck. But 15-year-old, nerdy, brainiac
        Toby isn't exactly who he had in mind. After an extremely rough start,
        the two overcome their differences and team up to exact revenge on
        campus jock, Landon, and his posse of goons, who think they rule the
        school.</image:caption
