        >The prophecy of Khoa Lê’s 93-year-old grandmother (bà nôi) burdens his
        unknown future and reflects the roots of his past. Born in Vietnam but
        raised in Canada, Lê’s homeland pilgrimage is measured parts
        self-portrait, ethnography and an ethereal quest for identity. His bà
        nôi is funny and forthright in a matriarchal manner, as one with little
        time to worry about what others think. Stark observations of her home
        life and family visits contrast visually stunning dreamlike sequences of
        fog-laced silhouettes and twilight vistas that echo an unpredictable
        path. As he celebrates New Year’s events with family traditions and
        rituals steeped in superstition, fortunes and horoscopes, it’s clear Lê
        is seeking signs of destiny as he poetically captures a soul floating
        between two worlds.</image:caption
