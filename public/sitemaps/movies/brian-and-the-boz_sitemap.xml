        >In some ways, Barry Switzer and Brian Bosworth were made for each
        other. The Oklahoma coach and the linebacker he recruited to play for
        him were both out-sized personalities who delighted in thumbing their
        noses at the establishment. And in their three seasons together
        (1984-86), the unique father-son dynamic resulted in 31 wins and two
        Orange Bowl victories as Bosworth was awarded the first two Butkus
        Awards. But then Bosworth's alter ego: "The Boz," took over both their
        lives and ultimately destroyed their careers. In "Brian and The Boz,"
        Bosworth looks back on the mistakes he made and passes on the lessons he
        learned to his son. It's a revealing portrait of a man who had and lost
        it all, and a trip back to a time when enough just wasn't
        enough.</image:caption
