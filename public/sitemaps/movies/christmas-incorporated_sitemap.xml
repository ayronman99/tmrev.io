        >Sometimes, life just seems to hand you exactly what you need –
        particularly at Christmastime. Riley is scraping bottom when she
        miraculously lands a job with a wealthy New York City entrepreneur. He’s
        a bad-boy socialite type who is poised to play Scrooge by closing one of
        his factories just before Christmas, which would devastate an entire
        town. It’s left to Riley to talk him out of it and turn him into a man
        of virtue rather than shame.</image:caption
