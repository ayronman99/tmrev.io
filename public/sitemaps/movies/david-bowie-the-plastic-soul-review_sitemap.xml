        >There were 3 distinct periods in the life of David Bowie during the
        1970s. The first of course consisted of his Glam years, defined best by
        the startling Ziggy Stardust album. At the other end of the decade came
        the Berlin trilogy three dark, industrial yet ambient and often joyous
        works. But sandwiched between these is what has come to be known via the
        man's own comments as the Plastic Soul Era, an era just as creative,
        magnificent and popular as any other during Bowie s career, yet one
        rarely considered as a stand alone and separate entity within his
        complete body of work.</image:caption
