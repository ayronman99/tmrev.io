        >It was a chance meeting started by one of Sol’s friends trying to chat
        up Jennifer. However, in the end, it was those two who hit it off. Sol
        enjoyed Jen’s smile, her effort, and how silly she could be. Jen enjoyed
        Sol’s cooking, his athleticism, and that he would join her in fun
        moments. As you can imagine, love bloomed, and things got serious. Jen’s
        investment in Sol led to her pushing him to follow his dreams and even
        move in to save money. Sol’s investment in Jen well, it led to him
        proposing. But what started as a liver tumor grew into full-on cancer,
        so with a diagnosis of 6 months to live, Sol and Jennifer try to make
        the best of it.</image:caption
