        >On the eve of the admissions cycle for New York City kindergartens,
        Alex and Greg Wheeler have high hopes for four-year-old Jake. The
        director of Jake's preschool encourages them to accentuate Jake's gender
        expansive behavior to help him stand out. As Alex and Greg navigate

        other.</image:caption
