        >In the year 60 B.C. a group of Druids, including the arch-druid
        Guttuart (Max von Sydow), witness the passing of a comet and interpret
        it as the sign of the coming of a king for their country Gaul, which has
        not had a king for a long time. Guttuart goes to Gergovia, the capital
        of the Arvenes tribe, to attend a meeting of Gallic tribal chieftains.
        The young boy Vercingetorix, along with his friend the young girl
        Eponia, sneak into a large cavern where Celtill, Vercingetorix's father
        and chieftain of the Arvenes, hosts the meeting of chieftains with the
        intention of proclaiming himself king of all Gauls. When Celtill shows
        off the crown once worn by the old kings of Gaul, an arrow from two
        Roman spies (dressed as Gauls) hits Celtill in the back.</image:caption
