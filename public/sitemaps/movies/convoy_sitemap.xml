        >Director of detention, director Nowacki (Janusz Gajos) finds Sergeant
        Zawada, who is hiding from the world (Robert Więckiewicz). An
        experienced officer returns to the game and gets a new task - he becomes
        the commander of the convoy, who is to transport a very dangerous
        prisoner to a psychiatric hospital. Members of his team are people with
        a complicated past. Among them is also Feliks (Tomasz Ziętek), full of
        ideals, privately the husband of Nowacki's daughter (Agnieszka
        Żulewska), who should never have found himself in a prisoner. The prison
        director, having lost control of the convoy, chases to repair, and may
        hide the uncomfortable truth for him. The real purpose of the convoy is
        slowly coming to light. Conflicts arise between men and tension
        increases, with unexpected twists every minute. From now on, justice can
        be done on its own.</image:caption
