        >Niamh is the lone survivor of a mysterious massacre in which the
        furniture and objects in her familyâ€™s isolated house took on a monstrous
        life of their own. The police ignore her wild stories, and the
        neighbours and social worker who take her into their care try to

        past behind her, endangering everyone who crosses her
        path.</image:caption
