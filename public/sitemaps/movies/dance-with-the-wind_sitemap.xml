        >In a hospital parking lot, Officer Song Yeon-hwa is briefed about Park
        Pung-shik, an alleged gigolo who preys on rich housewives. One of his
        latest victims is the police chief's wife, who refuses to testify
        against him, despite giving him $30,000. Song is told to go undercover
        as a hospital patient in order to secure evidence leading to his arrest.
        In the hospital, she finds the mild-mannered Park and talks to him over
        coffee, where he mentions that he ballroom dances for a living. Song
        asks him why he came to become a dancer and he starts his
        story.</image:caption
