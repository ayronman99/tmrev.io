        >The true story of four men who narrowly escaped death at the hands of
        Argentina's military death squads in 1977. Claudio Tamburrini is a
        goalie for a minor-league football team when he is abducted by members
        of the Argentine military police and taken to an unofficial detention
        center on the false suspicion that he is a terrorist. As he is tortured
        by intelligence agents looking for information he doesn't have,
        Tamburrini fully expects to be killed. After many sessions of brutal
        torture, Tamburrini and his fellow captives Guillermo and Tano are being
        readied for execution when, in a final desperate act, Tamburrini dives
        out a window during a rainstorm.</image:caption
