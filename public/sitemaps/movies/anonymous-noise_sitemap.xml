        >Every day, a young girl wearing a mask stands by the beach and sings a
        nostalgic melody. After experiencing two sudden heart-wrenching partings
        when she was only a child, Nino Arisugawa has been singing her songs to
        the ocean, bound by a promise made with her two childhood friendsâ€”her
        first love, Momo Sakaki, and a boy who composed music, Kanade "Yuzu"
        Yuzuriha. Having never met each other, the boys both individually
        promised that if Nino was ever separated from them, her voice would be
        the beacon to reunite them once again.</image:caption
