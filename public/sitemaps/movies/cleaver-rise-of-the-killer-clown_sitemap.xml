        >When Carlton Layton arrives home to find his wife in the arms of
        another man, he dons the outfit he wears as a children's entertainer and
        slaughters them both, fleeing into the night. Five years later, Carley
        Lewis is asked to babysit on Halloween night whilst the child's parents
        go out to a party. But someone wants the child. Someone we know only as
        "The Cleaver".</image:caption
