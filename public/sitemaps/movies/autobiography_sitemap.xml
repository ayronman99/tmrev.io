        >With his father in prison and his brother abroad for work, young Rakib
        works as the lone housekeeper in an empty mansion belonging to Purna, a
        retired general whose family Rakib’s clan have served for centuries in a
        rural Indonesian town. After Purna returns home to start his mayoral
        election campaign, Rakib bonds with the older man, who becomes a close
        mentor and father figure, and finds his calling as Purna’s assistant in
        work and life. When Purna’s election poster is found vandalised one day,
        Rakib doesn’t hesitate to track down the culprit, kicking off an
        escalating chain of violence.</image:caption
