        >This funny short animation was written and created by Tali (At Home
        with Mrs. Hen) and is inspired by the filmmaker's misadventures as a
        school bus driver in the Eastern Townships. Our protagonist dreams of
        becoming a bus driver in order to cruise down quiet country lanes and
        connect with nature, her young charges and their parents. But her
        idyllic view of her new job is sorely tested after she meets her surly
        boss, named Killer, and discovers that winding roads can prove
        treacherous in winter, especially with a faulty clutch. Through her
        cheeky humour and oblique look at the reality of people living in the
        Quebec countryside, Tali delivers a film that is unique, witty and
        touching. - Written by NFB</image:caption
