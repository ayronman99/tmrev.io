        >Un Buda follows two brothers orphaned as children when their parents
        were taken by the military during the "Dirty Wars" of the 1970s in
        Argentina. Tomas is now a drifting and withdrawn young man who
        experiments with ascetic practices and has an instinctive compassion for
        others. His older brother Rafael is a university philosophy professor,
        detached and alone. Their struggles with each other and the world around
        them in Buenos Aires take a dramatic turn when they find themselves at a
        rural Zen center.</image:caption
