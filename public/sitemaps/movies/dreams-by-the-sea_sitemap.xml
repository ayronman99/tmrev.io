        >Ester (16) lives a safe but mundane life, in a small town on an island
        together with her religious and conservative parents. One day, when
        she’s in Sunday school, she meets Ragna, a girl who has just moved to
        the same small town with her alcoholic mother and her 8 year-old
        brother. In Ragna, Ester sees what she has been looking for her whole
        life. Unaware that Ragna sees the exact same thing in Ester, and
        especially Ester’s father. The attraction of opposites makes them best
        friends. Together they dream about getting away from their boring life
        on the island, but soon they realize that it’s only their own self that
        they want to escape from.</image:caption
