        >A grade school English teacher Sarah Gonzales joins the 150,000 Pinoy
        OFWs working in the United Kingdom to support her Husband, Teddy
        Gonzales in making a better living for their family. More than just a
        chronicle of the Filipinos experience working as nurses and caregivers
        in the UK, this story also charts Sarah's journey to self-discovery from
        a submissive wife who makes sacrifices for her Husband; Teddy's
        aspirations to an empowered woman who finds dignity and pride in a
        humbling job as a Caregiver in London.</image:caption
