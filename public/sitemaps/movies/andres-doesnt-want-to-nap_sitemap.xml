        >After the accidental death of his mother, Andres has to move in with
        his grandmother, Olga, and his estranged father Raul. Andres, who
        doesn't like to take a nap, wanders curiously through the neighborhood,
        where an illegal detention center is hidden, something everyone knows,
        but no one dare mention. Courage and fears will be tested with lasting
        consequences for all.</image:caption
