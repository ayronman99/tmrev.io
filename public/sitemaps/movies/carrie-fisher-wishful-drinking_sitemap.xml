        >"Wishful Drinking" is based on Fisher's memoirs of the same title. The
        stage adaptation had its world premiere in 2006 at the Geffen Playhouse
        in L.A. It later played at Berkeley Repertory before opening on Broadway
        in October at Studio 54. The show takes audiences on a comic tour of
        Fisher's messy personal life and career. The actress-writer recounts
        stories about her work on the "Star Wars" series as well as her
        relationship with her parents Eddie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds. She also
        discusses her much-publicized problems with alcohol and
        drugs.</image:caption
