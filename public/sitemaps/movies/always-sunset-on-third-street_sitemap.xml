        >Leaving her provincial home, teenage Mutsuko arrives in Tokyo by train
        to take a job in a major automotive company but finds that she is
        employed by a small auto repair shop owned by Norifumi Suzuki. Suzuki's
        hair-trigger temper is held somewhat in check by the motherly instincts
        of his wife, Tomoe, and his young son Ippei immediately bonds with
        Mutsuko as if she were his older sister. The Suzuki shop lies almost in
        the shadow of the Tokyo Tower as it rises steadily above the skyline
        during construction in 1958.</image:caption
