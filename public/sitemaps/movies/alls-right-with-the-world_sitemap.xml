        >The film explores the hidden face of poverty in one of the world's most
        affluent and capitalistic cities. Directed by CHEUNG King Wai (KJ: Music
        and Life), the film follows five Hong Kong families of different
        backgrounds that receive government subsidies. How do the poor get by in
        a glossy city that flaunts conspicuous consumption and hides poverty in
        cavernous public housing estates? All's Right With The World shares the
        different stories of these low-income families, their daily living
        conditions, and their ways of celebrating Chinese New
        Year.</image:caption
