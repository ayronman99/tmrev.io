        >Maria is a girl who loves to cook and lives with his grandmother, Doña
        Tere, in Mexico City's downtown. Doña Tere has a traditional Mexican
        restaurant called "El Molcajete". After the death of her daughter, Doña
        Tere abandoned his passion for cooking and stopped working in "El
        Molcajete", now operating under the direction of chef Rosi. Maria does
        everything possible to bring her grandmother back to the restaurant,
        while chef Rosi cooks dishes according to new trends in fusion cuisine
        which highlights the light food, but Maria and Doña Tere won't accept
        the traditional flavors and cooking secrets to be forgotten. The cuisine
        battle between Tere and chef Rosi is an epic fight not only between
        long-stablished mexican food and light food, but also a struggle of
        family bonds, friendship, cooking secrets, flavour’s passion and more
        than two hundred ingredients that are needed in order to prepare Mole, a
        traditional mexican sauce.</image:caption
