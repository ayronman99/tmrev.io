        >Sam Roddick explores the enduring appeal of Botticelli's masterpiece
        The Birth of Venus, one of the most celebrated paintings in western art.
        A joyous celebration of female sexuality, its journey to worldwide fame
        was far from straightforward and it lay in obscurity for centuries.
        Artist and entrepreneur Sam explains why Botticelli's nude was so
        revolutionary, and explores its impact on contemporary culture with
        artists such as Terry Gilliam, who memorably reinvented Venus for his
        Monty Python's Flying Circus animations.</image:caption
