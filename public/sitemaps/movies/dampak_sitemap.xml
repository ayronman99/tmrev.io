        >"Dampak" tells the story of five brothers, who are raised by a martial
        arts master in the village who teaches them his skills so that when they
        are older, they will be able to help him seek revenge on his archenemy
        who resides in the city. The time soon comes, and the five brothers
        travel to the city, but are they truly prepared for what's about to
        come?</image:caption
