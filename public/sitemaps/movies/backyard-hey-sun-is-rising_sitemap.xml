        >The film depicts a young man, or rather four young men, as they try to
        retain the sentimental feeling that is about to escape them when the sun
        comes up in the morning. In the expectations that they would never meet,
        they dressed up in the old military uniform and bathed in the morning
        sun. Their yawning drifts away with the wind; a wooden sword is the only
        attainable thing in their arms. The puppet-like laziness is shattered by
        the dancing sword, and they communicate in the anger of love and hate,
        but no real pain is ever felt. They attempt to capture the fiber of
        Peking Opera within the melody, but are accidentally brought above the
        city sky of their memories.</image:caption
