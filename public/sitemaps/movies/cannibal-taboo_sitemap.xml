        >Cannibal Taboo tells the story of Janet, a young woman raised in the
        wilds of Africa who is rescued by explorer Cliff Hendricks. When Cliff
        contracts a rare blood disease, Janet must leave her jungle ways to care
        for her husband and their four children. The bulk of the plot occurs
        when the youngest son, Paul, is about to have his twenty-first birthday.
        His brother Luke, a successful professor, returns for the celebration.
        However, things are not so simple in the Hendricks household, since
        fourth sibling Matthew disappeared on his twenty-first. Moreover, Paul
        and his sister have an incestuous relationship, and Janet is harboring a
        terrible secret.</image:caption
