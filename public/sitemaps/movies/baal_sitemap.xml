        >Volker Schlöndorff transposes Bertolt Brecht’s late-expressionist work
        to latter-day 1969. Poet and anarchist Baal lives in an attic and reads
        his poems to cab drivers. At first feted and later rejected by bourgeois
        society, Baal roams through forests and along motorways, greedy for
        schnapps, cigarettes, women and men: ‘You have to let out the beast, let
        him out into the sunlight.’ After impregnating a young actress he soon
        comes to regard her as a millstone round his neck. He stabs a friend to
        death and dies alone. ‘You are useless, mangy and wild, you beast, you
        crawl through the lowest boughs of the tree.’</image:caption
