        >Aparajito picks up where the first film leaves off, with Apu and his
        family having moved away from the country to live in the bustling holy
        city of Varanasi (then known as Benares). As Apu progresses from
        wide-eyed child to intellectually curious teenager, eventually studying
        in Kolkata, we witness his academic and moral education, as well as the
        growing complexity of his relationship with his mother. This tenderly
        expressive, often heart-wrenching film, which won three top prizes at
        the Venice Film Festival, including the Golden Lion, not only extends
        but also spiritually deepens the tale of Apu.</image:caption
