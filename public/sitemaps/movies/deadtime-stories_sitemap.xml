        >An anthology of three horror stories presented by George A. Romero. In
        "Valley of the Shadow," a woman searches for her missing husband in the
        jungles of South America, only to be in great danger herself. In "Wet,"
        a lonely man finds an empty box on the beach and opens it, with
        disastrous results. In "House Call," a doctor is called to a rural farm
        house to diagnose a strange ailment. This segment is a short film
        directed by Tom Savini in 2004 as a failed television
        pilot.</image:caption
