        >Unni is a share broker in Coimbatore and leads a comfortable life with
        his wife Latha and daughter Lakshmi/Lechu . Into the cosiness of such a
        living intrudes a strangerwho introduces himself as Jose. Cashing in on
        Unni's forgetfulness, Jose goads him into believing that he is Unni's
        7th grade classmate. However, a sense of insecurity pervades, with the
        unwelcome guest – alcoholic and somewhat eccentric – pitching for an
        extended stay. Unni's misgivings about the 'mystery man' and his
        ulterior motives proves true, when his confidant and classmate, Dr Alex
        Varghese (Murali Gopy), on consultation, reaffirms his doubts that they
        had no schoolmate in the name of Jose.</image:caption
