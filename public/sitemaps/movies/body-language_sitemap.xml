        >An hour before the five best Dutch dance crews fly to a contest in New
        York, the subsidized trip is cancelled. Five dancers from totally
        different crews don't want to give up their free plane ticket and go
        anyway. In New York they realize what they've done. They have no money,
        no plan and no crew. But... They came to dance so there is only one
        thing to do. Together they form a new crew and do everything they can to
        enter the contest they came for. In the mean time... they have to
        survive two weeks in New York without any cash. Written by Tijs van
