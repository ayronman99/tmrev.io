        >Though his story is largely unknown, Pedro E. Guerrero led a remarkable
        life photographing the work of some of the greatest artists in the world
        and as an integral part of the 1950s “Mad Men” advertising world.
        Guerrero grew up poor and the victim of segregation as a
        Mexican-American. But, when Guerrero was just 22, Frank Lloyd Wright
        took a look at his portfolio and made the spur-of-the-moment decision to
        hire him to photograph Taliesin West, Wright’s desert home. Guerrero
        rapidly became one of the most sought-after architectural photographers
        and, consequently, the era’s major interpreter of modernist architecture
        and sculpture. A Photographer’s Journey is as much a portrait of
        Guerrero as it is a panorama of the culture and art of his time. - Sandy
