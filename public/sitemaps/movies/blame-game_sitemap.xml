        >Martin Behrens is a Middle East expert for the German intelligence
        agency BND. He obtains information leading to a U.S. drone strike on a
        wanted terrorist in Zahiristan. A few days later, there's a terrorist
        attack on a restaurant – the video claiming responsibility calls it
        payback for the drone strike. Freelance journalist Aurice, with whom
        Martin was having an affair, is among the victims – she was
        investigating corruption at the heart of the BND. Martin soon has to
        realize that in a world where big corporations profit from arms deals as
        well as from homeland security contracts, good and evil are sometimes
        hard to tell apart.</image:caption
