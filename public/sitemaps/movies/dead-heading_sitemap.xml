        >When the flight attendant, Anna, arrives in London Heathrow after a
        long-haul flight from New York, she's exhausted and terribly irritable.
        Another bland hotel room just adds to her moody emotional state. A
        chance meeting with a good-looking man in the bar perks up her evening
        and the two quickly hook up for the night. When Anna wakes the following
        morning, she finds herself covered in blood and the man brutally
        murdered in her bed. Who did it? The circumstance put her in a difficult
        situation to call the police, but what is she going to do now? How do
        you get rid of a body trapped in a hotel room? Anna will race against
        time to put the pieces together to discover a terrible
        truth.</image:caption
