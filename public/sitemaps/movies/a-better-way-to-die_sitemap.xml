        >Boomer (Wiper) is a rookie cop based in the urban hellhole that is
        downtown Chicago. After his involvement in a drug bust operation which
        results in the death of Carlos (Carmen Argenziano), his mentor and
        father figure, Boomer becomes disillusioned with the brutal and inhumane
        nature of his job. Consequently, he decides to hand in his resignation
        to the Chicago Police Department and return to his home town of Joliet,
        where his fianc√©, Kelly (Natasha Henstridge), awaits.While en route back
        to Joliet, however, Boomer makes a grievous error in judgment when he
        stops for, and assists, an unfortunate motorist whose vehicle appears to
        have broken down; the naive ex-cop is swiftly attacked and rendered
        unconscious. Boomer awakes to find that his car and wallet have been
        stolen, and that he has become involved in a dangerous game of mistaken
        identity.</image:caption
