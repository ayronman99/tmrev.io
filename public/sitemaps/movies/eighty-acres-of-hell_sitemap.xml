        >Eighty Acres of Hell reveals that the Union was more than capable of
        matching the Confederates atrocity-for-atrocity. While 12,000 prisoners
        entered Camp Douglas, only 6,000 left. The rest were victims of
        calculated cruelty, torture and neglect. Southern soldiers were not the
        only targets of this treatment--many prominent Chicago citizens were
        incarcerated under the banner of martial law, unjustly convicted of
        imagined offenses by ruthless military tribunals. From the establishment
        of the camp to the terrible toll it ultimately took, Eighty Acres of
        Hell is a troubling look at a long-ignored chapter of the Civil
        War.</image:caption
