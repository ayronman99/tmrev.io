        >Terror reaches new heights when a gang of terrorists steals radioactive
        material from a nuclear power plant. Although they manage to escape by
        plane, the pilot is critically injured and they are forced to make an
        emergency landing. Presenting themselves as a commercial flight, they
        are granted access to a small private airport. Once on earth, the
        terrorists kidnap the owner, his daughter and the rest of the staff,
        forcing them to repair the plane and pilot it to finish the
        mission.</image:caption
