        >Cathy, 6, is taken by a social worker to a foster home in the
        countryside, where she slowly gets used to the strict rules imposed by
        her foster mother Réjeanne. Fortunately, her foster father, Reynald, is
        kind and gentle with the girl and patiently helps her break through her
        shell. Kayla, 12, is sent to a group home where she gets to know
        Morgane, a rebellious teenager who’s planning to run away. At about the
        same time, Manu is released from the system on the day she turns 18, but
        she finds it difficult to adjust to her solitary existence outside of
        the system. All four meet up at a reception honoring a foster family
        with whom they’ve all previously lived.</image:caption
