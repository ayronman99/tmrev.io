        >Raphael, a young executive who is on the verge of losing a multimillion
        dollar architectural deal with a large distribution company lead by the
        awkward Stanford(s). Raphael suffers a sudden death in his family and
        has to immediately leave to go to the funeral in his home town of
        Metzburgh. Seeing this as his big chance to get ahead is Wayne, a
        jealous co-worker who is in competition with Raphael. As Raphael returns
        to Metzburgh, he experiences a life changing event: witnessing a Grim
        Reaper taking a soul. This sighting results in Raphael becoming a Reaper
        and having to explore his own conscience and the lengths he will go to
        get his own life back. But Death, has other plans for the naive young
        executive.</image:caption
