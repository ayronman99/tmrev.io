        >To the Evuzok, a tribe in the South of Cameroon, there are two kinds of
        diseases that are cured different ways: the “natural” ones and the ones
        from the night world, caused by sorcery. Dance to the Spirits is the
        story of Mba Owona Pierre, the village chief and ngengan (healer). He
        deals with the sicknesses that come from the night world where spirits
        live and attack his people. Pierre has a special gift and a
        responsibility towards his fellow villagers. The dance to the spirits is
        his main healing ritual.</image:caption
