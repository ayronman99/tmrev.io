        >Koen is a fatherless, eighteen year old boy who wants to free himself
        from the suffocating relationship with his mother. He struggels with the
        balance between independency and love. When he meets Colet, he tries to
        keep his distance, but she is both anarchistic and audacious. She does
        not understand the fact that Koen does not have the slightest curiosity
        about his unknown father. It is because of her that he begins the search
        for his father.</image:caption
