        >The film tells the story of how Pan American World Airways kickstarted
        the Jet Age and shrank the globe. Real-life 'Pan Am girls' recall a
        high-life of luxury and glamour; rubbing shoulders with celebrity
        passengers, international romances and having to wear the now infamous
        girdle. Stars of the Jet Age such as Robert Vaughn and Mary Quant
        remember the food, fashion and girls that made them regular Pan Am
        passengers. Pan Am's success was largely due to its visionary founder
        Juan Trippe, who transformed a small mail carrier into a global airline,
        pioneered flights for the masses and helped create the Boeing 747 jumbo
        jet. Honor Blackman narrates the story of how Pan Am conquered the skies
        and left a legacy of affordable travel and a much smaller
        world.</image:caption
