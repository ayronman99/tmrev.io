        >Three women from different cities in Latin America, they simultaneously
        face the same challenge: an unexpected pregnancy. They do not know each
        other, but a golden and invisible thread links their lives. Their
        stories cross-relate and meet in different points, despite the distance.
        Each one in her own city, culture, and personal environment, will walk
        the streets, traversing fantasies, fears, desires and joys, looking for
        a door towards their new life, with as much glam our as they possibly
        can. A movie with many exhilarate and dramatic situations presented in
        an impeccable frame, driven by fashion, music, and a very feminine and
        sophisticated touch. Three accents, three colors, three kinds of sound,
        three cities. A movie as mandatory for women as wearing
        make-up</image:caption
