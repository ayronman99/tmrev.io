        >Chanti (Ravi Teja), a soldier, arrives at his village for his father's
        (Ranganath) funeral. He is bequeathed a huge property which he plans to
        use for his blind sister (Revathy). Unfortunately, the land happens to
        be between two proposed sites for a road in which the local MLA (Atul
        Kulkarni) has an interest, as it leads to his factory. He offers to buy
        it from Chanti, who refuses, citing it as a memorial of his father.
        Chanti's sister is married to Raja Ravindra (Raja Ravindra), Chanti's
        army friend. However, the MLA kills Raja. The rest of the story is how
        Chanti avenges his friend's and father's deaths and him getting married
        to his cousin Vasantha Laxmi (Charmme Kaur).</image:caption
