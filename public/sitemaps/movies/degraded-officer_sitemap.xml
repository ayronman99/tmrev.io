        >During 1943 a young platoon commander refuses to follow an order of
        frontal attack; he doesn't want to send his soldiers against the enemy
        machine-guns and get them killed. A battalion commander rips off his
        shoulder straps and sends him to the military tribunal. But the war is
        everywhere and the demoted officer and his escorts have to start an
        unequal fight with the enemy.</image:caption
