        >When the B horror movie CHAIN-FACE CLOWN was released in 1985, no one
        knew the film would one day become a classic, heralded as a cinematic
        tour de force - Well, at least by a select group of horror movie fans.
        The film's biggest fan, 29 year-old EMILY LYNESSA always knew she was
        going to meet and fall in love with JONATHAN BLAKLEE, mid 40s, the star
        of CHAIN-FACE CLOWN. For Emily, Jonathan is the perfect soulmate; no
        other male compares to him. She has idolized him and the film ever since
        she can remember. Emily has collection of CHAIN-FACE CLOWN memorabilia
        that would impress even the most ardent fan. But, there is one item she
        has yet to attain - The real life, breathing Jonathan
        Blaklee.</image:caption
