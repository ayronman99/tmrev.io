        >Thanks to an auto accident, a parasitic alien manages to get into a
        hospital. It quickly moves from the crash victim into a candy striper.
        Among the patients at the hospital are some rather short high school
        basketball players. It is through them that we watch the events unfold.
        The infected, or inhabited, candy striper becomes predatory. She goes
        after men for sex and after women to spread. Infected women develop an
        incredible sweet tooth and devour anything sweet they can find. The
        horror then spreads. As the horror takes over more of the hospital and
        the CDC locks it down, the basketball players and a few friends do
        everything they can to try and get out of the hospital. But soon it
        becomes evident that the problem has spread too far. Now if they manage
        to escape it will only be to delay the inevitable if they cannot halt
        the spread of aliens before they get out and take over the whole
        world.</image:caption
