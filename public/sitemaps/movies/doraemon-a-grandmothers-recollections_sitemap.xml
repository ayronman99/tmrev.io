        >Nobita finds his old teddy bear among the trash after his mother
        partially cleaned up their shed and tells her not to throw it away. The
        stuffed animal is a precious gift from his beloved grandmother.
        Reminiscing about her makes Nobita ask Doraemon to take him back to when
        he was still three years old and his grandma was still alive.
