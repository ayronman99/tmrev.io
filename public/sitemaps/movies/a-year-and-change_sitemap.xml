        >After falling off the roof at a New Year's Eve house party, Owen
        decides that it's time to make some wholesale changes in his life. Over
        the next year, he quits drinking, re-enters his estranged son's life,
        reignites old friendships, and falls in love with Vera, a bank teller
        and fellow divorcee...all in an attempt to replace members of his family
        who he'd lost prematurely.</image:caption
