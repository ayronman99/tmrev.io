        >Michel works there manically solving people's problems over the phone.
        He is about to tie the knot with his girl friend Isabelle, an airline
        hostess. She flies all over the world, he hates to leave the office. A
        series of madcap mishaps involving theft or injury (as you would expect
        in his line of work) ensues after Michel promises Isabelle nothing will
        delay their marriage and she promises in turn that she's done flying.
        Once this unlikely promise is made, it becomes premise and both are
        forced into escalating white lies to maintain the appearance of keeping
        their word. Their predicament mounts as Isabelle is forced to do a few
        more flights, while Michel is compelled to travel to New York, Tunisia,
        and finally Hong Kong, where they are finally reunited in the throes of
        a contrived and hilarious drug deal involving a 747, water taxi chases,
        and martial arts.</image:caption
