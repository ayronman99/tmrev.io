        >While waiting for their bus five passengers who have all just had
        horrible nightmares decide to tell them to each other to help kill time.
        A swimmer, who has lessons in a swimming pool with a dead swimmer, tells
        the first one. A young boy, who goes camping with two friends and has a
        crazy man as a leader, is next. Then a lonely woman, who has an
        infatuation with the anchor of a late night show, and finds that he is
        indeed a vampire. A young man, who finds he has the gift of bringing
        dead people back to life, brings a cold blood criminal back to life.
        Last, a skeptic professor of anthropology tells to his students about an
        evil native Mexican creature from the Middle Ages called "Ixpe", and a
        young woman embodies it. When the bus finally arrives they get a huge
        surprise.</image:caption
