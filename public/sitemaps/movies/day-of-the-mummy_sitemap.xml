        >Welcome to Egypt, land of the Pharaohs. A place steeped in history and
        legend; Gods and spiritual guides; untold wealth â€“ and the
        bone-cracking, blood-spilling guardians of its riches. Jack Wells has
        arrived in Egypt in search of the famous diamond known as The Codex
        Stone. His journey leads him to the tomb of the cursed King Neferu,
        cursed not by name but by nature. With his centuries-old slumber
        disturbed by timeless human greed, the King rises from the dead with a
        blood-lust that cannot be quenched and a raging fury that will shred
        flesh from bone, bringing terrible and tormented death to all who dare
        witness the Day of the Mummy.</image:caption
