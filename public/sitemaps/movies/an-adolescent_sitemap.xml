        >Tomokawa is a tough guy turned bored cop who spends much of his time
        sating lonely housewives and looking after retarded teen Sukemasa. One
        day while hanging out at a bar, he is approached by a 15-year-old enjo
        kosai named Yoko, offering a round of illicit sex in exchange for cash.
        Though he demurs, their paths cross again and soon a relationship of
        sorts forms. Yoko, it turns out, is Sukemasa's sister; and both are the
        children of his old flame Yukie, a grasping, self-centered woman.
        Moreover, Yoko's grandfather is responsible for the massive tattoo
        sprawling across Tomokawa's back. Tomokawa soon takes both teens under
        his wing, protecting them from their heartless mother, and their
        lecherous stepfather. Soon, Yoko gets a similarly massive tattoo
        illustrating her bond with her policeman savior.</image:caption
