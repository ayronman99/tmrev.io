        >15-year-old Aya Kito was an ordinary girl, the daughter of a family who
        works at a tofu shop, and a soon-to-be high schooler. However, odd
        things have been happening to Aya lately. She has been falling down
        often and walks strange. Her mother, Shioka, takes Aya to see the
        doctor. How will Aya react when told about her disease? And how will Aya
        live from now on?</image:caption
