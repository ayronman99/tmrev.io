        >Hoffa floats ashore in Estonia after his stolen getaway boat has
        exploded. He tries to begin a new life in Estonia, but the longing for
        his family back home becomes too big and he decides to get back to
        Sweden. Now a tough struggle begins to get himself home to the family, a
        family that has moved on with their lives and also thinks that he's
        dead. A past as a bank robber and a fugitive is not making the journey
        easier. Along the way back to Sweden more problems arise that makes it
        even harder for him to meet his family again. Meantime back in Sweden
        his family is struggling with difficulties which they don't know how to
        solve. The time is running out and things don't look good at
        all.</image:caption
