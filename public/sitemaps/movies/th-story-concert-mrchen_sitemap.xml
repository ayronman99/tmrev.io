        >Once upon a time, there was a woman named Therese von Ludowing who
        lived far from society in Thüringen with her son, März von Ludowing.
        But, Therese's reputation for her herbal remedies resulted with her
        being captured by two men in plague masks to be condemned a witch--due
        to the Black Plague occurring at the time. Although Therese attempts to
        fight them off when her son unknowingly brought the men to their hut,
        she is captured while März is tossed into the well outside their home,
        and she curses the world in her final breath before her execution. The
        following night, his once white hair stained black - "the color of dusk"
        - and no memory of who he was, the reborn Märchen von Friedhof emerged
        from the well after being awakened by a living doll named Elise. Elise
        compels Märchen to aid seven "princesses" in taking revenge in seven
        tales to achieve their own revenge. Each tale revolves around a deadly
        sin.</image:caption
