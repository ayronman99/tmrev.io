        >Looking for a baby-sitter for the night, Marc Schaudel entrusts his son
        Remy to the care of his employee Franck, a straight man. But the thing
        that Marc doesn't know, is that Franck is getting 30 years old this
        weekend and that his son Remy is a very capricious child. The next day,
        Marc and his wife Claire are awakened by a call from the police. Remy
        and Franck are missing, and the house is totally devastated. The police
        finds a camera in the leftovers. Marc, Claire and the police start
        watching the video that has been recorded the day before during the
        night and find out what happened to Franck and Remy.</image:caption
