        >The film follows the story of young teen April whose troubled life
        began in a dustbin - a new born baby, abandoned and alone, not
        celebrated, not wanted but discarded and left like so much rubbish in an
        industrial bin behind a pizza parlour. On the morning of her fourteenth
        birthday April has a devastating row with her foster mother, Marion and
        leaves the house determined to find out where she really comes from, who
        she really is and maybe, just maybe, find her real mother. Telling
        no-one what she's up to or where she's going, April skips school and
        begins the search she's dreamed about all her life. It's a blur of
        social workers, children's homes and special schools as April revisits
        and recalls the key scenes of her fragmented past. It's a painful
        journey, sometimes frightening but there's also friendship and love and
        laughter. And now she's started, there's no going back - April must find
        her mother.</image:caption
