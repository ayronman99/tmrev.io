        >Human beings are the kings of all animals, at least if you ask us
        humans. Our vanity is given something to mirror itself in, but does not
        escape without a scratch or two in this documentary, which observes a
        taxidermist, a deer farmer and a museum curator at work. Three jobs that
        have one thing in common: turning animals into aesthetic objects, alive
        as well as dead. When the work is done properly, it is impossible to
        tell the difference. Dead pets are mummified. At the zoological museum,
        the animals' glassy eyes stare back at us from the showcases. Even a
        plastic alligator has its natural place in the human master
        plan.</image:caption
