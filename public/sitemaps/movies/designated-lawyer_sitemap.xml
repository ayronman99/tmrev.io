        >Suspicions fall on politician Tagane Seizo over the sale of nationally
        owned land to a social welfare service corporation back in 2010. Seizo
        Tagane is then given immunity for his testimony, but people become
        furious that he was not going to be prosecuted. A committee of
        prosecutors meets and concludes that Seizo Tagane should be prosecuted.
        An outstanding lawyer Yui Hitotsugi takes the prosecutor's position in
        the case with the help of the prosecutor Tachibana.</image:caption
