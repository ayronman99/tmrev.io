        >Dad's in Heaven with Nixon is a 2010 documentary film produced,
        directed and written by Tom Murray. It concerns the history of the
        Murray family and especially of Tom's brother Chris Murray, a man with
        autism whose paintings of cityscapes, first promoted by family friend
        Gloria Vanderbilt, have garnered widespread praise. The title refers to
        Chris' belief that his late father, who loathed Richard Nixon, is now
        friends in heaven with the former president. Ranging over three
        generations of Murrays, whose patriarchs struggled with alcoholism and
        bipolar disorder, the film treats of subjects ranging from father-son
        relationships to the Great Depression, from the effects of divorce on
        families to the cushy lifestyle of the residents of Southhampton, New
        York.</image:caption
