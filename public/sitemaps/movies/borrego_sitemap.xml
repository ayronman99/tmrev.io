        >A young botanist relocates to a small desert town to study an invasive
        plant species. While out on research, she comes to the aid of a downed
        plane only to find herself taken captive by an inexperienced drug mule
        who forces her to lead a trek across the sweltering desert to his drop.
        A local sheriff is drawn into the hunt as his rebellious daughter sets
        out to find the missing botanist, all the while being pursued by a local
        drug receiver.</image:caption
