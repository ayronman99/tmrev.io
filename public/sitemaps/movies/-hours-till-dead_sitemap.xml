        >An AWOL soldier with PTSD goes into hiding along with his brother and a
        few friends. They retreat into a rural farm area unaware that the
        outside world has ceased to function. On their way back to civilization,
        his brother is attacked by an infected farmer. He quickly morphs into a
        rabid animal and lives for exactly three hours. Realizing they are in
        grave danger, they head back to the forest trying to outlive the legions
        of the infected.</image:caption
