        >Director Martin Scorsese speaks candidly and passionately about one of
        his formative filmmaking influences: the late Elia Kazan. Utilizing
        precisely chosen clips from Kazan's signature films including "On the
        Waterfront," "A Streetcar Named Desire," "Gentleman's Agreement," "Baby
        Doll," "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn," "A Face in the Crowd," "America,
        America," and "The Last Tycoon," and interview footage of the director
        himself, co-directors Scorsese and Kent Jones recount the director's
        tumultuous journey from the Group Theatre to the Hollywood A-list to the
        thicket of the blacklist. But most of all, they make a powerful case for
        Kazan as a profoundly personal artist working in a famously impersonal
        industry.</image:caption
