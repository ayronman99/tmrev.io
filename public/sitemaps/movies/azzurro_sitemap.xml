        >75-year-old Giuseppe De Metrio has spent 30 years in Geneva, as foreign
        worker for the Broyer company. Upon retirement, he returned to Puglia,
        Italy, where his family had continued to live. His only grandchild,
        7-year-old Carla, is blind. The whole family looks forward hopefully to
        the day when Carla's sight can be restored by means of a cornea
        transplantation. After a heart attack, Giuseppe decides to wait no
        longer and returns to Switzerland to ask his former boss Mr. Broyer for
        the money necessary for the operation, as an old promise binds the two
        men. Intended as a 48-hour trip, Giuseppe and Carla's visit in
        Switzerland becomes a journey that both grandfather and granddaughter
        never dreamt of...</image:caption
