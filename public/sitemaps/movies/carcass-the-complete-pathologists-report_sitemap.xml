        >The documentary features interviews, filmed in London and Liverpool at
        the end of 2007, with the members of extreme metal band Carcass Ken
        Owen, Bill Steer, Jeff Walker and Michael Amott. They discuss the story
        behind each of the bandâ€™s albums as well as their development from
        gore-soaked grind beginnings to the more refined melodic moments of
        their later output. Included with the Complete Pathologist's Report
        boxset of Carcass album reissues.</image:caption
