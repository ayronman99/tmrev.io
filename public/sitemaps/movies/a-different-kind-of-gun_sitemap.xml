        >"The reason why they kill people is because they do not have any
        education," a Sudanese boy says about the bloody conflict in his
        fatherland. Shortly before, we see images of a bombed school. In this
        film, the youngest and most innocent generation of Sudanese explains how
        it deals with the war that is tearing the country apart. Will the
        orphaned children avenge their murdered parents, or will they forgive
        the killers and start working on a new life? At any rate, these
        children's dreams for the future are anything but violent. One of them
        wants to learn English to be able to liberate his country, another wants
        to study to "be something," a third wants to become president to bring
        total peace, and yet another simply wants to be like her grandmother.
        Despite all the atrocities they have witnessed, the children mainly want
        to rebuild things, to put an end to the destruction.</image:caption
