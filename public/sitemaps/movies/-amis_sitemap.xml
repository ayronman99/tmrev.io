        >Three childhood friends support each other through life's ups and downs
        in this comedy/drama. Each goes through a difficult time in their life,
        and is "helped" by the others - always well-intentioned, but not always
        with the intended results! Baptiste's (Kad Merad) wife leaves him and he
        becomes depressed then obsessive-compulsive. César (Pascal Elbé) has a
        secret affair with his boss's daughter - he's nervous about seeing her
        in case dad finds out, but if he stops seeing her she threatens to tell
        all anyway - either way his job is on the line. Claire (Mathilde
        Seigner), adopted as a baby, struggles to decide whether to try and find
        her birth-mother.The links between the three play a crucial part in each
        of their lives - a deep and supportive bond, but one which risks
        preventing them ever forming a relationship with someone
        else.</image:caption
