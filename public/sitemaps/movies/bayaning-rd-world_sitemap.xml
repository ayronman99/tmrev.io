        >Two filmmakers try to create a film venturing on the life of Jose
        Rizal. Before they do that, they try to investigate on the heroism of
        the Philippine national hero. Of particular focus is his supposed
        retraction of his views against the Roman Catholic Church during the
        Spanish regime in the Philippines which he expressed primarily through
        his two novels Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo. The investigation
        was done mainly by "interviewing" key individuals in the life of Rizal
        such as his mother Teodora Alonso, his siblings Paciano, Trinidad, and
        Narcisa, his love interest and supposed wife Josephine Bracken, and the
        Jesuit priest who supposedly witnessed Rizal's retraction, Fr. Balaguer.
        Eventually, the two filmmakers would end up "interviewing" Rizal himself
        to get to the bottom of the issue.</image:caption
