        >Achim Bornhak's movie focuses on the restless life of Uschi Obermaier,
        the icon of the 1968 movement in Germany and groupie. At the age of 16,
        Uschi is bored by her job in a photo lab, but soon becomes the "it girl"
        of Munich's club scene. When she gets to know Rainer Langhans, they move
        to Berlin and live in "Kommune 1", the first politically-motivated
        commune in Germany. While the other occupants claim she isn't political
        enough, Uschi just wants to have fun, works as fashion model and leads
        international music stars in temptation.</image:caption
