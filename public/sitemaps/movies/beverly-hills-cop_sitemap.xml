        >The heat is on in this fast paced action-comedy starring Eddie Murphy
        as Axel Foley, a street smart Detroit cop tracking down his best
        friend's killer in Beverly Hills. Axel quickly learns that his wild
        style doesn't fit in with the Beverly Hills Police Department, which
        assigns two officers to make sure things don't get out of hand. Dragging
        the stuffy detectives along for the ride, Axel smashes through a huge
        culture clash in his hilarious, high-speed pursuit of justice. Featuring
        cameos by Paul Reiser, Bronson Pinchot and Damon Wayans, Beverly Hills
        Cop is an exhilarating, sidesplitting adventure.</image:caption
