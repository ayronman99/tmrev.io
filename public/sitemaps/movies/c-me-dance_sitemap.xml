        >A teenage dancer in training for the Los Angeles ballet discovers that
        she is dying of cancer, only to discover that the Devil is real after
        getting the miracle that she and her father both prayed for. Shortly
        after discovering that her dream of joining the Los Angeles Ballet has
        come true, 17-year-old Sherri (Christina DeMarco) receives a devastating
        report from her doctor: she's dying of cancer, and her days among the
        living are numbered. Falling back on their faith, Sherri and her father,
        Vince (Greg Robbins), begin to pray. One night, following an extensive
        prayer session, a miracle occurs. But the Devil (Peter Kent) has taken
        note, and now he's determined to claim Sherri's soul though whatever
        means necessary.</image:caption
