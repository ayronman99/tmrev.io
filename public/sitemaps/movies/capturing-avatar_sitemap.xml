        >Capturing Avatar is a feature length behind-the-scenes documentary
        about the making of Avatar. It uses footage from the film's development,
        as well as stock footage from as far back as the production of Titanic
        in 1995. Also included are numerous interviews with cast, artists, and
        other crew members. The documentary was released as a bonus feature on
        the extended collector's edition of Avatar.</image:caption
