        >Cryptozoology, a field known for its inquiries into unknown creatures
        like the Bigfoot and Loch Ness Monster, constitutes a challenge to
        exclusive hierarchies of knowledge and established scientific authority
        by presenting alternative theories and new taxonomic models. Recently,
        perhaps adversely influenced by information-addiction, many Bigfoot
        aficionados have dismissed “blobsquatches” (photos too blurry to be
        discernible as sasquatches) as an impediment to serious cryptozoological
        research. In this paranormal polemic, scientific jargon and genre tropes
        of investigative documentary are short-circuited and re-wired. The
        Blobsquatch is engaged critically to explore spaces between information
        and noise, obsolescence and adaptive re-use.</image:caption
