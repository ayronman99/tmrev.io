        >In January 1963, British journalist Leo Cauffield suddenly disappears
        from his home in Beirut. His wife Sally knew that he was working
        part-time for British intelligence, but was not prepared to be told by
        the British embassy that they suspect he has defected to Communist
        Russia. As his wife puts together the pieces of the mysterious jigsaw of
        the past, tracking her passionate relationship with her husband and his
        history as former head of MI6â€™s counter-espionage section, her
        relentless search for the truth takes her to London, New York and
        finally Moscow.</image:caption
