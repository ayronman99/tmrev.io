        >Four characters are looking for a man called Castro, but we don't know
        why. For some mysterious reason, Castro is running. He has left his life
        behind, and survives by hiding in a room in a small city. He is
        basically alone, but someone has appeared in his life, Celia. She is
        young, beautiful, and sometimes cruel.</image:caption
