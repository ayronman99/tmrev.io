        >Twice different. Five immigrants in Germany tell there stories. Do they
        feel different because they are from another country? Do they feel
        different, because they are lesbian or gay? Are they discriminated
        against because of their sexual orientation or because of their skin
        color? Or are theses issues not nearly as dire and drastic as others
        might think? In the end each story gives a different
        answer.</image:caption
