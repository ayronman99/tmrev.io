        >Ki-bong is a man who suffered brain damage as a child and who has the
        emotional maturity of an 8-year. The village people call him 'Barefoot
        Ki-Bong' because he runs barefoot with food he has begged and serves his
        mother before it gets cold. Running is Ki-Bong' greatest skill. It is
        his mother that Ki-bong loves the most. Ki-bong decides to take part in
        the National Amateur Half Marathon' in order to buy artificial teeth for
        his mother with the prize money, and works hard looking forward to the
        day of the race. Mr. BAEK, the head of the village, volunteers to be
        Ki-bong's trainer. The village people realize what family and love
        between family members mean to them when they see Ki-bong, who is
        considered a non-entity, working hard for the competition. The village
        gets changed by the efforts of Ki-bong and Mr. BAEK.</image:caption
