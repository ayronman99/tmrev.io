        >18 years on from the devastating impact of 2004's tsunami, the world
        still fights to come to terms with this devastating environmental
        disaster. Little does humanity know that it is about to face the
        ultimate peril; a monumental death wave annihilating everything in its
        wake. With the threat of another catastrophic tsunami, Prime Minister
        Tribhop sets up a national disaster alarm centre. His political future
        and the lives of his people depend upon the decisions he makes. But no
        one predicts the enormity of what is about to rise from the Thai Gulf.
        And no one can out run it this time. The Death Wave is
        coming</image:caption
