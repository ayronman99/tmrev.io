        >How far would you go to get the person of your dreams? With the help of
        Gwen and Tiffani, Kyle pretends to be heterosexual in order to land
        Troy, the new guy (and nude model) who's turning the heads of both men
        and women. He soon finds himself joining the campus ex-gay support group
        and nabbing a girlfriend! Kyle's ex-boyfriend Marc is horrified at the
        plan and decides to pursue the confused Troy with his own tactic --
        being his "out" gay self. Who will win Troy first?</image:caption
