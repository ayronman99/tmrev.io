        >Takanosuke Ushio and Tae Horikawa are unable to forget each other, even
        though they met and fell in love 20 years ago. They had promised each
        other that they would build a retreat in Shiguretei, but Ushio was
        hospitalized after a stroke a few days later, and when his wife, Takako,
        rushed to the hospital, she discovered their love affair, which in
        reality had not gone beyond kissing. Now, 20 years later, against the
        advice of her ikebana mentor, Tae rushes to meet Ushio at Shiguretei,
        only to see him clutching his chest in pain. Eventually, the design and
        plans for the dream retreat are seen by Tae, but she has to visit Kyoto
        alone... or maybe she's heading for somewhere else.</image:caption
