        >Although a lowlander, Marco is a robust fellow. He is now working as a
        farmhand for mountain farmer Alois in a remote Swiss alpine village and,
        even at the regulars’ table at the local inn, people are slowly learning
        to appreciate this iced tea drinker. Anna is a local village girl; she
        has a daughter, Julia, from a previous relationship. Some doubt whether
        this new relationship will work out – but not Marco or Anna. They get
        married. Their love is gentle and beautiful; unable to fully fathom it,
        they express it in simple words. The trust between them grows and their
        tenderness endures; the happiness they feel at every touch is only
        surpassed by the warmth of stroking a cow. But soon Marco seems to be
        losing control of his impulses more and more often.</image:caption
