        >Law enforcement officers Adam Mitchell, Nathan Hayes, and their
        partners stand up to the worst the streets have to offer with confidence
        and focus. Yet at the end of the day, they face a challenge that none of
        them are truly prepared to tackle: fatherhood. They know that God
        desires to turn the hearts of fathers to their children, but their
        children are beginning to drift further and further away from them. When
        tragedy hits home, these men are left wrestling with their hopes, their
        fears, their faith, and their fathering. Can a newfound urgency help
        these dads draw closer to God... and to their children?</image:caption
