        >A day in the life of a mother and her daughter, who have already
        reached a stage in life where their age difference is barely noticeable.
        One day, the two are visited by a young official who quite unwittingly
        makes the mother feel young again, and so she decides to set out for a
        walk by the river together with her daughter. It becomes increasingly
        clear to both of them that the best days of their lives are past and
        that they make a ludicrous impression wherever they go. However, they
        somehow keep their spirits up and try to enjoy this last walk together.
        They both know that this is the very last of the ‘grand days’ of their
        lives.</image:caption
