        >Laruang Lalake is a realist film that portrays the workers within the
        Filipino gay film industry and their personal stories - from the naughty
        to the gritty, from the horny to the hopeful. The film weaves the
        journey of ambitious probinsyano actor Samuel, Marc the idealistic film
        crew member who is secretly in love with Samuel and Wilredo a filmmaker
        on the brink of bankruptcy. And then there is also Peejay who is
        determined to steal a name for himeslf. As the camera grinds between
        naked bodies in homerotic play, its all in a day's work for eveyone
        living in a society that is yet to acept the Filipino gay
        man.</image:caption
