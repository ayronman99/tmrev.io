        >"Greetings fellow Filthlings…⁣ ⁣ After the glorious success of our
        livestream extravaganza back in May last year, we have decided to
        undertake a second in which we will play our legendary musical excretion
        ‘𝗗𝘂𝘀𝗸… 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗛𝗲𝗿 𝗘𝗺𝗯𝗿𝗮𝗰𝗲’ in its dark cinematic entirety, accompanied by a
        further bout of new album tracks and fan-favourites. ⁣ ⁣ Being unleashed
        on March 20th 2022 -the day of the Spring Equinox- and known as ‘𝙏𝙝𝙚
        𝙄𝙣𝙛𝙚𝙧𝙣𝙖𝙡 𝙑𝙚𝙧𝙣𝙖𝙡 𝙀𝙦𝙪𝙞𝙣𝙤𝙭’, this full live-stream ritual will also premier
        the incredible third single video from ‘𝗘𝘅𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗜𝘀 𝗙𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗹𝗲’ plus will
        include the entirety of our first livestream free for your vulgar
        delectation. ⁣ ⁣ So, Children of the Night, be expectant of horrific
        spectacle, big production and razor sharp Black Metal mayhem ascending
        your way.⁣ ⁣ Warning. This one-off special performance is intended
        solely for those tortured souls still clinging to the last of winter’s
        grip. ⁣"</image:caption
