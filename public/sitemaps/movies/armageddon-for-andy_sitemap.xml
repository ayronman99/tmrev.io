        >From the first day of kindergarten, Andy knew he was going to take
        Bethany Hopkins to the senior prom. The only problem is: he never
        bothered to tell Bethany. In fact, Andy's never even spoken to her. But
        with the prom only twenty-four hours away, he's not going to let a
        little thing like that get him down. He's got bigger problems. Mainly
        the fact that America is on the brink of a nuclear war that not only
        threatens to destroy the free world, but his prom night as
        well.</image:caption
