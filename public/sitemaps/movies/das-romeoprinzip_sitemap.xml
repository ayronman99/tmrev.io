        >Tom does not have it easy. At the student theater, his friend Jan and
        his beloved Annelie play the leading roles; the inconspicuous Tom, on
        the other hand, makes the prop. When he realizes that he must finally
        take his life, and especially love, into his own hands, he turns to his
        janitor, Mr Müller. What Tom does not know: Müller was once a
        psychologist of the Stasi! In the so-called "Romeo" program, he prepared
        male agents to address women in Germany and make them available as a
        source.</image:caption
