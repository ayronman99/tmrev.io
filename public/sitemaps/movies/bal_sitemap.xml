        >This piece is based on several works by Fernand Léger, particularly a
        painting from 1920 entitled Les disques de la ville, and his
        epxerimental film Ballet Mécanique (1924). So in this work I first goth
        through a phase of sampling ; the collected pictures are then reworked
        by means of new media. I was looking for a paradoxal picture, regarding
        its temporal situation. Léger's film 20s grain is still visible, though
        interferring with frame effects which can be clues about numerical video
        tools. This can evoke bad encoding, "low-fi" pictures that we get used
        to by watching video hosting websites such as YouTube or DailyMotion.
        There we get some kind of uchronia, like time collapsing on itself. Some
        kind of spontaneous meeting of Léger's Modernism with psychedelism,
        YouTube and pirate TVs. The soundtrack is made of trains and stations
        recordings — trains being so dear to the Futurists — and popular songs
        from the 20s.</image:caption
