        >For her first television film – a remake of Fassbinder’s Die bitteren
        Tränen der Petra von Kant – director Vera wants the perfect cast. But
        the first day of shooting is fast approaching and the numerous casting
        sessions have yet to find a suitable actress to play the leading role.
        Although the producer and crew are getting ever more exasperated with
        Vera, Gerwin is happy about the extra work, as he earns his money as an
        audition reader, delivering the lines of dialogue to the starry
        candidates at the various castings. When the male lead suddenly has to
        back out, Gerwin thinks that this might just be his
        chance.</image:caption
