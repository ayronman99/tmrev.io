        >I will call you! So you better answer your phone! In the year 2020, a
        homestay is being conducted for male and female teenagers in preparation
        for a union between North Korea and South Korea. North Korean girl
        Ha-jin goes to South Korean boy Woo-yeong's house to homestay. Woo-yeong
        starts to bully Ha-jin who has taken his room, but alas! First love has
        found its way to these children. Woo-yeong runs away to Seoul with
        Ha-jin to help her meet her father.</image:caption
