        >In 1987 Dublin was the focus of the world music scene. U2 were huge.
        Music scouts flocked to Ireland in their quest to find the next big
        thing. They didn't bargain on finding Aidan Walsh - comedian,
        entrepreneur and self-proclaimed master of the universe! Aidan Walsh
        first came to the nation's attention when he signed the quickest record
        deal in pop music history. All it took was a three-minute rendition of
        the Hokey Cokey. His rise as Ireland's unlikeliest pop star coupled with
        his painful search for family is a unique and bizarre story. From his
        troubled childhood in a Cork orphanage to his rise as Ireland's most
        eccentric underground character.</image:caption
