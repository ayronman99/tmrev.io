        >In 1994, in Toronto, the vampire Boya awakens from his twenty-five
        years of sleep in a basement hit by a golf ball. He takes a cab to the
        local cemetery, retrieves his belongings from a grave and lodges in a
        low budget hotel nearby an all-night donut shop. Boya does not drink
        human blood anymore but rats and pigeons blood instead. While in the
        donut shop, Boya befriends and protects the taxi driver Earl, who is
        having trouble with two criminals, and falls in love for the waitress
        Molly. Meanwhile, his former passion of 1969, Rita, who misses her lost
        youth, is trying to locate him.</image:caption
