        >Passive Aggressive is both a line from one of my bits, and it's an
        overall commentary on my way of pushing back against these societal
        norms that I feel inner obligation to live by. We're not like they told
        us we were supposed to be and we're not wrong. What they told us was
        bullshit. We can do whatever makes us happy and it doesn't matter who
        looks down on us. We'll look down on them just as hard. Really? You're
        24 and you're already married with 2 kids? Kill yourself.</image:caption
