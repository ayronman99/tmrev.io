        >Born in a village in Sudan, kidnapped by slavers, often beaten and
        abused, and later sold to Federico Marin, a Venetian merchant, Bakhita
        then came to Italy and became the nanny servant of Federico's daughter,
        Aurora, who had lost her mother at birth. She is treated as an outcast
        by the peasants and the other servants due to her black skin and African
        background, but Bakhita is kind and generous to others. Bakhita
        gradually comes closer to God with the help of the kind village priest,
        and embraces the Catholic faith. She requests to join the order of
        Canossian sisters, but Marin doesn't want to give her up as his servant,
        treating her almost as his property. This leads to a moving court case
        that raised an uproar which impacts Bakhita's freedom and ultimate
        decision to become a nun. Pope John Paul II declared her a saint in the
        year 2000.</image:caption
