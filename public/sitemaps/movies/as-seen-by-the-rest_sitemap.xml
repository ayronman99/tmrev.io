        >Malpe, a small fishing town on the Arabian Coast. Located 6 kms to the
        west of the temple town, Udupi. Malpe's beaches are washed clean
        everyday by the sea. The waves ensure that nothing gets left behind on
        the sands. But then, the waves cannot reach everything. It is the time
        of the year when Udupi and its surroundings are decked up to celebrate
        Sri Krishna Janmaashtami. Men and children walk the streets dressed up
        as characters from mythology. Teams painted as tigers are seen dancing
        to drum beats all around the town. But violence seems to be brewing in
        Malpe this Krishna Janmaashtami.</image:caption
