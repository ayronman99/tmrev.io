        >A group of longtime friends converge on a fatal course with destiny
        when they cross paths with Alexander Tatum, a mercenary surgeon. He is a
        hunter with the keen skill of one who has also been hunted. Prey turned
        predator. The victims quickly realize that Alexander is just the
        beginning of their problems, as they find themselves enmeshed in a fight
        for survival against a sociopath business man and his demonic staff, who
        will stop at nothing to prevail in the sale of Black Market Body
        Parts.</image:caption
