        >Faced with the emptiness and lack of rational explanation for many of
        the problems of the contemporary world, it sometimes seems that the only
        solution is to take refuge in the instincts ... and instincts lead us to
        sex. At least this is the exit that find the protagonists of this story:
        sex as a shock to stay alive, the manipulation of others as a way to
        ward off impotence and reaffirm their personalities torn by loneliness.
        But the result is ephemeral and the attempt has unforeseen
        consequences.</image:caption
