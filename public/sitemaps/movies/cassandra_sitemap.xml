        >Are words, photographs and speeches sufficient means for describing and
        communicating a complex, harsh, unmanageable reality? These unsolved
        questions pursue Cassandra during her trip through the impenetrable
        Chaco as chronicler of a means of communication, her first job after
        graduating from literature school. The unknown reality of native peoples
        who live in the Chaco communities, their beautiful and uncomprehensive
        languages and their dilemmas facing an economy which excludes them, are
        part of a trip in which Cassandra finds an inhabitable world within her
        status as foreigner. Her visions start merging with the cosmovision of
        ancient inhabitants until she becomes part of the enigma
        herself.</image:caption
