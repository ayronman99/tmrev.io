        >When her seven-year-old son dies in a tragic road accident, a grieving
        mother, Jia En, seeks the help of her former caregiver, Mdm Seetoh, to
        bring back his soul so he can be always 'by her side.' However, after
        several strange and deadly occurrences in the house, Jia En begins to
        suspect that there is something amiss with the soul she has brought
        back. In discovering what has really happened, she unravels the horrific
        truth ... a truth which may cost her her life and the lives of those
        around her.</image:caption
