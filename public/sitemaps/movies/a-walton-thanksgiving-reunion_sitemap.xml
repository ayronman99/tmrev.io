        >The fourth Waltons reunion TV movie is set in the 1960s , with John-Boy
        still living in New York, trying to persuade his fianc√©e to marry him.
        Meanwhile, Ben and Cindy's daughter Virginia has died, and Cindy is
        finding life very lonely without her. She tells Ben that she would
        dearly love to adopt another baby, but Ben feels that it is not a good
        idea. Ben argues with his father about buying a new truck for their
        lumber company, but John keeps insisting that they can't afford it.
        Elsewhere, Erin now has three children and is separated from Paul. Her
        decision to start seeing another man causes some indignation among the
        other Walton family members. Ike and Corabeth become grandparents when
        Aimee has a daughter, while Elizabeth returns from Europe and reunites
        with Drew, her old beau.</image:caption
