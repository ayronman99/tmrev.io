        >Christmas is coming but Barbara is not happy. Not only has she lost her
        wedding ring but Jim has won on a scratch card she found down the back
        of the sofa whilst looking for the ring and has kept quiet about his
        hundred pounds winnings. Nor is he especially sympathetic about Dave's
        impotency problem, though the entire Royle family unite to help recently
        widowed Joe from next door enjoy a restaurant-style evening in their
        house with the equally scatty Philomena, whom he has met through a want
        ad. On Christmas Day Barbara lashes out at Jim for his laziness and
        juvenile antics - though his description of a busty barmaid cures Dave's
        problem. However she is in for a pleasant surprise when she discovers
        just how he spent his scratch card winnings.</image:caption
