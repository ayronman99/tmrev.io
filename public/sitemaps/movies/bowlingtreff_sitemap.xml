        >The “Bowlingtreff” is a bowling alley situated right in the centre of
        Leipzig opened in July 1987. At that time the quality of life in Leipzig
        and the whole GDR got worse. Houses collapsed because of poor
        conditions, public life and amusement was on a very low level. The
        “Bowlingtreff” was not merely an urban entertainment centre but a
        revolution in those days. Built with the help of hundreds of volunteers
        without permission of the state authorities in Berlin the building
        expresses a free and international architecture known as postmodernism.
        It is an architecture that was never seen before in Leipzig. Marble and
        parquet on the floor, a glass roof and beautiful pink pillars. The
        atmosphere was western as time witnesses remember it.</image:caption
