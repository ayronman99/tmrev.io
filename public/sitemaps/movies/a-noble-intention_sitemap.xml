        >1888: a luthier, Vedder, has to step aside when his home, opposite the
        recently completed Central Station in Amsterdam, must yield for the
        planned Victoria Hotel. His cousin Anijs, pharmacist in the Northern
        provinces of the Netherlands, has gotten into a fix after illegal
        medical practices, and is looking for a way out. For himself and his
        wife Martha, but also for a colony of poor peat cutters whom he promises
        a future in the United States. Committed - or is it pride? - the two of
        them think up a scheme from which they all will fully benefit. With
        tragic consequences.</image:caption
