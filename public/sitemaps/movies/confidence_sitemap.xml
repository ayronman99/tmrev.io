        >What Jake Vig doesn't know just might get him killed. A sharp and
        polished grifter, Jake has just swindled thousands of dollars from the
        unsuspecting Lionel Dolby with the help of his crew. It becomes clear
        that Lionel wasn't just any mark, he was an accountant for eccentric
        crime boss Winston King. Jake and his crew will have to stay one step

        debt.</image:caption
