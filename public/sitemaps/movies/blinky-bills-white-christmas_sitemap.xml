        >With Christmas just around the corner, everyone in Greenpatch is busily
        decorating the town square. Blinky Bill is up to his usual mischief and
        accidentally breaks Wombo's snowdome. To make amends, he decides to give
        Wombo a treat by creating a white Christmas in Greenpatch with real snow
        and a real Christmas tree. So Blinky and Flap begin a quest in search of
        the rare and mysterious Wollemi Pine Forest in order to cut down a tree
        for the village square in Greenpatch, while Splodge and Nutsy stay at
        home and, with a variety of outrageous experiments, try to create snow.
        Will they make snow it in time for Christmas Eve? Join Blinky Bill and
        his friends as they celebrate the magic of a traditional European White
        Christmas in the Australian Bush. Extraordinary!</image:caption
