        >2525 A.D. Man has colonized the stars. The wealthy and powerful implant
        their brains in cloned versions of themselves to gain immortality. As a
        side-effect, occasionally a clone develops mutant abilities. A
        clonehunter and his new partner have to track down a clone who threatens
        to destroy the planet unless the rich man he was cloned for gives him
        all his wealth.</image:caption
