        >Aravindan is an innocent, kind hearted but mentally challenged tailor
        working in a tailor shop. He has an exceptional talent for tailoring,
        especially ladies garments. His services are indispensable to the shop
        owner. The other tailors who can't match his talent pick on him and
        taunt him every chance they get. Aravindan is secretly in love with his
        childhood friend Anitha who is also his staunch supporter. Anitha's
        family see him as nothing more than a simpleton and a mere handyman and
        has no insecurities about letting Aravindan into their home. His growing
        desire for Anitha puts a strain on their friendship.</image:caption
