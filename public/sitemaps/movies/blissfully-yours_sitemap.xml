        >Min is an illegal Burmese immigrant living in Thailand who has
        contracted a mysterious painful rash covering his upper body. His
        girlfriend, Roong, and a middle-aged woman, Orn, take him to see a
        doctor. Min pretends that he cannot speak because he is not fluent in
        Thai and speaking would reveal him to be an illegal
        immigrant.</image:caption
