        >A strange disease is plaguing the city; classes are cancelled,
        businesses are closed, all is under a state of emergency. What at first
        seems like a normal flu quickly leads to blind rage and cannibalistic
        behavior. Narrowly escaping contamination, Eva and Sam, a young married
        couple, are forced to barricade themselves in their high-rise apartment
        despite the palpable tension between them. Now forced into isolation in
        their small living space, they struggle with their own frailty in a
        world that can only offer the worst horrors imaginable.</image:caption
