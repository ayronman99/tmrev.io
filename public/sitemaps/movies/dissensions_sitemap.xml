        >A greedy, compassion-less sister threatens and belittles an adopted
        trans-gender brother over inheritance... A wealthy, powerful business
        magnate suspects his Russian trophy wife of adultery but, there is much
        more to it...A male "player" shows his true colors and lives to regret
        it, or does he?...A retired Senator has a personal dilemma with a catch
        22 that could cost his son's career...A woman and her former lover have
        their past catch up with them, with dire consequences...A police
        detective and the prosecutor cross ethical boundaries...A celebrity
        impersonator taking advantage of women must answer to an angry grieving
        father...A female psychiatrist has an eye opening experience and warns a
        priest of impending doom: his. These are the disparate, private dramas
        that permeate and imbrue themselves within a gathering place called
        "Dissensions," a place where no one knows your name....or cares
        to.</image:caption
