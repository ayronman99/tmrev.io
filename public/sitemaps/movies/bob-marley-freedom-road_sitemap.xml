        >He was and is, without doubt, Jamaica's finest export and in this
        programme we can reveal for the first time the behind the scenes Bob
        Marley that only his closest confidantes could know. To understand more
        about this iconic Jamaican his long time girlfriend and Oscar nominated
        actress Esther Anderson describes in some detail along with exclusive
        unpublished home video footage, their life together at home in Jamaica
        and of their time spent in Hope Road, London. Of all the people who
        considered themselves closest to him, Esther was probably the person who
        knew more about the man's innermost thoughts and fears than any; so much
        was she in tune with him she even helped to write some of his hit
        records. Also featured is the last interview he would ever give in the
        UK when journalist Kris Needs questions him about his foot injury (the
        injury that would eventually kill him) plus many other topics about
        which Marley held strong views.</image:caption
