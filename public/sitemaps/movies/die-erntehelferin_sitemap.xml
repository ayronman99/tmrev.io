        >After escaping from the Sudeten German Marienbad, Clara, together with
        her widowed brother-in-law Johann and his four children, is quartered in
        a small Franconian village in 1946. In addition to hunger and poverty
        Clara burdens the tuberculosis of her six-year-old niece Heidi. To raise
        money for life-saving medicines, she works as a harvest helper at Gut
        Braunfels. Here she meets the estate manager Martin again, her great
        love she had to leave because of the children. Immediately it sparkles
        again between the two, but also the power-conscious squire has kept an
        eye on Clara.</image:caption
