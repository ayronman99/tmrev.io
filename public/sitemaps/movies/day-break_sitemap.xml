        >Since the Islamic Revolution in Iran, capital punishment is carried out
        according to Islamic law, which gives the family of the victim ownership
        of the offender's life. Day Break - based on a compilation of true
        stories and shot inside Tehran's century-old prison - revolves around
        the imminent execution of Mansour, a man found guilty of murder. When
        the family of the victim repeatedly fails to show up on the appointed
        day, Mansour's execution is postponed again and again. Stuck inside the
        purgatory of his own mind, he waits as time passes on without him,
        caught between life and death, retribution and
        forgiveness.</image:caption
