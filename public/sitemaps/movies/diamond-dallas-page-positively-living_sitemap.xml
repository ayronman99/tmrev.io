        >At age 35, DDP attempted to become a wrestler, something everyone told
        him was impossible. After years of hard work, DDP ended his career a
        three-time WCW World Heavyweight Champion. Since exiting the ring, DDP
        is now known the world over for his DDP Yoga, a life-changing exercise
        tool. DDP has mentored both Scott Hall and Jake Roberts to sobriety. A
