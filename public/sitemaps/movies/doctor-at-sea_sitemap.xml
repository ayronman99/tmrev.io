        >Since 1988 a curious Doctor Who event has been taking place. Almost
        unnoticed by fandom in general, Dan Harris has been quietly organising
        cruises around the coast of America with fans and stars from Doctor Who.
        This must surely be the most obscure and unique fan activity of all!
        Join the intrepid Reeltime crew as we board the good ship Fascination
        with Nicholas Courtney, Yee Jee Tso and Lisa Bowerman as it leaves Miami
        on it’s way across the Gulf of Mexico. Somehow in this totally unique
        video (between trips on a glass bottom boat and to the Mayan ruins at
        Tulum) we manage to… squeeze in a Writers Workshop with Gary Russell,
        Stephen Cole and Simon Gerard… chat to the stars and fans about why they
        signed up… and include highlights of previous cruises.</image:caption
