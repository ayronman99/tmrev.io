        >As the Palaces Burn is a feature-length documentary that originally
        sought to follow Lamb of God and their fans throughout the world, to
        demonstrate how music ties us together when we canâ€™t find any other
        common bond. However, during the filming process in 2012, the story
        abruptly took a dramatic turn when lead singer Randy Blythe was arrested
        on charges of manslaughter and blamed for the death of one of their
        young fans in the Czech Republic. What followed was a heart-wrenching
        courtroom drama that left fans, friends, and curious onlookers around
        the world on the edge of their seats.</image:caption
