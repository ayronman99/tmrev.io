        >For decades, thousands of patients were hospitalized forcibly, without
        diagnosis of mental illness, in an enormous hospice in the city of
        Barbacena, Minas Gerais, southeast of Brazil. There they were tortured,
        raped and killed without anyone caring about their fate. Famous
        journalists, in the 1960s and 70s, made reports denouncing the
        ill-treatment. None of them - as Daniela Arbex does now - could tell the
        whole story. Sixty thousand died. Some managed to survive. And they now
        tell a little about the terrifying history of the Cologne
        Hospital.</image:caption
