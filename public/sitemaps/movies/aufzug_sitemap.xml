        >The story is set some time in the past, or maybe some time in the
        future. Given a time-frame, we would say somewhere between the American
        moonwalk, and Coca- Cola's serious ambition to turn the moon into an
        advertising logo. Our central character, the young lift operator, is
        formed by experience into cynicism, detachment, and apathy. The story
        builds to its crescendo: of public outrage and state crackdown; the
        banality of commercial interest and the monumental rape of nature. Set
        in a large newspaper office, the Lift is a place of relative safety. But
        floor by floor, with each passenger in his or her tableau, the
        atmosphere of mayhem seeps in. Finally our young character leaves the
        situation, far-gone in hopelessness and disinterest.</image:caption
