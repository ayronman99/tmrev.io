        >Maura Mackenzie believes the world is hers to conquer. With her career
        as a concert pianist gaining momentum, it seems her beauty and talent
        will be strong enough to mask the demons that threaten to engulf her.
        But with an absent husband and two young daughters at home, her
        precarious sanity begins to unravel until one summer day, burning with
        manic energy, she makes a terrible mistake â€” a mistake that will change
        her life forever. The consequences for Maura are catastrophic: her
        ambitious husband runs for his life, taking the children with him,
        leaving Maura to lapse into a full-scale breakdown. Life as she knew it
        is now over. With the help of her father, Ian, Maura works to reclaim
        her life and waits for a miracle to bring her daughters home. But when
        the fates align, can the past be forgiven?</image:caption
