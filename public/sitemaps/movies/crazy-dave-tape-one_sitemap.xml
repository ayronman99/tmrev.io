        >Our first attempt at expressing cobra thought patterns in a form that
        won’t physically damage the neighbor’s house. It was actually created
        for our pal Crazy Dave (hence the name) and originally meant to be a
        joke between friends. He enjoyed it mainly because of certain
        pornographic situations, and also during this time our friend Arthur Jr.
        was sold to the Hell’s Angels for original plans to an underground city
        located beneath Mt. Baldy in Chuck Norris Ohio. We think this DVD tape
        is okay, but prison taught us we could do better….</image:caption
