        >Set in an alternate universe, the ancient capital of Kamakura is a
        vibrant town where fantastical creatures live alongside humans. Akiko is
        a cheerful publishing assistant who moves into town after marrying
        Masakazu, a popular mystery writer. Akiko is surprised by the unusual
        town but enjoys the new curiosities surrounding her. However, just as
        she was beginning to settle in, a trifling incident sweeps her spirit to
        the underworld too soon. Convinced that destiny has something else in
        store for his wife, Masakazu journeys into the underworld to bring back
        Akikoâ€™s spirit.</image:caption
