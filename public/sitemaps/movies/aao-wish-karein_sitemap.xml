        >12 year old Mickey's life was almost like a fairy tale, a beautiful
        family, best buddy 'Bonnie' and his angel on earth-Mitika. But one
        beautiful day Mickey's fairy tale is shattered into a million pieces. It
        was the day he realized he was an adopted child and his 23 year old
        angel Mitika called him a 'Kid'. Mickey was feeling so low that he
        wished for a miracle. He wished to become big. When he woke up the next
        morning his whole life changed. But is this miracle a blessing or a
        curse?</image:caption
