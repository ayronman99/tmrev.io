        >Tino Ponce operates Circo Mexico, which journeys across the Mexican
        countryside in search of paying customers. Wanting to please his father
        and continue the family business, Ponce has recruited his young children
        as performers while laboring night and day to maintain the circus's
        faltering financial fortunes. But a growing resentment brewing within
        his wife about their hardscrabble existence suggests troubles on the
        horizon. While documenting the brutal regimen of circus life, Circo also
        peels back the curtain on the Ponce family's inner dynamics, revealing
        generational divides and money worries that threaten to tear apart a
        marriage. Buttressed by indie-rock band Calexico's evocative score,
        Schock's film observes this family drama with a sympathetic but
        clear-eyed view of a vanishing way of life. And because Circo refuses to
        be sentimental in its handling of the material, the story's twists
        become all the more poignant</image:caption
