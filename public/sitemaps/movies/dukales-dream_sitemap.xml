        >In 2009, actors Hugh Jackman and his wife, Deborra-lee Furness,
        traveled to Ethiopia as ambassadors for World Vision Australia, one of
        the world's largest humanitarian aid organizations. As longtime donors,
        the Jackmans wanted to visit a World Vision community development
        project to see how rural communities were being empowered to eradicate
        poverty. While in the Yirgacheffe region, Hugh met a 27 year-old coffee
        farmer named Dukale, working to lift his family out of poverty. Spending
        time on Dukale's farm, Hugh learned first-hand about the value of fair
        trade coffee and clean cookstove technology. (C) Official
