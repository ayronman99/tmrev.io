        >After serving a two-year prison sentence for alleged drug dealing,
        26-year-old Garrett realizes his famous parents have all but disowned
        him. He is determined to re-unite with his 16-year-old brother Noah, and
        get his life back on track, using $ 30,000 in cash he had stashed away.
        Garrett soon discovers the money is gone, his parents are acting
        suspicious, and his brother has run away. He must make a choice to move
        on or risk his life saving his family.</image:caption
