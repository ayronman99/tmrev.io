        >THE LOTTERY OF BIRTH is the first in a three-part documentary series
        entitled 'Creating Freedom' exploring the relationship between freedom,
        power and control in Western democracies. The series draws together
        interviews with some of the world's leading intellectuals, journalists
        and activists to offer an alternative perspective on today's society and
        the future we're creating. We do not choose to exist, or the environment
        we grow up in. Our starting point in life is one of passive reliance on
        forces over which we have no control. THE LOTTERY OF BIRTH shows that
        from birth onwards our minds are a battleground of competing forces:
        familial, educational, cultural, and professional. The outcome of this
        battle not only determines who we become, but the society that we
        create.</image:caption
