        >"Africa Light" - as white local citizens call Namibia. The name
        suggests romance, the beauty of nature and promises a life without any
        problems in a country where the difference between rich and poor could
        hardly be greater. Namibia does not give that impression of it. If you
        look at its surface it seems like Africa in its most innocent and
        civilized form. It is a country that is so inviting to dream by its
        spectacular landscape, stunning scenery and fascinating wildlife. It has
        a very strong tourism structure and the government gets a lot of money
        with its magical attraction. But despite its grandiose splendor it is an
        endless gray zone as well. It oscillates between tradition and
        modernity, between the cattle in the country and the slums in the city.
        It shuttles from colonial times, land property reform to minimum wage
        for everyone. It fluctuates between socialism and cold calculated market
        economy.</image:caption
