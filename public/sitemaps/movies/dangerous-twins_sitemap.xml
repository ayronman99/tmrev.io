        >How would you feel when there is a spontaneous change in your husband's
        attitude? How would you feel when you realize the person you have always
        slept with is apparently not your husband? What happens when you try to
        enforce orderliness and sanity in an uncultured work environment? What
        would you do when a group of Con men suddenly zoom in on you as an
        associate in a deal you have no idea of? It all began as a simple plan
        but then things turn bitter and rancorous. Sit tight and enjoy this
        unfolding and captivating adventure of Taye Thomas (Ramsey Tokumbo Noah)
        or Kehinde Thomas (Ramsey Tokumbo Noah).</image:caption
