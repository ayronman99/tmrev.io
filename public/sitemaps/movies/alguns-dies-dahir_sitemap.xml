        >A family that lives in a population of just over ten thousand
        inhabitants and about thirty minutes from Barcelona, sees its everyday
        life shaken by the political events that take place in Catalonia during
        the months of September and October 2017. A story of maturation and
        care. A story of a family that learns to break up and separate without
        hurting each other and without causing trauma. A family that learns to
        understand the thoughts and attitudes of others as everything gets more
        and more tense outside their home. A family that does everything
        possible to talk and understand each other, because, deep down, they
        love and respect each other. A family that will find a way to forgive
        and heal the wounds produced throughout this process.</image:caption
