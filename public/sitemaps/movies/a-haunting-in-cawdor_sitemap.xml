        >In this tense tale of psychological terror, Vivian Miller (Young) is a
        young twenties woman who’s serving out her jail sentence at a work
        release program in the Midwest. Her 90 days of probation takes her to
        The Cawdor Theater, a dilapidated summer stock theater run by Lawrence
        O’Neil (Elwes). Lawrence, a failed Broadway director, is now reduced to
        staging amateur productions with young parolees and raging over the
        mistakes from his past. Vivian’s arrival in Cawdor starts a terrifying
        series of events that brings Lawrence’s secret past to the present.
        After Vivian views an old taped stage production of Macbeth, a force of
        evil is unleashed which soon turns its sights on her. With the help of
        Roddy (Welch), a local outcast, Vivian sets about trying to discover who
        the supernatural killer on the tape is before she becomes the next
        victim.</image:caption
