        >Chonda Pierce has done it again - given us a unique worldview that
        pulls at our heart strings one moment and raps on our funny bones the
        next. Only this time we get an eyeful too - yes, an eyeful. Because it's
        all about how Chonda sees things. So watch closely as, again and again,
        the ridiculous gives way to the sublime, and you realize the eyeful
        she's talking about doesn't come from wearing a wacky pair of glasses,
        but because she has moved you closer and closer to the very face of God.
        What an eyeful that is!</image:caption
