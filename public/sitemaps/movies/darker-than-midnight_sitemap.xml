        >Davide is different from the other teenagers. Something makes him look
        like a girl. Davide is fourteen when he runs away from home. His
        intuition leads him to choose Villa Bellini, a park in Catania, as a
        refuge. The park is a world in itself, a world of the marginalized, to
        which the rest of the city turns a blind eye. But one day the past
        catches up and Davide has to face the most difficult choice, this time
        alone.</image:caption
