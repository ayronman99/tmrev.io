        >This is a 60 minute independent critical review of Duran Duran on
        record, on film and in concert with commentary by Graham McTavish. The
        video draws on rare live film from the archives, and chronicles the band
        from the early days in the 1980s. The film features interviews with Mark
        Tinley and former co-manager Paul Berrow, the man who first signed the
        band to EMI. There are also interviews with a leading team of critics
        and musicologists to provide a penetrating insight into the music of
        Duran Duran, with live footage from The Sing Blue Silver Tour, plus TV &
        radio archives. The DVD contains only small video clips of Duran
        Duran.</image:caption
