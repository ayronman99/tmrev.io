        >A thrilling and inspiring true story begins on the eve of World War II
        as, within days of becoming Prime Minister of Great Britain, Winston
        Churchill must face one of his most turbulent and defining trials:
        exploring a negotiated peace treaty with Nazi Germany, or standing firm
        to fight for the ideals, liberty and freedom of a nation. As the
        unstoppable Nazi forces roll across Western Europe and the threat of
        invasion is imminent, and with an unprepared public, a skeptical King,
        and his own party plotting against him, Churchill must withstand his
        darkest hour, rally a nation, and attempt to change the course of world
        history.</image:caption
