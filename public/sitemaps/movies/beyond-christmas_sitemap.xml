        >This uplifting story begins on Christmas Eve in New York City as three
        elderly businessmen prepare to enjoy a festive dinner together. In a
        show of holiday spirit, they receive visits from two kind-hearted
        strangers; first a young man, then a young woman. Each has come to
        return a wallet they believe one of the gentlemen has lost. From this
        humble beginning, friendships are built, and romance ensues. The elderly
        gentlemen meet with a tragic mishap in a blizzard, returning to earth as
        benevolent ghosts who act as the young couple's guardian angels. Before
        proceeding to Heaven, the spirits work behind the scenes to ensure that
        the couple's love will endure forever. Filled with heart and soul, this
        charming 1940 holiday classic is perfect for the Christmas season and
        beyond.</image:caption
