        >A Crime on the Bayou is the story of Gary Duncan, a Black teenager from
        Plaquemines Parish, a swampy strip of land south of New Orleans. In
        1966, Duncan tries to break up an argument between white and Black
        teenagers outside a newly integrated school. He gently lays his hand on
        a white boy’s arm. The boy recoils like a snake. That night, police
        burst into Duncan’s trailer and arrest him for assault on a minor. A
        young Jewish attorney, Richard Sobol, leaves his prestigious D.C. firm
        to volunteer in New Orleans. With his help, Duncan bravely stands up to
        a racist legal system powered by a white supremacist boss to challenge
        his unfair arrest. Their fight goes all the way to the U.S. Supreme
        Court, and their lifelong friendship is forged.</image:caption
