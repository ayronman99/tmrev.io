        >The collective military operations from D-Day to the final assault on
        Germany represent one of the greatest military offensives ever. D-Day to
        Berlin follows the Allies' remarkable progress from the beaches of
        Normandy to their ultimate victory just eleven months later. The
        celebration of Europe's liberation from the Nazis was tempered only by
        the chill of Stalin's new domination, truly making this the campaign
        that shaped the future of Europe. Using a testimony-driven format, this
        three-part series uses accounts of British, American and German
        soldiers, as well as archive footage, to bring the savage battlefields
        to life once more.</image:caption
