        Productions & Global Creatures’ present their Olivier Award-winning
        production, A Monster Calls. Thirteen-year-old Conor and his mum have
        managed just fine since his dad moved to America. But now his mum’s very
        sick and she’s not getting any better. His grandmother won’t stop
        interfering and the kids at school won’t look him in the eye. Then, one
        night, at seven minutes past midnight, Conor is woken by something at
        his window. A monster has come walking. It’s come to tell Conor tales
        from when it walked before. And when it’s finished, Conor must tell his
        own story and face his deepest fears. On publication, A Monster Calls
        became a bestseller with children and adults alike with its dazzling
        insight into love, loss and healing. It garnered huge critical acclaim,
        including an unprecedented double win of the Carnegie and Greenaway
        Medals for outstanding children’s literature and
        illustration.</image:caption
