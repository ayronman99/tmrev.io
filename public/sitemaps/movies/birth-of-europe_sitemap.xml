        >This 3 episode series details the epic story of the origin of Europe -
        a place with a surprisingly diverse nature stretching from the snowy far
        north to the coast of Africa. Defined by volcanoes, ice ages, the
        collision of continents and even asteroids, the legacy of human history
        masks its awe-inspiring geological past. Born in the early days of the
        Earth, Europe is constantly being affected by the powerful forces of
        Mother Nature. It was forged in the fire and crushed by the collision of
        continents, carved by water and fire.</image:caption
