        >Twenty years ago Marco's father was brutally murdered by a cold-blooded
        serial killer known as the Crazy Dog. Since then, he has been
        ceaselessly trying to unveil the chain of events that have resulted in
        dad's death. Marco contacts Raul Chinna, a well-known criminologist that
        has made the Dog's bloody legacy his very own field of expertise. As
        soon Marco and Chinna start to recall the past, they both have to face
        the fact there is another man obsessed by the murders of Crazy Dog:
        David Moiraghi, a journalist who's been working for decades on the
        serial killer. As the truth starts slowly to emerge from the mists of
        time, Marco has to acknowledge that there is maybe something more that
        links professor Chinna and Moiraghi. The thin line between truth and
        fiction starts slowly to blur while Marco is forced once again to face
        his worst nightmares all over again.</image:caption
