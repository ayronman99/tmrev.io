        >One of the top wordsmiths in Canto-pop, Wyman Wong made pop history in
        February 2012 with a series of six sold-out concerts at the Hong Kong
        Coliseum to celebrate and showcase his illustrious career of 18 years
        and counting. These star-studded concerts featured Wyman's best works,
        chosen from his extensive repertoire by the man himself, and performed
        by over 40 guest singers - from the hottest stars to the very rare
        appearances like Amanda Lee, Shine, and Cass Phang - who showed up in
        designer costumes under the fashion-savvy lyricist's direction. Now you
        can relive such a sumptuous feast for the senses that is Concert YY on
        this 3-Blu-ray set, complete with 88 songs and a total running time of
        over six hours!</image:caption
