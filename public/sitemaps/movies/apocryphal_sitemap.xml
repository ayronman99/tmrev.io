        >Bewildered, Carlos awakens from a nightmare stalked by Death. The dream
        has a foreboding message, which is not entirely clear to him. Carlos
        decides to challenge his destiny and face the consequences, but his evil
        doing ends up shaping his own fate and that of those around him. Macabre
        by choice, Carlos attempts to tip the scales by changing the course of
        the plot designed by the gods. In this story,the unsettling city of
        Mexico is the backdropthat reveals psychological and human postures
        characteristic of a big city. It is a story where individuals who change
        their destiny with masks and opportunism manipulate morality, religion
        and reason for selfish personal gain.</image:caption
