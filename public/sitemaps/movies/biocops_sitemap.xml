        >CIA Agent Harry is bitten by a man who was part of a deadly experiment
        involving the ability to withstand pain. The bacterium has a virus,
        causing the victim to become a zombie. Upon Harry's arrival in Hong
        Kong, after rejection from his ex-girlfriend, the virus begins to take
        effect. He kills a call girl and is arrested after a gang fight. When he
        is in prison, Harry transforms into a Zombie King and transforms nearly
        an entire Triad gang into his personal horde. Soon, the police
        department becomes a House of the Dead. It's up to a police officer
        named Marco, Harry's ex, and a Triad member named Cheap to stop them
        before it's too late.</image:caption
