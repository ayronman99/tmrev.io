        >"Dorian, a cinematic perfume" is based on Oscar Wilde’s 19th century
        novel "The Picture of Dorian Gray" and its themes of decadence,
        narcissism and the meaning of art. I have interpreted the story and it’s
        queer undertones by casting Dorian as a young woman discovered by a
        fashion photographer, then catapulted into the world of empty celebrity.
        She falls under the tutelage of a famous drag queen and becomes a
        nightclub luminary, constantly followed by the paparazzi. These media
        images become the infamous portrait, grotesquely mutating as she grows
        more beautiful and famous, culminating in her own narcissistic
        destruction.</image:caption
