        >The Mirage saga began fifty years ago. From evolution to technical
        progress, this family of aircraft has established itself as one of the
        most resounding successes of the global aeronautical industry. From the
        Mirage III to the 2000, this program presents most of the aircraft in
        the series. It is made up exclusively of rare images, mostly in color,
        and we must admit that this selection of films from different eras has
        many advantages. Rare or poorly distributed images, we find the first
        flights of the first Mirage at Melun-Villaroche, that of the Mirage IV ,
        the take-offs of the Balzac , the Mirage F1 , the unique prototype
        Mirage 4000 in demonstration and of course the Mirage 2000 in its
        element. But as these planes were born from an industrial logic, the
        Ouragan , Myst√®re IV and other Etendards were not forgotten to finally
        arrive at the Rafale A that we see during its approach tests on the
        Clemenceau.</image:caption
