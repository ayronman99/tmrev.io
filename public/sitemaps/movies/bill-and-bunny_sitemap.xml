        >Bill is on cloud nine. He has just become a big brother to the lovley
        Bolla. At first she seems like any other toddler, curious, jovial and
        sweet. But as the months turn into years and Bolla continues to live in
        a world of her own, it becomes clear that she is not quite like other
        children. Based on the book by Gunilla Bergström, creator and author of
        the Alfons Åberg (Alfie Atkins) books.</image:caption
