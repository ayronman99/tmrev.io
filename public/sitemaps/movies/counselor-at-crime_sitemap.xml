        >When the godson of San Francisco's crime lord asks permission to leave
        "the business," Don Antonio agrees, but reluctantly. Such behavior by
        either one is a violation of the code, and a bloody mob war breaks out.
        It is only through the strong support of his family connections in
        Sicily that Don Antonio is able to survive the mêlée and come out on
        top. Aghast at the situation he has caused, the godson becomes his
        leader's "consigliere," or Counselor at Crime.</image:caption
