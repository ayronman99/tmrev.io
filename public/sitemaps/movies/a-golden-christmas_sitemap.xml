        >After a magical summer together, a nine-year-old boy whispers his heart
        into the ear of a best friend. With a loyal, golden dog by their side,
        the boy and girl bury a time capsule of keepsakes and then go their
        separate ways. Years later, looking for a fresh start, a man and woman
        each return to the place they felt most at home as a child. But a
        comedic case of unknown identity has them competing for the same
        childhood memories and Christmas escapades ensue. For the sake of their
        happiness, they must discover their common past before they turn each
        other's lives completely upside down. Can a golden dog lead them
        home?</image:caption
