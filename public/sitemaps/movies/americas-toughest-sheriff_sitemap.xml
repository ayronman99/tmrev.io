        >His hard-line approach has earned Sheriff Joe Arpaio -- the lead
        law-enforcement officer in Arizona's sprawling Maricopa County -- lots
        of support among voters, as evidenced by his three consecutive landslide
        victories. But not everyone approves of his tactics, which include

        from the elements. This hourlong documentary profiles the flinty lawman
        in a one-on-one interview.</image:caption
