        >Sonia, the daughter of a prominent publisher, is about to fulfill her
        lifelong dream of marrying Rosendo, a promising writer with homosexual
        tendencies, who pines for his fiancee far less than he does for the
        brand new literary award launched by his future father-in-law. The

        film is part of the DOGME 95 Movement, described as follows: 'the goal
        of the Dogme collective is to purify film-making by refusing expensive
        and spectacular special effects, post-production modifications and other
        gimmicks. The emphasis on purity forces the filmmakers to focus on the
        actual story and on the actors' performances. Given these restrictions
        the story and the action of DIAS DE BODA ('WEDDING DAYS') seem much more
        immediate and the lapses in fluidity of the story can be forgiven - to a
        point.</image:caption
