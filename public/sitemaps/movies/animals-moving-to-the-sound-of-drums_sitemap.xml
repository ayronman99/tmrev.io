        >That fall it was not intentional to have a Galway Kinnell book on the
        table near where the caterpillar in the doorway, feeding on our
        offerings, became the butterfly, feeding on honey water, staying in our
        house until we let it go. Or it was not known about the deer in Putney
        or that the baby birds in the raspberry bushes would cry to us in
        summer. A beloved, old friend once visited Vermont to do some work for
        Galway Kinnell and she described a stone table in the field where they
        ate meals in the afternoon - it sounded like a song and so I looked at
        the book and from Little Sleep's-Head Sprouting Hair in the Moonlight
        here is that line: “The still undanced cadence of
        vanishing”.</image:caption
