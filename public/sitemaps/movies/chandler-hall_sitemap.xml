        >The events and images that happen during college go by in the blink of
        an eye. For Jimmy Bravo, those images are about love, sacrifice, and
        ultimately murder, on many different levels. As college freshmen, Jimmy
        and his friends get caught up in the rush of fraternities, sex, and
        drugs, quickly making loads of money as dealers. But soon, Jimmy must
        make sacrifices for his newfound love, and then eventually betray her
        trust and his own integrity to make another sacrifice for his friends.
        This college experience turns out to truly be the experience of life and
        death.</image:caption
