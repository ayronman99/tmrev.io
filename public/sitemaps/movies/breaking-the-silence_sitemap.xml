        >Gong Li stars in this low-key drama about a single mother who will do
        anything to provide for her son. Sun Liying (Li) struggles to care for
        her hearing-impaired child Zheng Da (Gao Xin) after her taxi driver
        husband divorces her. After Zheng Da gets his hearing aid smashed in a
        fight with classmates, Sun Liying sets out to raise 5,000 yuan (a small
        fortune) to buy him a replacement. A friend helps her set up an
        unauthorized bookstall, which soon gets raided by the police. Later she
        splits her time delivering newspapers and cleaning house for a rich
        businessman. This film was screened at the 2000 Berlin Film
        Festival.</image:caption
