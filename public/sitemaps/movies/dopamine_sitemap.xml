        >Rand is a computer animator, who has created an artificial intelligence
        creature designed to interact with children and teach them
        responsibility. When his prototype is forced into practice at a school,
        Rand encounters Sarah, a teacher he was inexplicably drawn to, at his
        favorite bar one fateful evening. Sparks fly between them, but
        fundamental differences in their approaches to love and relationships
        slow them down to a halt.</image:caption
