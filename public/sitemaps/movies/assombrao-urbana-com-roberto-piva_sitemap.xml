        >Urban Haunting with Roberto Piva was part of the 1st DOC-TV: Program
        for Promotion of Production and Broadcasting of the Brazilian
        Documentary, which was called by Imaginary Brazil. The program is a
        documentary about the life and poetry of Roberto Piva, a charismatic and
        contradictory urban figure that portrays in his verses or chaos that he
        observes life in the city of São Paulo. Roberto Piva emerged in the São
        Paulo scene of the 1960s and shows how his life is completely linked to
        the poems he made.</image:caption
