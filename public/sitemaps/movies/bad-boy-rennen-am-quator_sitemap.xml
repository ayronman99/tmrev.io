        >In the Brazilian megacity São Paulo athletes from around the world run
        the traditional New Year's marathon. At the same time in an Amazonian
        jungle backwater 19-year-old Jô is running like a world champion. He has
        skipped town with the generous New Year's collection from the church and
        is being followed by the out-of-breath town sheriff Rui, a fan of the
        marathon. By pure luck he manages to capture Jô. Rui may have missed the
        race on TV, but not talented runner Jô. In the cell sit Jô and a dream.
        He trains Jô for a year until he is at his peak performance. They then
        make the long journey to São Paulo. Sheriff Rui sends his prisoner and
        marathon man Jô into the big race, the legendary New Year's marathon of
        1999, the race into the year 2000. Surprises await.</image:caption
