        >Angela Hewitt shares the inspiration and experience behind her
        award-winning playing in an illustrated lecture that explains the
        technical and practical steps essential for performing Bach on the
        piano. For the first time she appears on a 2-DVD set, launched in
        conjuntion with her Bach World Tour which took her to all corners of the
        globe during the 2007-2008 concert season. In the first disc, she
        conducts a ‘masterclass’, discussing all the challenges, possible
        pitfalls and delights in performing Bach on the piano. The second disc
        features Hewitt live in concert. This is an unmissable
        release.</image:caption
