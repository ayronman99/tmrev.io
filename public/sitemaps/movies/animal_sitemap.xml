        >16-year-old Bella and Vipulan are part of a generation convinced its
        very future is in danger. Between climate change and the 6th mass
        extinction of wildlife, their world could well be inhabitable 50 years
        from now. They have sounded the alarm over and over, but nothing has
        really changed. So they’ve decided to tackle the root of the problem:
        our relationship with the living world. Over the course of an
        extraordinary journey, they come to realize just how deeply humans are
        tied to all other living species. And that by saving them… we’re also
        saving ourselves. Humans thought they could distance themselves from
        nature, but humans are part and parcel of nature. For man is, after all,
        an Animal.</image:caption
