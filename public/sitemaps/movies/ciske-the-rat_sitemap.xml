        >Lovable Amsterdam street urchin, 11 year old Ciske is nevertheless much
        in need of love as the Dutch 1984 title suggests. He is a scamp with a
        heart of gold. He causes havoc in the classroom pouring ink over his
        teacher yet when a polio-crippled boy joins the class Ciske is one of
        the only children to befriend him and is bullied as a result. His mother
        works in a bar and Ciske helps out often late into the night - his
        father is at sea and his mother supplements her income with
        prostitution. Ciske is also a very angry young man and he smoulders with
        rage at life's injustices.</image:caption
