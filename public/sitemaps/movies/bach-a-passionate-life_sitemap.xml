        >John Eliot Gardiner goes in search of Bach the man and the musician.
        The famous portrait of Bach portrays a grumpy 62-year-old man in a wig
        and formal coat, yet his greatest works were composed 20 years earlier
        in an almost unrivalled blaze of creativity. We reveal a complex and
        passionate artist; a warm and convivial family man at the same time a
        rebellious spirit struggling with the hierarchies of state and church
        who wrote timeless music that is today known world-wide. Gardiner
        undertakes a 'Bach Tour' of Germany, and sifts the relatively few clues
        we have - some newly-found. Most of all, he uses the music to reveal the
        real Bach.</image:caption
