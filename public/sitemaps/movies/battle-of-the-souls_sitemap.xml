        >A young reporter loses his girlfriend and job in one day. Then one
        evening while drinking with his longtime buddies at a bar, he comes
        across a cash-filled briefcase belonging to a mysterious underworld
        lord. Greed and conflict over the possession of the money begins to
        erode their friendship. Depressed and in a vulnerable position, Ryan
        agrees to join the underworld lord's organization. Unknown to him, the
        organization is actually a cult that sacrifices humans in exchange for
        wealth and beauty.</image:caption
