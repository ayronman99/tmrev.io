        >Vivian Vadim is a successful fashion stylist in complete charge of her
        life. Then she meets Henry. He's handsome, charming and very, very rich.
        Women throw themselves at him. But he falls for Vivian. Love at first
        sight. She isn't buying. But he won't take no for an answer. He pursues
        her with a passion. But then he has a terrible motorcycle accident and
        almost dies. He is determined to get better but it will take time. Until
        he does, he asks Vivian to take his yacht, the Chromium Blue, and his
        staff and give specially selected women their fantasy adventures. Allow
        them to reach their full potential. And report it all back to him in
        excruciating detail. Until he recovers, he will live through her and
