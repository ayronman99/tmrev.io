        >Pierre Dulaine, an internationally renowned ballroom dancer, is
        starting to fulfill his life long dream - to take his program Dancing
        Classrooms to Jaffa, where he was born. He is teaching 10-year-old
        Israeli-Palestinian and Israeli-Jewish children to dance together.
        Pierre recognizes that the future is built by children. By breaking the
        syndrome of hatred, he will change their lives, and hopefully, the
        community around them.</image:caption
