        >Paul Morse is a good guy. When his friends throw him a wild bachelor
        party, he just wants to keep his conscience clean -- which is why he's
        shocked when he wakes up in bed with a beautiful girl named Becky and
        can't remember the night before. Desperate to keep his fianc√©e, Karen,
        from finding out what may or may not be the truth, he tells her a teensy
        lie. Soon his lies are spiraling out of control and his life is a series
        of comical misunderstandings.</image:caption
