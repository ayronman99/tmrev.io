        >Crocodile in the Yangtze follows China's first Internet entrepreneur
        and former English teacher, Jack Ma, as he battles US giant eBay on the
        way to building China's first global Internet company, Alibaba Group. An
        independent memoir written, directed and produced by an American who
        worked in Ma's company for eight years, Crocodile in the Yangtze
        captures the emotional ups and downs of life in a Chinese Internet
        startup at a time when the Internet brought China face-to-face with the
        West. Crocodile in the Yangtze draws on 200 hours of archival footage
        filmed by over 35 sources between 1995 and 2009. The film presents a
        strikingly candid portrait of Ma and his company, told from the point of
        view of an “American fly on a Chinese wall” who witnessed the successes
        and the mistakes Alibaba encountered as it grew from a small apartment
        into a global company employing 16,000 staff.</image:caption
