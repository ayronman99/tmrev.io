        >On June 6th, 1944 the largest military invasion and defence the world
        has ever seen occurred. D-Day tells the epic story of the preparation
        and execution of the Allied invasion of Normandy. It tells the story of
        the defence of the Western Front by the forces of the German Empire, and
        of the complex and deadly secret war fought by the men and women of
        France and mainland Europe. D-Day brings to life the dramatic and
        astounding tales of courage and sacrifice, joy and despair, love and
        betrayal. The planning for the Allied invasion on June 6th 1944 took two
        years and cost thousands of lives. It involved a deception of
        breathtaking audacity. Both the preparation leading up to and the
        actions and events on the day itself relied on the absolute discretion
        of many and the genius and nerve of a few. D-Day examines the intricate
        jigsaw from both sides - presenting events through the eyes of the men
        and women who were there, telling their extraordinary
        stories.</image:caption
