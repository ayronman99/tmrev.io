        >This film journeys deep into the heart of Austria’s favorite daily
        newspaper, the Kronen Zeitung, the most widely-read paper per capita in
        the world. The “Krone’s” 2.7 million readers represent 43% of the
        Austrian press market. A reflection of the Austrian soul, this newspaper
        serves as a prism through which we can understand the rise of the
        populist Right in this country and examine the dangerous flirtation
        between media and politics. Director and editor-in-chief Hans Dichand’s
        ingenious populist strategy allows him to reach the greatest number of
        readers: the paper’s style and content play on base human instincts such
        as the fear of the “other,” the opposition between “good” and “evil,”
        and the common man’s sense of powerlessness in the political arena. He
        then wields the might of this enormous audience to influence politicians
        and impose his nostalgic vision of a pure, prosperous, and peaceful
        world.</image:caption
