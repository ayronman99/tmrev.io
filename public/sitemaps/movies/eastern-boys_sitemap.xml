        >They come from all over Eastern Europe: Russia, Romania, Chechnya. They
        are Eastern boys. The oldest appear no more than 25; as for the
        youngest, there is no way of telling their age. They hang around the
        Gare du Nord train station in Paris. They might be prostitutes, but
        there is no way of knowing for certain. Muller, a discreet man in his
        late fifties has his eye on one of them - Marek. One afternoon, Muller
        gathers his courage and speaks to him. The young man agrees to come
        visit Muller the following day, at his place. However the next day, when
        the doorbell rings, Muller doesn't have the faintest idea that he has
        fallen into a trap.</image:caption
