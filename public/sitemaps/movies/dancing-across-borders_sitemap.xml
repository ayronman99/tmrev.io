        >On a trip to Angkor Wat in Siem Reap, Cambodia in January 2000,
        filmmaker Anne Bass came across a sixteen-year-old boy who moved her
        immensely with his amazing natural charm and grace as a dancer. A
        longtime devotee of the world of dance, Bass felt compelled to give this
        young boy the opportunity to leave his home and follow a dream that he
        could not yet have fully imagined. From the serene countryside of
        Southeast Asia to the halls of New Yorkâ€™s School of American Ballet to
        the stage of the Pacific Northwest Ballet in Seattle, DANCING ACROSS
        BORDERS peeks behind the scenes into the world of dance and chronicles
        the intimate and triumphant story of a boy who was discovered, and who
        only much later discovered all that he had in himself.</image:caption
