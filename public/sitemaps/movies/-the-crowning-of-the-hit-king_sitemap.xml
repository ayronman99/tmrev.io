        >On the evening of September 11, 1985, before a sellout crowd at
        Riverfront Stadium in Cincinnati, Pete Rose stood on the edge of
        history. With one swing he would collect more hits than anyone in the
        history of the game he loved. 4192: The Crowning of the Hit King is a
        love letter to baseball that highlights the playing career of one of the
        game s most honored and controversial stars. It is a story that began in
        1963 when Rose ran to first base on a walk. It spanned more than two
        decades and brought numerous individual awards as well as three World
        Series titles. But there is more to this story than just awards. It is
        about baseball and what drove this man to chase what many thought was an
        unbreakable record and become The Hit King.</image:caption
