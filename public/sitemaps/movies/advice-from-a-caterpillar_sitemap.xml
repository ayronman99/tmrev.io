        >When it comes to romance, Missy's attitude has always been whatever.
        After all, her artistic career is flourishing...her spacious New York
        City loft is fabulous...and her relationship with a married man is
        totally uncomplicated-what more could a modern girl want? But then Missy
        meets Brat, who's sweet, genuine and shares her fondness for 70's
        sitcoms. Unfortunately, he's also dating her pal Spaz. When Missy and
        Brat unexpectedly fall for each other, will she lose her identity...and
        her best friend? No matter how far you run, true love always finds
        you.</image:caption
