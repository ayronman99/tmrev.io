        >The invasion of a village in Byelorussia by German forces sends young
        Florya into the forest to join the weary Resistance fighters, against
        his family's wishes. There he meets a girl, Glasha, who accompanies him
        back to his village. On returning home, Florya finds his family and
        fellow peasants massacred. His continued survival amidst the brutal
        debris of war becomes increasingly nightmarish, a battle between despair
        and hope.</image:caption
