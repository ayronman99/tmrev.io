        >It is Christmas 1908 in Messina, one of the richest merchant cities of
        the Mediterranean. Peter, the 13 year-old son of a rich English family
        is notorious for his cruelty to children, animals and servants. One
        night he is ambushed and wakes up in a coffin underground in the city's
        Gothic cemetery, buried in retaliation for his callousness by a servant
        boy from his mother's estate. When a powerful earthquake razes Messina
        to the ground, Peter is trapped and his whereabouts are forgotten. Until
        a century later an English archaeologist and his daughter arrive in the
        city.</image:caption
