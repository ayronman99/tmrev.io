        >"Everything will be fine" the doctor promised Jo while she was giving
        birth to her first child. But, some forty years and four sons later,
        nothing is happening like it should be during this month of August: as
        she arrives on Greek soil to organize her traditional festival with her
        tribe, Jo learns that the latter has been cancelled, courtesy of the
        economic crisis. The hour seems to be tragic but the maternal instinct
        grows stronger, she is ready to do everything for the happiness of her
        sons. Between squabbles and blood and destiny blows, this summer will be
        like no other.</image:caption
