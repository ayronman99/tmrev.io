        >What happens to us when we die? It's a question man has asked since the
        beginning of time. Do we live briefly as physical beings then simply
        vanish into oblivion, or do we live on in spirit form? Why are we here,
        and how did we come to be here? Scientists may be closer to answering
        these and other questions than ever before with the largest study ever
        done on near-death and out-of-body experiences - the results of which
        have huge implications on how we view death. The results suggest that
        our consciousness does not get annihilated when we die. More than 8
        million Americans have reported Near Death Experiences that include
        floating outside of their bodies, moving rapidly through a tunnel toward
        a light or seeing deceased loved ones. Perhaps death is not an end, but
        a beginning as we enter new worlds of existence we can only
        imagine.</image:caption
