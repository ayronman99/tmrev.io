        >In late 19th Century, Bengal Bhubaneswar Chowdhury (Jackie Shroff) is a
        wealthy and tyrannical Zamidar (Squire). He has two main obsessions: his
        desperate attempts for an heir, which even his new second wife Jashomati
        seems unable to deliver; and competing with his regional rivals to
        produce the most magnificent effigy of a goddess for the annual Durga
        Puja ceremony. This year he concocts a master plan - why not change the
        face of the goddess for the most powerful woman on Earth - Queen
        Victoria. Meantime his two wives Mahomaya and Jashomati try to look out
        for one another especially as Bhubeneshwar begins to sexually assault
        his younger wife each night. Traumatised and lonely, Jashomati is
        dangerously drawn towards the youthful sculptor who has been employed to
        create the great effigy of Durga, Goddess of destruction.</image:caption
