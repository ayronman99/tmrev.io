        >Pop superstar Adelaide Kay is so fed up with her controlling manager
        that she sneaks off the tour bus after their latest squabble. Though
        exhilarated to be free, she finds herself stranded in the freezing cold
        of a Pennsylvania winter, with no money and no plan. A local family, the
        Lapps, take her in. They know the true meaning of the season, even if
        they’re close to losing their dairy farm. No one in the family
        recognizes Adelaide except Dillon, the oldest son. He figures she’s the
        ticket to fast cash and plots to snap photos of Adelaide around the farm
        and sell them to the tabs. What he doesn’t plan, however, is their
        mutual attraction.</image:caption
