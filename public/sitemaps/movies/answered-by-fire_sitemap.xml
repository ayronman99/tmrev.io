        >Mark Waldman (David Wenham) is an Australian policeman who volunteers
        for the United Nations mission in East Timor. Put in charge of the
        Civilian Police at the UN base in Nunura, he meets Julie Fortin
        (Isabelle Blais), a Canadian policewoman on her first overseas mission,
        and Ismenio Soares (Alex Tilman), the young Timorese translator assigned
        to work with the unit. Mark and Julie are unarmed and emotionally
        unprepared for the brutal reality of Timor, while Ismenio is cynical
        about whether the UN can prevent what seems an inevitable, bloody end to
        the process. Against growing intimidation and violence from the
        Indonesians and East Timorese militia, they work to get the Timorese
        registered to vote. Ismenio's fears are realised when the vote goes
        pro-independence, the country is set alight and the UN evacuates. Mark
        and Julie are forced to abandon Ismenio and his family to a nightmarish
        fate at the hands of the Indonesian military and its murderous
        militias.</image:caption
