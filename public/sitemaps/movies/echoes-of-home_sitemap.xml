        >What does a baby's cry have in common with the echo of a mountain
        yodler, and what connects the head tone of a Tuvin nomad with the stage
        show of a vocal artist? The answer is: THE VOICE. Against a background
        of powerful alpine vistas and modern city landscapes, "heimatkl√§nge"
        enters the wondrous sonic world of three exceptional Swiss vocal
        artists. Their universe of sound extends far beyond what we would
        describe as singing. In their engagement with local and foreign
        traditions, the powerful mountain landscape becomes a stage as do the
        landscapes and sonic backdrops of modern life.</image:caption
