        >This unprecedented and exclusive insider's account by filmmaker James
        Hanlon and Gedeon and Jules Naudet of the World TradeCenter attack,
        which contains the only known footage of the first plane striking the
        World Trade Center and the only footage from inside Ground Zero during
        the attacks, will also include footage from events marking the 10th
        anniversary, as well as new interviews with many of the firefighters who
        were featured in the original program. They will discuss how their
        lives, families and the world have changed in the 10 years since the
        tragedy - some for better, some for worse. Viewers will also hear from
        New York City Fire Department health officials as they discuss some of
        the health issues that have plagued firefighters working at Ground
        Zero.</image:caption
