        >This harrowing war film is an epic dramatization of the first battle of
        World War II. The Battle of Westerplatte that began on 1 September 1939
        will forever be remembered as the one that announced the beginning of
        the Second World War in Europe. Over one week, fewer than 200 Polish
        soldiers fought against heavy German bombardment and in the process came
        to symbolize the power of resistance. As the violence rages, a complex
        battle of a more personal nature plays out between two Polish commanders
        over how to best lead their men. Amid the bloodshed, they must ask
        themselves â€“ should they fight until the last man standing or surrender
        in the face of overwhelming odds? What unfolds is a stirring exploration
        of the fight against the forces of tyranny.</image:caption
