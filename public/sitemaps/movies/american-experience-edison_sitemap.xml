        >By the time he died in 1931, Thomas Alva Edison was one of the most
        famous men in the world. The holder of more patents than any other
        inventor in history, Edison had achieved glory as the genius behind such
        revolutionary inventions as sound recording, motion pictures, and
        electric light. Born on the threshold of America's burgeoning industrial
        empire, Edison's curiosity led him to its cutting edge. With just three
        months of formal schooling, he took on one seemingly impossible
        technical challenge after another, and through intuition, persistence,
        and a unique team approach to innovation, invariably solved it. Driven
        and intensely competitive, Edison was often neglectful in his private
        life and could be ruthless in business. Challenged by competition in the
        industry he'd founded, Edison launched an ugly propaganda campaign
        against his rivals, and used his credibility as an electrical expert to
        help ensure that high-voltage electrocution became a form of capital
        punishment.</image:caption
