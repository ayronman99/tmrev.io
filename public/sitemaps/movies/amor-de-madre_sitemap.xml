        >The love that a mother feels justifies everything, a mother is capable
        of murder because of her child, she kills, she steals, she works the
        corner or any other thing that keeps her child alive; the love that a
        mother feels, brings up the better and the worst in every woman. Ursula
        (Ana Polvorosa) is a mother and she is living two tragedies at the same
        time, a zombie invasion and the fact that her husband left home with
        their son, Nicolas. To Ursula, the zombie invasion is just “an anecdote”
        because she, as a mother and as a woman, only cares about her missing
        child, helpless and alone in a world surrounded by green and crazy
        beings.</image:caption
