        >After her car breaks down on a rainy night, Miss Liang enters a nearby
        coffee shop called Cafe 6. The owner of the shop finds out that Miss
        Liang has just gotten into a fight with her boyfriend who is currently
        overseas, so to kill time, he shares a story of his time back in 1996.
        During that year, Guan Min-lu and his good friend Xiao Bo-zhi always
        hang out together. Min-lu is secretly in love with Li Xin-rui while
        Bo-zhi is attracted to Xin-rui's best friend, Cai Xin-yi. The four young
        teenagers share a good relationship with each other and spend their days
        happily every day. But as their graduation day draws near, they wonder
        if they can still stay committed with each other after going their
        separate ways.</image:caption
