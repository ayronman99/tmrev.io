        >Recently single and starting a new job in a different city, Erin, a
        canine therapist, is getting a fresh start. But just when she thought
        her new life would be the reset she needed, her self-centered boss,
        Martin, tasks Erin with finding homes for 12 puppies who were left
        behind after a photo shoot for his struggling GPS locator company - and
        all before Christmas. As they work together, Erin realizes Martin may
        not be so bad after all, and her take-charge attitude not only helps
        Martin save his company, but also reveals a calmer, better self that
        opens them both up to the idea of love.</image:caption
