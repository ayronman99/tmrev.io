        >Australia's most popular comedian is back with his fourth show, A One
        Ended Stick, and it's his best yet!! Filmed in front of a packed house
        at the beautiful Lyric Theatre in Brisbane. Come on a journey with Carl
        in this intimate 90 minute performance as he explores his favourite
        subject: everyday life. Half man, half child this is Carl doing what he
        does best - talking about the things we all relate to and making them
        very, very funny.</image:caption
