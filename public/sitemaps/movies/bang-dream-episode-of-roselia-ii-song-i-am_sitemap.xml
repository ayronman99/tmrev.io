        >After overcoming numerous tribulations, the members of Roselia promised
        to appear on FUTURE WORLD FES. It is now Autumn... Through writing the
        lyrics of "Promise," Lisa has matured. Watching the change of color in
        the autumn leaves, Yukina and Sayo expressed their resolve in a picture
        letter to their future selves. Driven by the wish to do something for
        Roselia, Rinko has started to compose a new song. "The remaining quests
        are the contest, the tournament, and FUTURE WORLD FES..." Reflecting on
        their goals, Ako starts to feel anxious. What view will the five of them
        see beyond FUTURE WORLD FES?</image:caption
