        >Recap of the Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio: Ars Nova TV series, with
        approximately 40 minutes of new material. By 2039, global warming had
        caused sea levels to rise and large amount of territory to be lost. As
        though in response, a mysterious group of warships clad in mist, "the
        Fleet of Mist," appeared in every corner of the ocean, and began
        attacking human ships. In spite of humanity mustering all their
        strength, they were utterly defeated by the Mist's overwhelming force.
        All of humanity's trade routes were blockaded by the Fleet of Mist,
        their political economy was destroyed, and the human race was steadily
        beaten down. Seven years later, the Fleet of Mist's submarine I-401
        appears before cadet Gunzo Chihaya. The humanoid life form that pilots
        the sub, who should be their enemy, is instead offering her services to
        mankind.</image:caption
