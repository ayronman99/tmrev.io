        >Raw, wild and hilariously funny, Bert Kreischer stars in "Comfortably
        Dumb," his debut comedy concert that follows his scene stealing
        appearances on Comedy Central and FX. He is one of today's hottest, most
        inventive comedians, something that a few years ago would have been
        deemed virtually impossible. Especially to Bert. It wasn't long ago when
        Rolling Stone Magazine named him "the number one party animal in the
        nation!" when this dedicated underachiever made a career out of
        attending Florida State University, a seven year adventure that became
        the basis for National Lampoon's hit movie, "Van Wilder." Now Bert has
        finally grown up. Sort of. And the result is a sold-out event destined
        to become a classic. This is your chance to party with the original
        party animal.</image:caption
