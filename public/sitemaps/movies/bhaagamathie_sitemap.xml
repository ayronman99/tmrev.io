        >Accused of murdering her husband, IAS officer Chanchala, is taken to a
        haunted house called Bhaaghamathie Bungalow, where police and CBI
        officials interrogate her to dig up dirt on a politician she had worked
        under. As she's left alone in the haunted house, spirits take control of
        her and IAS Chanchala transforms into an unrecognisable person. How this
        impacts her and everyone around her forms the crux of the
        story.</image:caption
