        >Against the backdrop of New York and New Orleans, Elliott, Leanne and
        Jermaine question their ability to dream amidst a crumbling economic
        climate. Opening in the streets of downtown Manhattan, Elliott (23),
        living at home after college, is surrounded by incomplete projects,
        frustrated and in search of purpose. Simultaneously, in New Orleans,
        Leanne (26), an aspiring model/actress and single mother of four,
        struggles to pick up the pieces, presenting at times a clash between
        family and her ambitious career. Plagued by an unforgiving criminal
        record, Jermaine (22), a New Orleans native, shifts through his home
        town for what seems like a hopeless attempt at legal employment. After a
        series of rejections, he resolves to reinvent himself in hopes of
        successfully starting anew.</image:caption
