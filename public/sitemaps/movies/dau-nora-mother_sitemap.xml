        >Once just a girl from the provinces, Nora is now married to a
        successful scientist and lives together with her family within the
        confines of a secret and privileged Moscow institute. Nora is visited by
        her mother for the first time since her wedding. Her mother closely
        observes the atmosphere within the couple's home, trying to work out
        whether her daughter is happy. During the course of their intimate
        conversations the complexity of their contradictory relationship is
        revealed.</image:caption
