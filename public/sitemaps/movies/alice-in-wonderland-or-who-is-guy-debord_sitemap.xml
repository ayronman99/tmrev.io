        >Alice in Wonderland, or Who Is Guy Debord? was created as part of the
        Electrodist project, a collective endeavor which has the aim of
        introducing critical elements into the mainstream marketplace through
        the alteration of consumer media products. Utilizing DVD decryption
        freeware and common DVD authoring programs, the video is placed as a
        special feature within the existing and publicly accessible Disney Alice
        […] DVDs, and then redistributed by Electrodist into various video
        rental systems for consumer access. All original material and menu
        access structures are kept intact in the modified discs, so the addition
        of Alice in Wonderland or Who is Guy Debord? has a parasitic
        relationship to the DVD product. […] The video, within this context, is
        an attempt to provoke adult consumers, within the safe space of their
        own living rooms, into thinking critically about the object of their
        consumption, its creators, and its viewing context.</image:caption
