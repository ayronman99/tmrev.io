        >Andarivaadu (Telugu: అందరివాడు) is a 2005 Tollywood comedy film
        directed by Srinu Vytla. The film stars Chiranjeevi, Rimi Sen, Tabu and
        Prakash Raj. This movie was a hit. Govinda Rajulu (Chiranjeevi) is a
        'mesthri' who drinks a lot and lives a care-free life. His son Siddartha
        (Chiranjeevi), on the other hand, is a popular TV show host and is a
        more disciplined man — the opposite of his dad. The son gets his father
        married to Shanti (Tabu) to sober him.</image:caption
