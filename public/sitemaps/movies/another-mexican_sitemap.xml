        >Antonio (Ricky Mergold) is a 16 year old boy from a village in the
        Mexican province, living the awakening of consciousness with the
        intensity of the contradictions that surround him: a dogmatic religion,
        mediocre educational institutions, corrupt politicians an a society full
        of conformity. His life changes when a young teacher with a genuine
        desire to teach their students comes to the town, a guide that
        encourages them to live with dignity and to be critical of the world
        around them. This story is full of drama and misadventures, which
        Antonio lives without proper orientation and promiscuity.</image:caption
