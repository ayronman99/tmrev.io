        >A year on an Alpine farm: an older couple have two children, Belli, who
        wanted to be a teacher, and the younger Franzi, deaf, and although he
        works like a man, child-like. Belli teaches him. In his work, he can
        become frustrated, so when he throws an expensive mower over a cliff in
        a fit of pique, his father banishes him to the outskirts of the farm,
        where he uses pubescent energy to break rocks and build walls and
        cairns. (It's the tradition of the father's family, called "The
        Irascibles" by neighbors, to spend puberty doing this.) Belli visits him
        and they begin sleeping together. By winter, the boy is back in the
        house and Belli is pregnant. Soon her parents must know.</image:caption
