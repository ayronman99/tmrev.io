        >In 2019, Nepalese mountain climber Nirmal “Nims” Purja set out to do
        the unthinkable by climbing the world’s fourteen highest summits in less
        than seven months. (The previous record was eight years). He called the
        effort “Project Possible 14/7” and saw it as a way to inspire others to
        strive for greater heights in any pursuit. The film follows his team as
        they seek to defy naysayers and push the limits of human
        endurance.</image:caption
