        >Northern Germany, winter. It is Tobias' birthday and he is very
        disappointed by his mother's present: a wool cap. In the meantime, the
        skinhead Haske decides to leave his group but drives his car into the
        river. At a bus stop he meets Tobias, who gives him his cap. A car
        stops. It is Kyalja, who is going to the bank to withdraw some money she
        needs to pay for her husband's cancer therapy. Haske gives her the
        cap.</image:caption
