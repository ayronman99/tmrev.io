        >Many artists use the pain, exhilaration and resolution of private
        desires to express themselves. Art City: A Ruling Passion focuses on
        intense personalities who’ve used their art to explore the emotional
        impact of psychological truths. Everything that Louise Bourgeois creates
        - whether in marble, fabric or bronze - comes from memory. Michael Ray
        Charles investigates the marketing of black memorabilia, using early
        American advertising imagery. Elizabeth Peyton reinvents portraiture,
        using her friends as subjects, as well as pop culture royalty. Ed
        Ruscha’s literary landscapes burst from the physical world "right
        outside the window." The comic spirit of Lari Pittman contrasts with his
        graphic declarations. In a landmark house, Richmond Burton remembers his
        dreams to build "psychic fields" of abstraction. The arrays of
        featureless faces by David Deutsch are stimulated by sub-conscious
        sensations.</image:caption
