        >Merchants of Cool, a live album selected from gigs in Denver and
        Anaheim in 2002, sees them at their strongest in years. With Rodgers and
        drummer Simon Kirke from the original outfit and guitarist David
        "Bucket" Colwell, now a member of more than 10 years' standing, they're
        supremely tight, running through a succession of hits like "Can't Get
        Enough," "Feel Like Makin' Love," "Burnin' Sky," "Rock and Roll
        Fantasy," and Free's immortal "All Right Now." Mostly, the songs are
        well-honed and urgent, free from indulgent solos, but Rodgers--whose
        voice has always been Bad Company's main attraction--leaves too many
        choruses to the crowd.</image:caption
