        >Sohail is an ambitious law undergraduate who signs up with MI5 and,
        eager to play a part in protecting British security, begins an
        investigation into a terrorist cell. His sister Nasima is a medical
        student in Leeds who becomes increasingly alienated and angered by
        Britain's foreign and domestic policy after witnessing at first hand the
        relentless targeting of her Muslim neighbours and peers. With action set
        in Pakistan, Eastern Europe, London and Leeds, both feature-length
        episodes detail a tragic sequence of events from two distinct
        perspectives. At the heart of this thought-provoking drama is a
        revealing examination of British Muslim life under current anti-terror
        legislation. Britz ultimately asks whether the laws we think are making
        us safer, are actually putting us in greater danger.</image:caption
