        >During a Japanese robotic exploration to find life on the other side of
        the moon, Nobita is watching from Earth and sees the moon turn yellow.
        With the help of Doraemon, the pair travel to the moon and create
        bunnies that will build their own colony. After he returns, Nobita tells
        his class about their adventure but no one will believe him. That is
        until a new student and his sister arrive who appear to come from a very
        far away place...</image:caption
