        >Lino Settembre and his wife Chicca lead a tranquil married life without
        any serious problems. They are satisfied with their careers. He's the
        sports editor at the Messenger and she's a professor of medieval
        languages at the Universita' Gregoriana. The only true disappointment in
        their 25 years of marriage has been the lack of children. They used the
        situation to strengthen their marriage instead of letting it become real
        problem. But now, in a totally unexpected way, they're presented with a
        big worry: Lino is having some really serious memory problems that
        little by little get worse and start to interrupt the routine of their
        daily lives and activities both at home and at work. At first both Lino
        and Chicca decide to laugh it off but the problem manifests itself more
        and more until, after careful attention and in-depth medical exams, they
        receive the diagnosis of degenerative brain disease that's destroying
        his brain.</image:caption
