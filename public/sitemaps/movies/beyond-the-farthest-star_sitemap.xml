        >A twist of fate brings the national spotlight to a forgotten Texas town
        and a once famous preacher has an opportunity to regain his former glory
        or seize one last chance to restore his fractured family. Narrated by
        his fifteen-year-old daughter, Beyond the Farthest Star tells the story
        of Pastor Adam Wells, a minister driven by the prospect of achieving
        greatness as the next nationally syndicated TV Evangelist who must
        decide whether to give up his opportunity at “celebrity” and, even his
        own life, in order to become something even greater… A loving husband
        and father to his wife and daughter.</image:caption
