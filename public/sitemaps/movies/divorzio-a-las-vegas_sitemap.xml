        >Lorenzo known as Ghandi and Elena met at 18 during a vacation through
        Nevada and ended up doing the classic madness: they got married in Las
        Vegas. A few hours later everyone was going their own way, putting the
        incident behind them (or at least that's what Elena thinks). Twenty
        years later Elena is about to marry a very rich and brilliant man, but
        her best friend Sara, a lawyer, informs her that, being technically
        still married to Lorenzo, she must first dissolve that bond or she will
        be accused of bigamy. Elena and Lorenzo must therefore return to Las
        Vegas and obtain a divorce decree in a few days. If they really want
        to.</image:caption
