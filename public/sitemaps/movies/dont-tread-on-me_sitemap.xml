        >From the Tea Party Movement to State Legislators, the American people
        are drawing a line in the sand. On what side of it will you stand? Has
        the government our Founders created been forgotten by Washington DC? Is
        a Patriot Uprising ready to capture the spirit of 1776? "Don't Tread On
        Me: Rise of the Republic" gives the viewer a look into the movements,
        mindset, and legislation that will catapult the "Great Restoration" into
        households across America. What is the choke-collar the Federal
        Government uses to reign in the States? Are the States sovereign or
        subjects of Washington DC? What did the Founders foresee and how did
        they seek to protect us from a tyrannical government?</image:caption
