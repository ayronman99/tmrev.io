        >Bulan is a street hawker whose parents were killed during the Bali
        Bombing in 2002. A talented sculptor, she secretly carves a statue
        inside a cave that she names the Angel's Cry. She gives the statue as a
        gift to her friend, Kevin, a mixed Balinese Caucasian, who wants to help
        by displaying the sculpture at his father’s gallery. An Australian
        tourist buys the statue and more so Bulan’s secret talent is revealed.
        The success brings a dramatic turn to her life and Kevin’s parents also
        adopt her.</image:caption
