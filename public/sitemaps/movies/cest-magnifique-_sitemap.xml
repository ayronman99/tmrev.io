        >When Pierre learns that his parents are not his parents, he wants to
        find out who he is and where he comes from. Raised in nature, Pierre has
        never been confronted with society. He does not know the codes. He will
        team up with Anna who will help him in his quest and cross a whole
        gallery of characters as funny as tender. But during his investigation,
        Pierre will lose his colors â€“ like a photo that fades.</image:caption
