        >In November 1940, German bombers destroyed much of the city centre of
        Coventry and reduced the city's medieval cathedral to rubble. Just 22
        years later, in May 1962, a new cathedral designed by Basil Spence was
        consecrated on the site. Built in a bold modern style, incorporating the
        ruins of the old cathedral and adorned with a wealth of modern artworks,
        Coventry Cathedral is recognised today as one of Britain's greatest
        postwar buildings. Using a wealth of rarely seen archive film, together
        with voices from yesterday and today, the film tells the story of the
        new cathedral and of the times in which it was created.</image:caption
