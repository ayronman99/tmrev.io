        >Nop is a small time thief who gets a job from the local Chinese mafia
        in Bangkok. He and another guy have to pick up some girls from a small
        fishing port nearby who have been smuggled in from China to work in a
        Karaoke bar and deliver them to Bangkok. On the way back into town they
        are stopped at a police check point and the cops soon realize the people
        in the van are all illegal immigrants. He runs away with a girl who
        speaks some Thai named Liew who is coming to Thailand to pay back her
        family's debts. A chase leads to them nearly being captured and Nop is
        shot but they manage to escape and hide out in Pattaya for a few days.
        They have a relationship but Nop must hand over the girl to the mob no
        matter what. She does not want to work in the bar but is forced to. Nop
        does not agree...</image:caption
