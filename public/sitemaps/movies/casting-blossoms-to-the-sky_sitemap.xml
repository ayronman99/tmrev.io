        >In 2011, a journalist arrives in Nagaoka, a Japanese village that
        underwent destruction during both World War II and the 2004 ChÅ«etsu
        earthquakes, and is now notable for the fireworks it launches annually
        in memory of the victims of war. She is there for two reasons: firstly,
        to learn about the experiences of Nagaoka's inhabitants, and secondly,
        to watch a stage play written by an enigmatic student of her
        ex-boyfriend, which depicts the bombing of the city during
        WWII.</image:caption
