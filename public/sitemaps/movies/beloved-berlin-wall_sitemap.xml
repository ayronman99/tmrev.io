        >Berlin, 1989. Sascha is a young East German border guard and Franzi is
        a lively young West German woman who's just moved into a flat next to
        Sascha's watchtower at the Berlin Wall. It takes only a slight mishap
        and a selfless act of chivalry and the two fall in love. But soon the
        Stasi believes they are witnessing the start of a revolt. This is the
        time of mass protests and East Germans taking refuge in the West German
        embassy in Prague after all. Franzi and Sascha have to find their ways
        to stand up for their love and strive for the impossible; to bring down
        the wall.</image:caption
