        Kollek focuses on an alcoholic, who tries to regain custody of her son.
        Being addicted to alcohol, single mother Anna had to give her son to
        foster parents, but they would "sell" him back if she offers enough
        money. When she gets to know Pete, the mentally handicapped son of a
        wealthy author, his father asks her to marry his son for one million
        dollar.</image:caption
