        >The many references in contemporary film to Edward Hopper's works, as
        well as the widespread reproduction of some of his paintings have made
        his universe familiar to many. His unclassifiable figurations weave a
        dialogue between appearances and light, between the unmistakeable and
        enigma. Focusing on the artist's personal life in the context of 20th
        century America, "Edward Hopper and the Blank Canvas" bears witness to a
        fiercely independent painter, who was aware of the issues of his era,
        and who was hostile to the imprisonment that a modern American art
        opposing realism and abstraction could lead him to. This film brings the
        artist to life, transposing his realist and metaphysical poetry. It is a
        subtile and passionate work, which at last unveils one of the most
        important painters of American modernity.</image:caption
