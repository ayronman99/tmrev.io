        >A major work of the celebrated Berlin School, the debut of Ulrich
        Köhler (In My Room) is a mesmerizing portrait of a young German soldier
        named Paul who goes AWOL and returns to his childhood home in the
        countryside. Over a few summer days, Paul evades the responsibilities of
        everyday life and falls in love with his brother’s girlfriend,
        disrupting the lives of everyone in his circle. With Köhler’s penchant
        for deadpan humor and subtle performances, Bungalow becomes a quiet
        mockery of militarism, familial estrangement, and youthful
        ennui.</image:caption
