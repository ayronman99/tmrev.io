        >The Vrijthof concerts have been going for ten years and this
        anniversary was all the excuse André Rieu needed to make things extra
        festive and put on a fantastic, unforgettable anniversary concert with
        his new DVD, ‘Love In Venice’ – a selection of favourites from the
        concert. For this tenth concert series he had the Vrijthof square
        specially decorated in Venetian style, complete with a Doge’s Palace,
        Rialto Bridge, a fabulous Italian fountain and a colourful Venetian
        masquerade and it was a party from start to end. Love In Venice is an
        evening full of wonderful Italian music, world hits like Funiculi
        funicula, Tiritomba and Vieni sul mar and fabulous operatic arias. For
        the occasion of this anniversary, the Italian singer Rocco Granata came
        to sing his world hit Marina. Thanks to the perfect sound and image
        recordings on this DVD you can enjoy it at home just as though you were
        there yourself.</image:caption
