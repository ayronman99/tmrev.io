        >Every high school has its misfits, its square pegs, its rebels. St.
        Michael's Academy, nestled on an impossibly pretty and strangely remote
        Japanese island, is no exception. In fact, given the atmosphere of
        strictness, propriety and even subtle menace looming over the elite,
        aristocratic, Catholic boarding school, it's no wonder Fumio, Kazune and
        Yuzuko quickly bond over their dislike of the place. With rumors of rich
        girls being kidnapped in the region, and even more so, their legal
        guardians, including the school's enigmatic headmaster, Mr. Lawrence,
        and Fumio's brother are suspicious and on alert. Then an accidental and
        inexplicable unleashing of magic power infuses the girls with
        spectacular abilities. When the truth about the kidnappings is revealed,
        they're going to need them.</image:caption
