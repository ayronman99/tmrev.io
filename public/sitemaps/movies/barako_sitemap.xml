        >100 years after the defeat of the local troops under Gen. Miguel Malvar
        in the Philippine-American War, the people of a Batangue√±o town would
        have lost its character typified by the Tagalog term "barako", meaning
        brave or courageous. Much worse, they have become subservient to their
        corrupt leaders who have been taking advantage of their ignorance and
        poverty. But they are slowly swayed to a new liberal direction by a
        small coffee club called "barakuhan" whose organizers see in it a
        reawakening of their native courage.</image:caption
