        >Ryan and Jennifer are opposites who definitely do not attract. At least
        that's what they always believed. When they met as twelve-year-olds,
        they disliked one another. When they met again as teenagers, they
        loathed each other. But when they meet in college, the uptight Ryan and
        the free-spirited Jennifer find that their differences bind them
        together and a rare friendship develops.</image:caption
