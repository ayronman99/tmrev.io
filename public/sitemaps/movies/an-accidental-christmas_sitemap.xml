        >Separated after 15 years of marriage, Vicki and Jason are set up by
        their two teenage children to spend a Christmas vacation together on the
        beach. But their family vacation is further complicated when Vicki's
        boss and Jason's gorgeous assistant show up. As Jason spends more time
        with Vicki, it becomes clear that this marriage is far from over, and he
        decides to propose to her all over again. It will take a lot of luck,
        plenty of love and a little dose of magic to bring this family back
        together again.</image:caption
