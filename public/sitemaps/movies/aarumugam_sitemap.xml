        >Aarumugam is owner of a small food joint. He is closely attached to his
        mother. He is quiet and his simple life gets shattered by one of
        Bharath's business rivals (Ramya Krishnan) who runs a big restaurant
        near his place. The petty clashes soon develop into bigger problems. How
        Aarumugam solves them is told in an action-cum sentiment filled
        screenplay.</image:caption
