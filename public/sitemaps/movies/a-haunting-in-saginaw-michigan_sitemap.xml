        >When a single mother and her two young daughters moved into their new
        home - adjacent to a cemetery - they had no idea they were making the
        biggest mistake of their lives. The family's "dream house" ultimately
        became their worst nightmare when they realized it was inhabited by an
        aggressive & territorial spirit. Desperate to drive them out, the entity
        repeatedly taunts the mother by terrorizing her young children and
        anyone who dares visit the residence.</image:caption
