        >Mother's good boy Benny Silman from Brooklyn becomes an economics
        student at Arizona State University for the sun and sexy girls- and the
        proximity of gambling paradise Las Vegas. Benny aces his studies, being
        a mathematical genius, but the one who earns money from him at sports is
        bookie Troy, who however recruits him as subcontractor, making a few

        dozen student vassals, and makes a hundredfold.</image:caption
