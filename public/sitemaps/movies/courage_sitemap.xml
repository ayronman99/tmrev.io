        >Alfred and Jerzy take part in a brutal incident: during a train ride, a
        couple of hooligans harass a young woman. Jerzy stands in her defense.
        Alfred hesitates and becomes a helpless bystander as his younger brother
        is thrown off the moving train. 'Courage' is about people whose lives
        get disturbed by a violent act, which forces them to reveal who they
        really are.</image:caption
