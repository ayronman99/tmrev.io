        >Enjoy a special stream of Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS’ benefit
        concert celebrating Disney on Broadway’s 25th anniversary. The online
        playback will raise money for Broadway Cares’ COVID-19 Emergency
        Assistance Fund, which is helping everyone in the theater and performing
        arts community impacted by the pandemic and work shutdown. Ryan McCartan
        (Frozen) hosted the stream live from his family’s home and will
        interview special Disney on Broadway stars, from their homes, throughout
        the evening. The show also included a much-anticipated, high-energy
        reunion of 18 Newsies from the show’s Broadway and national touring
        productions, and a moving performance from Broadway Inspirational
        Voices. The November concert was directed by Casey Hushion. James Abbott
        was the music director and created the revised orchestrations. Howard
        Joines was the orchestra coordinator. The creative team included
        lighting designer Ryan J. O’Gara and sound designers Kurt Fischer and
        Marie Renee Foucher.</image:caption
