        >Black holes stand at the limit of what we can know. To explore that
        edge of knowledge, the Event Horizon Telescope links observatories
        across the world to simulate an earth-sized instrument. With this tool
        the team pursues the first-ever picture of a black hole, resulting in an
        image seen by billions of people in April 2019. Meanwhile, Hawking and
        his team attack the black hole paradox at the heart of theoretical
        physics—Do predictive laws still function, even in these massive
        distortions of space and time? Weaving them together is a third strand,
        philosophical and exploratory using expressive animation. “Edge” is
        about practicing science at the highest level, a film where observation,
        theory, and philosophy combine to grasp these most mysterious
        objects.</image:caption
