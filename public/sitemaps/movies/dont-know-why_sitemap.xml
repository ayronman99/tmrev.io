        >Dunno Y...Na Jaane Kyon (English: Don't Know Why) is a 2010 Indian
        film. The film was directed by Sanjay Sharma and written by his brother
        Kapil Sharma who also played the lead. It premiered in April 2010 at
        India's first mainstream gay film festival, the Kashish Mumbai
        International Queer Film Festival. It features the first gay kiss in
        Indian cinema between Yuvraaj Parashar and Kapil Sharma. Two young men
        fall in love with each other but struggle to come to terms on how best
        to comfortably and securely express it in public. Between family
        pressures and social taboo on the matter, the fictional gay couple
        remains closeted lovers and patiently await the day a love as special as
        theirs may be understood and shared with the world without fear of any
        backlash.</image:caption
