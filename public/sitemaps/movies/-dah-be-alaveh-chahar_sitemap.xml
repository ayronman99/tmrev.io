        >Mania Akbari’s second feature 10+4 reproduces the situation and, at
        least initially, the form – a blurring of the line between documentary
        and fiction – of Abbas Kiarostami’s 2002 feature Ten, in which Akbari
        played the protagonist. It opens on the same set-up as Ten, in which
        Akbari and her then ten-year-old son Amin Maher bicker in the car. Cut
        to the present; both mother and son are in the same position in the car
        continuing their argument, but with a twist – Akbari is now directing
        herself as lead, and engaged in a fight against breast cancer that will
        end with her having a double mastectomy. She is thirty years
        old.</image:caption
