        >Clay Kincaid hates the nickname 'Saint', he got for being too kind to
        stray animals and desperate people. Especially when it comes to women.
        With a rough and damaged past that has left him jaded, he doesn't do
        committed relationships. This is before he meets Samantha Jamieson, an
        heiress turned runaway in need of help. When she starts to work as a
        waitress at his bar, he discovers that she is someone truly special and
        amazingâ€¦ someone that could warm his damaged heart.</image:caption
