        >Political comedy about the Government (domestic and foreign policies),
        the president, the public's own ignorance and faults, and so forth. He
        also makes some hilarious detours in his own renditions of rap lyrics
        read out in proper, coherent (non-Ebonic) language. There are also some
        very poignant pieces on Bush, religion, drugs (notably marijuana), which
        then link to homeland security. Unlike a comedian like George Carlin who
        may go from topics in the 'big world' in his act to things in the
        'little world' like spotting the random things in life, Maher is very
        much a comedian of the times, on the attack but clear about his
        political allegiances.</image:caption
