        >At the Edge of the World chronicles the controversial Sea Shepherd
        Antarctic Campaign against a Japanese whaling fleet. The international
        volunteer crew, under-trained and under-equipped, develop a combination
        of bizarre and brilliant tactics with which to stop the whalers. But
        first they must find the Japanese ships, a far more difficult challenge
        than ever imagined - long-time activist Paul Watson and first-time
        captain Alex Cornelissen employ an array of strategies in the hopes of
        finding an elusive adversary in the vast expanse of the Ross Sea. With
        one ship (the Farley Mowat) too slow to chase down the whaling fleet,
        with their second ship (the Robert Hunter) unsuited for Antarctic ice
        conditions and with no country supporting their efforts to enforce
        international law, the situation becomes increasingly desperate. Against
        all odds, however, a real-life pirate tale unfolds - a modern-day "David
        vs. Goliath" adventure.</image:caption
