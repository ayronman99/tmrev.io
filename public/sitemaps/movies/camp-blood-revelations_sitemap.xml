        >The Killing at Camp Blood stopped for a while. But the son of the
        original killer clown has carried on the machete and driven by his
        deranged mother, played by Sally Mullins (Things 4, Lights Out With
        David Spade), continues to kill anyone who trespasses in his woods. When
        a group of female volleyball players' vehicle breaks down in the woods,
        they are all potential victims of the killer clown. Their leader and
        coach Dolly, played by Phoebe Dollar (Hell's Highway, Sunset Society),
        devices a plan that is meant to help them escape, but could possible get
        them all killed. Is she in on the murders" Does she have a dark secret
        herself? All will be revealed.</image:caption
