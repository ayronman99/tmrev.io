        >A rushing river caresses the life of a small town in southern
        Argentina: Choele Choel. Coco is an eleven-year-old kid who intensely
        wishes to be a grown-up, to be a man. A walk along the river with Johana
        -his new Venezuelan neighbor- initiates Coco in the adult world. But his
        father and life itself slow him down and make him feel small and
        insignificant; just a child. When life gets complicated it is probably
        best to let oneself go with the flow and float down the river like a
        drifting log.</image:caption
