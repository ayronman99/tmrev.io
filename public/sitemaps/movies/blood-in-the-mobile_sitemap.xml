        >The production of phones has a dark, bloody side. The main part of
        minerals used to produce phones is coming from the mines in the Eastern
        DR Congo. The Western World is buying these so-called conflict minerals
        and thereby finances a civil war that, according to human rights
        organisations, has been the bloodiest conflict since World War II:
        During the last 15 years the conflict has cost the lives of more than 5
        million people and 300,000 women have been raped. The war will continue
        as long as armed groups can finance their warfare by selling minerals.
        The Documentary Blood in the Mobile shows the connection between our
        phones and the civil war in the Congo. Director Frank Poulsen travels to
        DR Congo to see the illegal mine industry with his own eyes. He gets
        access to Congo s largest tin-mine, which is being controlled by
        different armed groups, and where children work for days in narrow mine
        tunnels to dig out the minerals that end up in our
        phones.</image:caption
