        >Shilpa Sen starts her day on a wrong note. Her car, just like her luck,
        betrayed her the last moment. She gets frantic calls from bank against
        her credit card loan and threatens to take action against her if not
        paid immediately. Shilpa seems to be one who was born to face challenges
        in life. But she had never let her situation overpower her morale. This
        film deals with 24 hours of Shilpa's life, where she needs to win her
        own battle. A battle that she has been fighting for years. Shilpa needs
        to bake a cake for a high profile couple who plans to celebrate their
        wedding anniversary in Kolkata. Though it might seem to be an easy task
        for any chef, but for Shilpa this was anything but a
        cakewalk.</image:caption
