        >An unrepentant prodigal son straight out of a Russian jail returns to
        his hometown, Asht, to help his mother die with dignity. But his debts
        in his hometown are many and long overdue, the townspeople are tough as
        nails, and he soon gets more than he expected from the quiet village. In
        this dark comedy, his third feature, writer-director Jamshed Usmonov
        cast the population of Asht as its own persuasive self and his own
        mother and brother as the fractured yet formidable domestic
        couple.</image:caption
