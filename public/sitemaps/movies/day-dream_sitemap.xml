        >"In a way, making street films is daydreaming with a camera. It's
        capturing a fantasy you're having when you're wide awake and life is
        going on around you. There is, of course, a similarity between
        daydreaming and making any kind of art because they both spring from
        that narrow groove between the subconscious and the conscious. That's
        when self-expression and technical problem-solving both flow together in
        an almost mystical way. For me this film represents that mental state. I
        shot it in late July 2001 but put it away for some forgotten reason.
        It's very much about everyday lifeâ€“a nondescript New York neighborhood
        on a calm Sunday afternoon, garbage cans piled high, feet reading here
        and there . . . but it's also about the magic I can see in that world
        when I free my subconscious. I made this film so effortlessly (I just
        cut out one brief shot) because I was so fully in that mindset, which, I
        think, shows in the nature of the images."</image:caption
