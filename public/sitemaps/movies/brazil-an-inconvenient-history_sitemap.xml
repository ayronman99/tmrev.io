        >At first glance Brazil appears to be an alluring playground of exciting
        carnivals, sultry samba, divine football and a vibrantly diverse people.
        But behind this dazzling facade lies a disturbing story of history’s
        largest-ever slave population. Astonishingly Brazil, a Portuguese
        colony, received ten-times more African slaves than the numbers
        transported to North America. This programme looks at those estimated 4
        million people with whose blood, sweat and tears Brazil was built.
        Without them none of Brazil’s present-day success and appeal would
        exist. Using contemporary testimonies, this film takes a hard look at
        Brazil s dark history through the eyes of those slaves. They lived in
        squalid conditions on remote plantations or in teeming cities harboring
        fatal diseases. Most Africans survived only seven years in this ‘New
        World’.</image:caption
