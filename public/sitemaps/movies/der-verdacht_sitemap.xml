        >A German energy engineer has been found dead in a burnt-out car off the
        main road in the African Namib desert. The Namibian police rule out an
        accident and the victim's wife and business partner Maja Reichardt is
        suspected to be involved in the death of her husband. She has only two
        hours to convince the German embassy staff of her innocence. If she
        fails she will be transferred to the local judiciary facing months of
        pretrial detention. Unfortunately diplomatic officer Kirsten Buresch who
        has to take the final decision feels that Maja is suffering from
        paranoia and therefore might have had a reason to kill her
        husband.</image:caption
