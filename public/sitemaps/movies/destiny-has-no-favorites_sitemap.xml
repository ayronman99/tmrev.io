        >Ana is a rich, repressed housewife. Much to her annoyance, her husband
        rents out their garden to a soap-opera production, and goes away on a
        business trip. In her dull solitude, Ana follows the shooting from her
        window, and soon becomes just as engrossed in the soap-opera as her two
        maids. When accidentally mistaken for an actress, she ends up being cast
        for a role -to the great dismay of the other actresses and her maids.
        The set soon becomes dominated by gossiping, intrigues and blackmail,
        while the boundary between her real world and the make believe world of
        soap-operas begins to blur. Ana finds herself entangled in a real life
        soap-opera all of her own when she tries to get everything back to
        normal before her husbands comes home.</image:caption
