        >At first sight, 10-year-old Benoît Brisefer, seems like any other
        little boy his age. However, Benoît is endowed with amazing force. All
        the bandits who cross his path learn this to their own cost. But,
        unfortunately, no one is perfect... As soon as he catches a cold, Benoît
        loses his extraordinary physical abilities. Hence he never takes off the
        woollen scarf wrapped around his neck. Brave and very determined, he
        doesn't hesitate a second to take action to defend his friends. So, when
        Poilonez - a well known crook - and his gang decide to focus on Mr.
        Dussiflard, his taxi driver friend, Benoît does all that he can to
        thwart his plans.</image:caption
