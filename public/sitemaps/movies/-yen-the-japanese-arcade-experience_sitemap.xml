        >Imagine a world where video games reign supreme. Five story buildings
        filled with arcade cabinets, old and new, inundate the streets. Welcome
        to downtown Tokyo, Japan. A place where the arcades of the 80s and 90s
        not only still exist, but thrive and have evolved into an elaborate,
        unmatchable gaming experience. 100 Yen is a historical documentary about
        the evolution of arcades and the culture surrounding it - from the birth
        of arcades to the game centers that still thrive today. With a
        predominant focus on the three major arcade genres, Shooting games,
        Fighting games and Rhythm games, 100 Yen explores the culture and
        evolution of arcades through the past and present. Featuring interviews
        with industry professionals, game programmers and designers, casual
        gamers and gaming icons from Japan, Canada, and the USA.</image:caption
