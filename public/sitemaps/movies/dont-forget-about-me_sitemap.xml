        >Buenos Aires Province, a summer in the 30's. Mateo, an ex convict
        anarchist, travels around the Pampa in his old truck, carrying stolen
        hens and the illusion of finding his lost rooster, The King, which, he
        hopes, will lead him to glory at the cockfights. Fate faces him with
        Aurelia and Carmelo, two siblings in search for their father. Wandering,
        uncertain about his final destination, Mateo decides to give them a ride
        southbound.</image:caption
