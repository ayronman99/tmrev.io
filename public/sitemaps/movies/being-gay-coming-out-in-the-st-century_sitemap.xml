        >Today, while gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and transgenders are no longer
        forced to hide their sexual orientation, there is still prejudice and
        discrimination which can make coming out a difficult decision. And there
        are always internal pressures as well. This program presents the
        accounts and stories of people who have recently taken the step of
        coming out. Interviewees and experts discuss the benefits of this
        important transition by examining the six stages of coming to terms with
        one’s sexual identity. They also look at the dangers of running away
        from sexual self-acceptance—such as alcoholism, drug abuse, and
        suicide—and how finding support can greatly assist the
        process.</image:caption
