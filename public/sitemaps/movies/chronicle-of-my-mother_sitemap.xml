        >Best-selling novelist Kosaku Igami has made a career out of using his
        family as fodder for his novels, much to their dismay. When his mother,
        the spirited family matriarch, is diagnosed with dementia, Igami must
        come to terms with the toll his own behavior has taken on his
        increasingly distant family and resolve his own long-simmering
        resentments. Evocative of classic Ozu, this gorgeously wrought epic
        family portrait explores the tenderness and trappings of familial
        bonds.</image:caption
