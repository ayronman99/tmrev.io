        >Filling the cups of classmates with a kettle is the only work
        11-year-old Dong-ku, who is mentally retarded, can do in his school
        life. However, even this small connection with the outside world breaks
        as one day a new water purifier replaces the kettle in his classroom.
        Disappointed badly by losing his only hope to survive in a regular
        school, he finds that every freshman in the junior baseball team is
        required to supply drinking water to other members with a kettle. Though
        knows nothing about baseball, Dong-ku decides to join the team while his
        father, Jin-kyu, is struggling to save his kidâ€™s only shelter, their
        chicken bar.</image:caption
