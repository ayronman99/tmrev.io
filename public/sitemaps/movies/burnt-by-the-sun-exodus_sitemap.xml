        >Epic film about WWII, a sequel to Utomlyonnye solntsem (1994). Evil
        Stalin is terrorizing people of Russia while the Nazis are advancing.
        Russian officer Kotov, who miraculously survived the death sentence in
        Stalin's Purge, is now fighting in the front-lines. His daughter, Nadia,
        who survived a rape attempt by Nazi soldiers, is now a nurse risking her
        own life to save others. In the war-torn nation even former enemies are
        fighting together to defend their land. People stand up united for the
        sake of victory. Written by Steve Shelokhonov</image:caption
