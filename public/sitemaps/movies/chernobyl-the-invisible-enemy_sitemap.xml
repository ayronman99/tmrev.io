        >In Ukraine, on the 26th of April 1986, a catastrophe shook the whole of
        Europe, and the world experienced a fatal day that became engraved in
        its history â€“ A major nuclear accident at Chernobyl turned an entire
        city into a post-apocalyptic ghost town. Tens of thousands of lives were
        ruined. Today, nature has begun reclaiming the area of the exclusion
        zone surrounding the old power plant. But the consequences and the
        suffering are still felt today. Chernobyl is a lesson for the present.
        It warns us about the risks of our ever-evolving modern society. But
        Chernobyl taught us more importantly about the cost of lies. By
        highlighting the flaws in the Soviet Union system, it revealed how they
        can lead to disaster, and how the way we tell information about what
        really happened can cause harm. The past cannot be undone, but we can
        learn from it.</image:caption
