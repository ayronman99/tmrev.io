        >United by terrifying and bizarre circumstances, the janitor, the drunk,
        the bartender, the cop, his perp, and the student security guard must
        fight to undo the professor's work. A dark force is at work in the
        cadaver lab this Christmas and this unconventional band of heroes are
        the only hope the world has against an army of living corpses that are
        quickly recruiting new members. The undead have been given the gift of
        life and it's up to the janitor to take it back.</image:caption
