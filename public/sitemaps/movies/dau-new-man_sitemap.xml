        >Maxim and his comrades-in-arms are participating in top-secret
        experiments into the creation of a new man. The employees of the secret
        Institute are characterised by everything Maxim detests: alcoholism,
        depravity, weak will, loss of ideals, and lack of faith in the future.
        Vika, one of the waitresses in the Institute's cafeteria, falls in love
        with the young communist, though she is scared by his fascination with
        eugenics and his violent tendencies. Vika hopes that her passion and
        tenderness will soften Maxim, while the state security agents keep a
        watchful eye on their developing relationship.</image:caption
