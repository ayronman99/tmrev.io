        >Khogiram (Atul Kulkarni), his wife (Rituparna Sengupta) and their kids
        Pinu (Darsheel) and Rimzim (Zia) belong to a terrorist dominated region.
        Khogiram and Ritu have a hand-to-mouth income working for a tea
        plantation and can barely manage things. The kids are affected by this
        as well. They go to a respectable school as it is Khogiram's ambition to
        give them the educational opportunities he missed. But the financial
        crunch makes it difficult for kids to match the standards of the school.
        They don't have enough money for uniform or shoes. Things become worse
        when Pinu misplaces Rimzim's only pair of shoes in the vegetable shop!
        Rimzim can't go to school without her shoes. They work out a scheme
        where both of them share the same shoes. However, Pinu always gets into
        trouble at school waiting for Rimzim to give him the shoes. He comes to
        know of the Interschool Marathon where one of the prizes is a pair of
        shoes. Pinu plans to run for it and win the shoes for
        Rimzim.</image:caption
