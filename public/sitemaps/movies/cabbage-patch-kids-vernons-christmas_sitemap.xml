        >The Cabbage Patch Kids are putting on a Christmas play at school and
        Vernon's younger cousins Amy and Henry are visiting for the holidays.
        When Missy &amp; Prissy inadvertently imply that Santa is on vacation
        and will not show up for Christmas, Amy and Henry go to Vernon for
        reassurance. Vernon promises them that Santa will visit them on
        Christmas night. As time goes on Vernon becomes worried that Santa may
        be delayed and decides, with the help of the other kids to hatch a plan
        to ensure that Amy and Henry do see Santa.</image:caption
