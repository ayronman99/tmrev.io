        >Bo-ram and Hyeon-woo are friends in the neighborhood that I knew since
        I was young. The two, who were just like children, became adults and
        began to love each other. Bo-ram prefers a lighter love rather than a
        more serious one, and Hyun-woo likes only one woman... Hyeon-woo gets
        help from Bo-ram in many ways to win his favorite Seo-yeon. And as a
        friend, Bo-ram starts a special class for Hyeon-woo... In the midst of
        this, Hyeon-woo realizes that his true love is not Seo-yeon but Bo-ram,
        and he struggles to choose between friendship and love. This is how
        people in their 20s start their own unpredictable love
        story.</image:caption
