        >After being abandoned in the desert by his abusive stepfather, Phillip
        finds himself cruelly cast into a game of life or death until a
        beautiful orphan named Lucy and her boyfriend Jack come to his rescue.
        The three runaways patrol the desert and live as petty thieves, but they
        soon find that the fight for survival against nature may become a fight
        for survival against each other.</image:caption
