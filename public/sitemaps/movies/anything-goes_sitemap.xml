        >When the S.S. American heads out to sea, etiquette and convention head
        out the portholes as two unlikely pairs set off on the course to true
        love... proving that sometimes destiny needs a little help from a crew
        of singing sailors, a comical disguise and some good old-fashioned
        blackmail. This hilarious musical romp across the Atlantic, directed by
        the multi-award-winning Broadway director and choreographer Kathleen
        Marshall, features Cole Porter’s joyful score, including "I Get A Kick
        Out of You," "You’re the Top" and the show-stopping "Anything
        Goes."</image:caption
