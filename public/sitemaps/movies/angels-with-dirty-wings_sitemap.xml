        >Three women - no moral. Morality is the excuse for those who don't dare
        to live their truth.Michaela, Gabriela and Lucy are angels of vice. On
        their motorbikes they ride through the countryside to live their
        pleasure. They could see a lot, but only see themselves. They call
        themselves angels but they are angels with dirty wings. To be a full
        member in the exile paradise of angels, Lucy has to prove herself and
        stand the tests. The new film of Roland Reber and Mira Gittner is an
        anthem of immorality. A holy song of egoism and a painful study about
        our time and a generation who rent their feelings.</image:caption
