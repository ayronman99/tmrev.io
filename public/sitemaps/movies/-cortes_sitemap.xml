        >"3 Cortes" is a collection of three gore-filled shocking short films
        from three Brazilian filmmakers. The first story, "Sozinho", is about a
        man meeting up with a young woman he met earlier in the day. When he
        gets to her place, she has a special surprise in store for him. "Coleção
        de Humanos Mortos" is the second story, and in it a young man is plagued
        by his inner demons, pushing him to satisfy his desire to inflict pain
        on others. Finally, in "06 Tiros, 60ml" a man wakes up to find himself
        trapped inside a hospital with blood-soaked faceless monsters and must
        do what he can to escape, even if that means killing every monster or
        person he comes across.</image:caption
