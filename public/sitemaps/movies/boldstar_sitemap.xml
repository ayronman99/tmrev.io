        >As a child, Selena (Alison) has suffered abuse from her mother’s lover.
        One night, her mother catches them in the act. But instead of protecting
        Selena, her mother believes her lover’s lies and throws her out of the
        house. Left with no other choice, she sleeps in the streets where she
        becomes vulnerable and available to anyone. Fortunately, a kind man
        saves her and stands as her surrogate father. He helps her forget about
        her bad childhood memories. Before long, she enters the showbiz world
        where there is a good chance of being successful but the ghost of her
        traumatic past has been haunting her making it impossible for her to
        move on and pursue a normal lifestyle.</image:caption
