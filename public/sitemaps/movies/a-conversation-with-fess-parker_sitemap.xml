        >“A Conversation with Fess Parker” (17:05) is another interview, edited
        almost exactly like the previous, where Maltin visits the man who played
        Davy Crockett at his winery in California. Memories of how he got the
        part, what it was like to make the series and the reaction from fans are
        all recalled by Parker. This is a low-key documentary, but a very nice
        inclusion for the set. Next we find A Conversation With Fess Parker. For
        this 17-minute and five-second piece, Maltin visits the actor at his
        vineyard and restaurant, and the two reminisce about the series. We
        learn factoids that relate to the production, Parker’s casting, his
        memories of the actors and Walt, and a mix of other elements in this
        decent little interview. In addition to the shots of Maltin and Parker,
        we see some behind the scenes footage as well as stills and clips from
        the series. Note that though the DVD’s case lists interview pieces with
        Buddy Ebsen, these don’t appear.</image:caption
