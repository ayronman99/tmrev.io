        >Major Ranvir Kaul (Amitabh Bachchan) is a POW who was captured along
        with over 50 soldiers by Pakistani soldiers in 1971 during the war
        between India and Pakistan. 33 years later Ranvir's son Gaurav (Akshaye
        Khanna) decides to go on a rescue mission to Pakistan and bring back his
        father who he has not seen since he was a child. Helping him on his
        mission is Khan (Sanjay Dutt) who had successfully escaped from the same
        prison. They steal, kill, and plan to get the prisoners out. This movie
        is inspired by the film The Great Escape.</image:caption
