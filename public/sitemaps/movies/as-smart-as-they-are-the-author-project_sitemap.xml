        >A documentary film tracing the collaboration between One Ring Zero, the
        Brooklyn house-band for McSweeney's Publishing, and an ensemble cast of
        award-winning authors, each of whom contributed original lyrics. Author
        Myla Goldberg torments guest singer Syd Straw with tongue twisting, five
        star vocabulary words. Paul Auster riffs on the ills of Cincinatti and
        the Iraq war. The film's title, in fact, comes from the inspired
        dialogue of a talking cockroach.</image:caption
