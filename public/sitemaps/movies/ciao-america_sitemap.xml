        >Having recently earned his college degree, Lorenzo Primavera (Eddie
        Malavarca) leaves his home in Boston to travel to his family's ancestral
        homeland in Italy -- as was requested by his late grandfather. Upon
        arriving, Lorenzo is offered a short-term position as coach for an
        American-style football team by the team's manager, Giulio Fellini
        (Maurizio Nichetti). As the young American immerses himself in his new
        duties, he makes the acquaintance of Paola Angelini (Violante Placido)
        and the two begin a friendship that quickly blossoms into something
        more. In between spending time with Paola and working with the team,
        Lorenzo also begins investigating his own family's history and learns
        the reason for his grandfather's departure from Italy, as well as why
        his grandfather never returned to visit. As Lorenzo begins to forge an
        identity for himself in Italy -- not to mention strong romantic
        attachments to Paola -- he must eventually decide whether or not to
        return to the States.</image:caption
