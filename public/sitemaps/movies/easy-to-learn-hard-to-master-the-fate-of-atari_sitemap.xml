        >Before Google, Yahoo and even Apple, before the Silicon Valley clich√©
        of informal dress code, skateboards running the corridors and wild
        creativity became commonplace, one company embodied the digital economy
        lifestyle and business style: the one firm coming out of the Age of
        Aquarius was Atari. The story of Atari is two-thirds the story of Nolan
        Bushnell, founder and visionary, and one-third the first and probably
        biggest boom and bust of the new economy some 20 years before the new
        economy even existed. Atari was showing that technology is cool, way
        before the personal computer revolution took place and they were
        reaching out to an ever-growing audience with something that is still
        cool today: video games. Atari literally introduced the digital world to
        the mass consciousness.</image:caption
