        >Considered one of the finest late Naruses and a model of film
        biography, A Wanderer’s Notebook features remarkable performances by
        Hideko Takamine – Phillip Lopate calls it “probably her greatest
        performance” – and Kinuyo Tanaka as mother and daughter living from hand
        to mouth in Twenties Tokyo. Based on the life and career of Fumiko
        Hayashi, the novelist whose work Naruse adapted to the screen several
        times, A Wanderer’s Notebook traces her bitter struggle for literary
        recognition in the first half of the twentieth century – her affairs
        with feckless men, the jobs she took to survive (peddler, waitress, bar
        maid), and her arduous, often humiliating attempts to get published in a
        male-dominated culture.</image:caption
