        >A crush of 450.000 people descended on the grounds of an abandoned
        military base to write history as images of the biggest concert staged
        in Canada were broadcast around the world, in a public declaration that
        Torontos SARS outbreak is over. This concert sprawled across an expanse
        of grass and tarmac equivalent to 540 football fields called Downsview
        Park, and was meant to prove that Toronto was a safe place to visit.
        AC/DC were at the top of their game, proving to all who witnessed, that
        they are truly one of the greatest rock 'n' roll bands
        ever.</image:caption
