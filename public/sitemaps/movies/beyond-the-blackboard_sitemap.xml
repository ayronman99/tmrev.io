        >Inspired by a true story, “Beyond the Blackboard” is about a
        24-year-old first-time teacher who makes a difference in the lives of
        the homeless children she teaches in a shelter’s makeshift classroom.
        Set in 1987 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, this movie tells the story a
        brand-new teacher and Mom who is given a tougher than expected teaching
        job and winds up teaching homeless children in a school that is housed
        in a room and called, literally, The School with No Name. She has some
        personal prejudicial hurdles to cross before she is able to be a true
        teacher for these children and of course there are hurdles like the lack
        of books and supplies.</image:caption
