        >"Dreams on Spec" takes an intimate look at how far people will go - and
        how much they will sacrifice - for the chance to pursue their dreams.
        This feature-length documentary delves into the lives of three aspiring
        Hollywood screenwriters as they pour their hearts into their spec
        scripts, pitch their ideas to anyone who will listen, go to meetings,
        hold table reads, and work at low-level day-jobs - all in the hopes of
        one day seeing one of their beloved creations made into a movie. These
        poignant portraits are intercut with wisdom from a "Greek Chorus" of
        superstar Hollywood creative-types like James L. Brooks, Nora Ephron,
        Gary Ross, and Carrie Fisher to forge a funny and compelling look at
        inspiration, creativity, and solitude in the movie
        industry.</image:caption
