        >Filmmakers Alastair Fothergill and Keith Scholey chronicle a year in
        the lives of an Alaskan brown bear named Sky and her cubs, Scout and
        Amber. Their saga begins as the bears emerge from hibernation at the end
        of winter. As time passes, the bear family must work together to find
        food and stay safe from other predators, especially other bears.
        Although their world is exciting, it is also risky, and the cubs'
        survival hinges on family togetherness.</image:caption
