        >In this film an artist is under 24-hour surveillance. Through a
        continuous circulation of images and sounds, the spectator becomes an
        accomplice and witness to all his movements. During this process we ask
        ourselves not only why we are following the artist in this way but also
        about the meaning and the nature of his work.</image:caption
