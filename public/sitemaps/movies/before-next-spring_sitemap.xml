        >Where is home? For a group of Chinese students studying and working in
        Tokyo, it might be the Nankokute restaurant whose manager has been in
        Japan for years without ever managing to obtain a residence permit. The
        cook left his family in China and hasn't yet managed to have them
        brought over to join him and one waiter's father is sick while the
        other's is a violent alcoholic. An engaging fresco of everyday life with
        touching moments and an authentic, natural atmosphere.</image:caption
