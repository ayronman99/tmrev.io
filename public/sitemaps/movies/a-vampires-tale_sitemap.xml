        >In the Old West, the assassination of an ageing cowboy is thwarted by a
        sultry vampiress, the would-be killer left for dead in the dust. A
        hundred years later an ancient obsidian mirror, long unearthed from the
        Mesopotamian desert, is liberated from an American collector's vault and
        illegally transported to Europe. Jacob, an unscrupulous antiques dealer,
        moves to a remote farmhouse with his pregnant young wife, Lauren, and
        his difficult ward, Rachel. His goals are clear: to pass this
        near-priceless mirror to the highest bidder, and to prevent these two
        women from ripping each other apart. Nearby, a beautiful ornithologist,
        in nocturnal pursuit of the Screech Owl, is disturbed in her hide by a
        couple of noisy hikers. Her efforts ruined, she joins them by their
        campfire, but when one of them is mysteriously mutilated in the woods,
        she and the other are forced to flee and seek refuge at Jacob's farm.
        Something has been unleashed into the dark of that
        night...</image:caption
