        >The video and companion article “Antioch Confidential” examine the
        closed control and destabilization of Antioch College by Antioch
        University. “Antioch Confidential” documents the damage to educational
        processes when “control” is mistaken for “leadership,” and “command” is
        confused with “vision.” The events taking place at Antioch College are a
        case study of recent trends in higher education today. The article and
        video are available for free use by librarians, teachers, educational
        workers and citizens concerned with the seizure of shared resources for
        private interests.</image:caption
