        >Dusty Rhodes is new at Jefferson High, and she sticks out like a...
        well, a cowgirl. Dusty is a real cowgirl from Texas. Her parents are in
        the U.S. Army: her mother a helicopter pilot and her father a Special
        Forces Army Ranger. At first, Dusty is an outcast, but eventually she
        makes friends with a group that includes Savanah, a girl whose father
        was killed while fighting in Iraq three years earlier. Even though
        Savanah is kind of Goth and Dusty is all cowgirl they have a special
        connection and they bond. Dusty gets the school to agree to an
        Equestrian Drill Team and she enlists her new city slicker friends to
        join the team. As Dusty and the team practice, Dusty deals with the
        fears that come with her mother fighting in Afghanistan.</image:caption
