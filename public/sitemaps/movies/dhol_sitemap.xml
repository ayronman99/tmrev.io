        friends who live in a small town in India. Broke, accident-prone, and
        unable to pay rent to their landlady, they are basically slackers with
        Sameer and Gautam having no family, while Pankaj has been kicked out by
        his brother-in-law, and Martand has illicitly borrowed money from his
        maternal uncle, is unable to re-pay it and hence rendered homeless. The
        four find out that they can better their lifestyle by obtaining a bank

        to woo a rich girl, let one of them marry her, and live their life in
        comfort...</image:caption
