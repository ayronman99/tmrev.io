        >A young woman wakes up in a hospital, convinced she is recovering from
        minor surgery only to find herself in a battle of wits with a
        psychiatrist who can't let her leave until she remembers "what happened
        that night." Events turn a darker corner as doctor and patient try to
        unlock not only what traumatic event Anne is suppressing, but also who
        was there, why it happened, and why Anne's subconscious is fighting so
        hard to prevent her from talking about it.</image:caption
