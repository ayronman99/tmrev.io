        >AMERICA'S LONGEST WAR is a documentary about the extraordinary costs of
        the US government's 40-year war on drugs. Drug prohibition has failed.
        Drug usage rates have not declined, and illegal drugs are more
        available-and cheaper-than ever before. At the same time, the costs of
        the drug war are staggering. More than $1 trillion taxpayer dollars have
        been spent. More than 50,000 SWAT raids occur each year. Hundreds of
        thousands of non-violent drug offenders are wasting their lives away in
        prison at our expense. And more than 60,000 people have been murdered in
        Mexico over the past six years. AMERICA'S LONGEST WAR tells the stories
        of some of the victims of the drug war and, more importantly, points to
        a viable alternative approach to drug policy.</image:caption
