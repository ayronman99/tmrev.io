        >In the 1980s, ruthless Colombian cocaine barons invaded Miami with a
        brand of violence unseen in this country since Prohibition-era Chicago.
        Cocaine Cowboys is the true story of how Miami became the drug, murder
        and cash capital of the United States. But it isn't the whole story -
        Pulling from hundreds of hours of additional interviews and recently
        uncovered archival news footage, Cocaine Cowboys has been RELOADED:
        packed with footage and stories that have never been told about Griselda
        Blanco, the Medell√≠n Cartel, and Miami's Cocaine Wars, with firsthand
        accounts by hit man Jorge 'Rivi' Ayala, cocaine trafficker Jon Roberts,
        smuggler Mickey Munday, and others. Cocaine Cowboys: Reloaded recreates
        Miami's Cocaine Wars like you've never experienced it.</image:caption
