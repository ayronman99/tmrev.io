        >Music producer Professor Angel Dust and his wife Kene are arrested at
        Panama airport on their way back to Barcelona. Their daughter is taken
        into custody by the local social services. Angel's brother Mauricio is
        in shock. Forced to park his life in Spain, he flies to Panama to take
        custody of his niece, find a lawyer and seek protection for his brother
        in prison. After two months, he succeeds in bringing his niece back
        home, but has to fly back to Panama for the trial of his brother and
        sister-in-law... His journey will become a contemporary 'odyssey' full
        of overwhelming encounters with characters whose philosophy of life and
        daily routines illustrate some of the human paradoxes to their very
        limits.</image:caption
