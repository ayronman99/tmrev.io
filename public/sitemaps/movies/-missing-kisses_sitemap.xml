        >A young woman's passion has a remarkable effect on a Russian village in
        this comedy-drama with fantasy elements. Sybill (Nino Kuchanidze) is a
        teenager who is sent to a small town in the country to spend the summer
        with her aunt. Despite her tender age, Sybill is ripe and sexually
        aware, and while the initial object of her attention is Alexander
        (Eugenji Sidichin), a widower in his early 40s, she instead pairs up
        with Mickey (Shalva Iashvili), Alexander's teenage son. Mickey quickly
        becomes infatuated with Sybill and is more than happy to indulge her
        fondness for outdoor lovemaking. Between Sybill's carefree, youthful
        sensuality and the appearance of Emmanuelle at the local movie house,
        suddenly love and lust are in bloom all over town.</image:caption
