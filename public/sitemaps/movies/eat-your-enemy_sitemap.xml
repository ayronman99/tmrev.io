        >Eat Your Enemy is a documentary about martial arts and aggression,
        about spirituality, winning and losing, about suffering and vanity. And
        about East and West, muscle and mind power. About masters and students.
        A film full of paradoxes. Violence and its prevention are important
        themes in our society, and we are each involved in one way or the other.
        Aggression is bad, is the prevailing opinion. We, in the West, have
        begun to consider ourselves too civilized to fight. We fight with words
        and on the off chance that something does go wrong, a trauma team is at
        hand. Nevertheless, people continue to have a need to fight; take the
        violence during soccer matches. But in fact, we don't know how to handle
        aggression. In this film, several approaches to the martial arts in the
        West and the East are highlighted. The essence of the film is
        philosophical, but disguised as fight. Not as much a fight against an
        opponent but rather against oneself.</image:caption
