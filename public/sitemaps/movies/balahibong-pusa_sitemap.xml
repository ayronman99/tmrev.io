        >Sarah (Joyce) is not happy about the idea of her mother Vivian
        (Elizabeth) getting married to Michael (Julio Diaz). But when she
        confronts her and Vivian describes how happy she is, Sarah eventually
        gives her consent. Sarah is hesitant about Michael though. She feels
        that Michael desires her but is helpless because he has Vivian's trust
        that Vivian even goes out of her way to the two comfortable with each
        other. All these Sarah confides to her ' friend' Nick (Jay M analo) with
        whom she has a relationship which her mother disapproves of. Ironic but
        Nick also happens to be a mechanic at Michael's shop and is at the same
        seeing Becky (Rica). What Michael witnesses one fateful night turns out
        to be a revelation which eventually decides their fate</image:caption
