        >Is the solution to Switzerland's future to integrate Germany into the
        confederation? After all, like Michael Ringier, CEO of the Ringier media
        group, says, blithely ignoring all minorities, we're very close in
        culture and language. Oskar Freysinger takes out his guitar and sings
        his answer. Politicians from French-speaking Switzerland and Ticino
        think expanding will help the country survive. The former German foreign
        minister thinks the two countries' traditions are too different. The
        banker Oswald Gr√ºbel is worried about Germany's debts, although he'd be
        prepared to take over its assets. With serious interviews interspersed
        with gags (boat people on Lake Constance, the last Habsburger as a
        peasant), Giaccobbo gathers off-the-cuff reactions which reveal a lot
        about the different mentalities. The movie laughs at preconceived
        notions, redefines neutrality and reflects on what designates a nation.
        Switzerland, which loves to teach the world a lesson, will soon
        helvetize the planet, oder?</image:caption
