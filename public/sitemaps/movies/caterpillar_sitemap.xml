        >During the Second Sino-Japanese War, in 1940, Lieutenant Kurokawa
        returns home as a honored and decorated soldier but deprived of his arms
        and legs lost in battle. All hopes, from the villagers and women to
        close family members, turn to Shigeko, the Lieutenant's wife. She must
        honor the Emperor and the country in setting an example for all by
        fulfilling her duty and taking care of the 'god soldier'. Kurokawa prior
        to leaving to fight in the war regularly beat and berated his wife for
        her barrenness and inability to bring him a son. When he returns home as
        an amputee with no hearing and no speech, his wife dutifully attends to
        him, even though he shows little appreciation for her dedicated care.
        His main concerns are getting fed and getting sex. Even in his own
        degraded condition, he manages to berate his wife. Eventually, though,
        his own memories infiltrate and he is haunted by his horrible, sadistic
        deeds, performed while in the duty of the Japanese
        military.</image:caption
