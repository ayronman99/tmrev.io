        >A group of friends in a Tel Aviv suburb get together to watch
        Universong, a Eurovision-like television song contest. They gather to
        watch and are depressed by the lifelessness of the Israeli entry, a
        parody of many recent offerings, a flashy, grating song about "amour."
        Realizing that Anat is distraught over the crisis in her marriage, they
        decide to compose a song to cheer her up. As a lark, they enters their
        cellphone video of it in next year's contest, and it becomes Israel's
        entry.</image:caption
