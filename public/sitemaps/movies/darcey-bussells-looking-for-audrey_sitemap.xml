        >Behind Audrey Hepburn's dazzling image, Darcey Bussell unravels an epic
        tale of betrayal, courage, heartache and broken dreams. For as long as
        she can remember Darcey has been fascinated by Audrey Hepburn: style
        icon, star of Breakfast at Tiffany's, an Oscar winner at 24. Now, Darcey
        follows in Audrey's footsteps through Holland, London, Rome, Switzerland
        and Hollywood to find out more. She discovers Audrey started out as a
        dancer, risked her life in the war and, although adored the world over,
