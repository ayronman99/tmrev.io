        >Being the adventures of a young man whose principle interests are
        movies, New York, and mass murder. CHARM is an ultra low budget black
        comedy about Malcolm - a New Yorker who gets tired of how gentrified,
        tepid and antiseptic it's all become. What's happened to the 'Good ole
        days'?! And so he decides to take matters into his own hands by
        personally starting a crime wave which he hopes will catch on and drive
        real estate value down, opening up the city to bohemians, artists and a
        swell of creativity, just like the supposed good 'ole days of the 1970s
        and 80s. The only problem is: Nobody is paying attention.</image:caption
