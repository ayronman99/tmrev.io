        >Petros is a gay archaeologist who experiences the naked Greek paranoia
        in the center of Athens. Either by choice or coincidence, he comes into
        contact with people who are "different": An Arab immigrant, who comes to
        Greece, a land of "infidels", determined to conquer it by any means; A
        Greek-French cello player, who is burdened by the agony of her alcoholic
        mother; A young Albanian pianist, who carries the curse of his own
        personal genius and divinity; A Greek immigrant, who was repatriated but
        now has nowhere to call home; A bank director, who believes everything
        can be bought, even love; A patrolman, who creates his own version of
        socio-political reality. Petros' contact with these people is in fact a
        traumatic experience. For each encounter he has to pay a price.
        Sometimes the price is material, while other times it's emotional. At
        times it is both. Will the experience gained make up for the
        loss?</image:caption
