        >Rony is the son of a rich man, who craves success as a boxer. In the
        pursuit of fame he pushes aside his family and the one girl who truly
        loved him. Loneliness being his only companion, Rony embraces his dream
        by going back to boxing. In the ring, he realises that life is pretty
