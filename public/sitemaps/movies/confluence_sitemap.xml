        >The Lewiston / Clarkston valley has a rich history. It is here, at the
        confluence of the Clearwater and Snake Rivers, where Lewis and Clark
        camped on their westward journey over two hundred years ago. Residents
        boast that the valley is the gateway to Hells Canyon, that Lewiston was
        Idaho's first capital. However, the valley also has a much darker past,
        one that many know about, but few publicly acknowledge. From 1979 to
        1982, five people disappeared. Only three of the bodies have ever been
        found. All share one suspect.</image:caption
