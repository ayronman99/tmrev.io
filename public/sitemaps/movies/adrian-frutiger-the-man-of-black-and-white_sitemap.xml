        >Adrian Frutiger was one of the most important type designers of our
        time. The Swiss, born in 1928, created more than thirty fonts, including
        the world-famous MÃ©ridien, Univers and Frutiger type families. Less
        well-known are his extraordingary freely conceived works. This film is a
        straightforward, sensitive portrait of the designer and his work which
        presents Adrian Frutiger's achievements and his relationship to nature
        in a new way. All the cinematography is done in High Definition, stills
        of the well-known Swiss cameraman Pio Corradi and the music composed by
        famous Swiss songwriter Hanery Amman add to the very personal
        portrait.</image:caption
