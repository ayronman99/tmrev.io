        >Echo. Shot in Europe, AK, Canada, and the lower 48, Echo will be more
        of an experimental film compared to their last release, 'Stimulus'. The
        focus of this movie will be mainly on big-mountain riding and the
        experience of being a big-mountain rider. It also showcases four women
        riders in this flick: Jessica Sobolowski, Marte-Lise Karlsen, Laura
        Ogden, and Andrea Binning. Each will have an impressive section and a
        story to tell. Also featured will be newcomer Julian Carr, who front
        flips and back flips off cliffs from the range of 60 feet to 165feet.
        Joining him off the 165 footer is JT Holmes and Billy Poole. Heath
        Ordway will have the most well-rounded section with a 14 kink rail,
        backcountry jumps, and some impressive high speed doubles and other
        lines.</image:caption
