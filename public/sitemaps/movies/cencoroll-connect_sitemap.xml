        >Student Yuki has never seen one of the giant monsters she always hears
        about on the news and that threaten her city. But when she meets the
        lethargic Tetsu one day, things change suddenly. Because Tetsu moves
        around the houses with a creature called Cencoroll, which he can control
        with mind control and which can transform into a wide variety of
        objects. But not only Yuki is fascinated by Cencoroll: the boy Shu tries
        to take Cencoroll from Tetsu with the help of his own telepathy monster,
        whereupon the four engage in a bitter fight, in which Yuki also
        intervenes and the entire city is converted into a battle
        arena.</image:caption
