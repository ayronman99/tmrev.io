        >A heartwarming and tender portrait of men whose lives have been forever
        changed by their cats, CAT DADDIES takes us on an inspiring journey all
        across the United States. These nine “cat dads” come from all walks of
        life – a firefighter, a truck driver, a Hollywood stuntman, an ad
        executive turned cat rescuer, a police officer, a software engineer, an
        actor/Instagram influencer, a school teacher and an undocumented and
        disabled immigrant living on the streets of New York City. They couldn’t
        be any more different, but each of them has a compelling story to tell
        and share an unconditional love for their cats. A refreshing and timely
        exploration of modern masculinity, CAT DADDIES shows us how being a “cat
        person” has no gender, and that the unlikely bond between man and cat is
        here to stay.</image:caption
