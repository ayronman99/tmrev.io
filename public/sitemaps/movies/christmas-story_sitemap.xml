        >Hundreds of years ago in Lapland, a little boy named Nikolas loses his
        family in an accident. The villagers decide to look after the orphaned
        boy together. Once a year - at Christmas - Nikolas moves to a new home.
        To show his gratitude, Nikolas decides to make toys for the children of
        the families as good-bye presents. Over the years, Nikolas's former
        adoptive families become many, and soon almost every house has presents
        on its doorstep on Christmas morning. At thirteen, Nikolas is sent to
        live and work with Iisakki, a grumpy old carpenter, who forbids Nikolas
        to continue making presents for Christmas. Gradually, however, Nikolas
        wins Iisakki's trust. Together they begin to look after the Christmas
        traditional that Nikolas has begun. When the aged Iisakki has to leave
        Nikolas and move away, the tradition of Christmas presents is once again
        at risk. Thankfully, Nikolas comes up with a solution that brings
        children joy every Christmas, even continuing to today.</image:caption
