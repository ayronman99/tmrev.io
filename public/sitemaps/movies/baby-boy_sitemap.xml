        >The story of Jody, a misguided, 20-year-old African-American who is
        really just a baby boy finally forced-kicking and screaming to face the
        commitments of real life. Streetwise and jobless, he has not only
        fathered two children by two different women-Yvette and Peanut but still
        lives with his own mother. He can't seem to strike a balance or find
        direction in his chaotic life.</image:caption
