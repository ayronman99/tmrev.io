        >An unidentified body is found in the remains left after a fire in a
        trailer at a run-down caravan park. The owner of the trailer, a young
        drug-addicted woman, is missing, but is she really the victim? And what
        role has the so-called neighbourhood watch from the nearby community
        played? The case is difficult to solve, with everyone involved guarding
        their secrets, regardless of social class. Furthermore, police
        supervisor Klas Fredén decides to go over Martin Beck’s head and recruit
        charismatic, Norwegian homicide investigator, Steinar Hovland. The
        newly-structured Beck group faces the blight of a power struggle. And
        Martin struggles to find his way back to his old self.</image:caption
