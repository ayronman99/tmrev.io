        >Ben has been at war and he's killed. He can't snap out of shock and
        doesn't sleep anymore. Now, Ben is on leave and is due to meet Sophie,
        his girlfriend from home. He hasn't seen her in ages, not since he was
        innocent. Ben arrives at the airport hotel exhausted and hallucinating,
        child-like and dangerous. He doesn't want to hurt Sophie but he may not
        be able to help it. Ben could well be damned, but Sophie will prove he
        isn't and Ben will be innocent again. At least that's one side to the
        story.</image:caption
