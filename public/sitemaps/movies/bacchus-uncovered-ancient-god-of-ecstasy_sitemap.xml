        >Professor Bettany Hughes investigates the story of Bacchus, god of
        wine, revelry, theatre and excess, travelling to Georgia, Jordan, Greece
        and Britain to discover his origins and his presence in the modern
        world, and explore how 'losing oneself' plays a vital role in the
        development of civilisation. Bettany begins in Georgia where she
        discovers evidence of the world's oldest wine production, and the role
        it may have played in building communities. In Athens she reveals
        Bacchus's pivotal role in a society where his ecstatic worship was
        embraced by all classes, and most importantly women. On Cyprus she
        uncovers startling parallels between Bacchus and Christ. Finally,
        Bettany follows the god's modern embrace in Nietzsche's philosophy,
        experimental theatre and the hedonistic hippie movement to conclude
        that, while this god of ecstasy is worthy of contemporary
        reconsideration, it is vital to heed the warning of the ancients -
        "MEDEN AGAN" - nothing in excess.</image:caption
