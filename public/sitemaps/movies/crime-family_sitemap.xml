        >Two brothers are catapulted into a world of sex slavery, drug-running
        bikers and Korean hit men in this high-impact thriller by the writer of
        Ravage. When the girl he has fallen for becomes the latest in a string
        of abducted women, Danny, an ex-con trying to get his life back on
        track, has nowhere to turn but to his brother Michael, a bounty hunter
        with his own version of justice. The action is intense as the brothers
        race against time -- and the Vietnamese mafia -- to save the girl before
        she is forced into drug addiction and sold to the brothels of
        Asia.</image:caption
