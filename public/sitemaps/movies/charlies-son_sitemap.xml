        >The story takes place in a port controlled by Charlie the Greek and his
        criminal band. There are two things Charlie hates: drugs and
        homosexuality. But both are part of his life: he is madly in love with
        Joy who is a junkie, though he denies it even to himself. And regarding
        the homosexuality issue, his right hand, Tony, has an amorous
        relationship with a transsexual who is part of a group of
        trans-prostitutes. Ignoring Charlie's adamant orders, the transvestites
        work the streets around the port, with the help of Tony, who secretly
        supports them</image:caption
