        >Jack is a martial arts-trained cop who is working hard to restore his
        neighborhood back to its glorious past. But a local mob boss called
        Blades makes it worse when he decides to target a small store owned by
        Jack's family. Taking matters into his own hands, Jack uses unorthodox
        methods to ensure Blades' imprisonment. While in jail, the jaded kingpin
        uses his time to plot revenge against Jack and the whole community. Who
        will be the victor?</image:caption
