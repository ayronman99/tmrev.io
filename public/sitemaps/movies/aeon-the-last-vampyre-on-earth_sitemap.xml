        >Fleeing a cataclysm of unimaginable origin, Catherine Murnau finds
        herself trapped in a nightmare while holed up in a crumbling warehouse
        where a crypto classified “human predator,” has been accidentally set
        free. Catherine soon realizes that she is in fact not alone – coming
        face to face with the last Vampyre who is starving from being imprisoned
        in a weakened state for decades. Catherine begins to fear that she may
        have stumbled into her own tomb, but reaches within herself to engage
        with the creature learning more about human history than the world
        outside would dare to face, a truth so alarming and illusion shattering
        that it could only be told by the last Vampyre on Earth.</image:caption
