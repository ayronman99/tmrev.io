        >A groundbreaking documentary on the internationally renowned painter,
        designated by ARTnews Magazine one of the world's top-ten living
        artists. This documentary was shot over a period of four years, from
        1998 through 2002, Agnes Martin's ninetieth year. Interviews with Martin
        are inter-cut with shots at work in her studio in Taos, New Mexico, with
        photographs and archival footage, and with images of her work from over
        five decades. It is a venue for Martin to speak about her work, her
        working methods, her life as an artist, and her views about the creative
        process. She also discusses her film, "Gabriel" and reads from her
        poetry and lectures. In keeping with Martin's chosen life of solitude,
        she alone appears in the documentary.</image:caption
