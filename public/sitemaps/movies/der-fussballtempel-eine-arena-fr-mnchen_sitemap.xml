        >It does not happen every day that a gigantic stadium is built on a
        greenfield: In October of 2001, the citizens of Munich have voted with a
        clear yes for a new soccer stadium in the north of the city. 66000
        soccer fans of FC Bayern and 1860 Munich will find a new common home in
        the futuristic looking structure. But before that stand four years of
        work on a construction site of superlatives. The director Wolfgang
        Ettlich and his cameraman Hans-Albrecht Lusznat have followed the
        construction of the new Munich soccer arena since the first
        groundbreaking. They have recorded several phases of the construction
        and did thereby get to know the microcosmos of a large construction site
        from the inside: The logistic, with which hundreds of construction
        workers have to be coordinated, and the steady grow of the stadium all
        the way to the perfectly conceptualized illuminated structure, with
        VIP-boxes, mass restaurants, and Europe’s largest parking
        garage.</image:caption
