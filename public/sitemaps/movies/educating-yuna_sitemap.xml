        >Yuna is a shy and innocent college student. One day, she meets
        Professor Shibuya, a famous art critic and collector. Yuna is infatuated
        by his personality, and falls in love with him. Professor Shibuya
        invites Yuna to his countryside home, to help him organize his art
        collection. There, she meets Erika and Miho, an S&M queen and her
        mistress. Through them, Yuna is introduced to a new, unfamiliar and
        tantalizing world, which tests the boundaries of her
        acceptance.</image:caption
