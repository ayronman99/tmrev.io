        >So many Israelis still wax nostalgic about that old Friday afternoon
        ritual, back in the times when television had just one channel. Everyone
        would watch the Arab movie of the week, but did anybody ever wonder how
        Israel’s official TV station was able to transcend hostile boundaries to
        obtain these films, and why it insisted on showing movies made by “the
        enemy”? The Arabic-language movie from Egypt let some of us escape back
        to our original homeland, and let others peek out from our “villa in the
        jungle” and catch a glimpse of our neighbors across the border. But most
        of us didn’t really want to see the people whose culture, anguish, and
        aspirations were reflected on our screens. “Arab Movie” brings us the
        stars and the songs, the convoluted plots, and that fleeting moment when
        we shared the same cultural heroes as everyone else in the Middle East.
        But this film about the richness and intensity of Egyptian cinema also
        raises some disturbing questions.</image:caption
