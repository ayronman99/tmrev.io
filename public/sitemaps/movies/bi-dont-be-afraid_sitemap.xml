        >In an old house in Hanoi, Bi, a 6-year-old child lives with his
        parents, his aunt and their cook. His favorite playgrounds are an ice
        factory and the wild grass along the river. After being absent for
        years, his grandfather, seriously ill, reappears and settles at their
        house. While Bi gets closer to his grandfather, his father tries to
        avoid any contact with his family. Every night, he gets drunk and goes
        and see his masseuse, for whom he feels a quiet strong desire. Bi's
        mother turns a blind eye on it. The aunt, still single, meets a
        16-year-old young boy in the bus. Her attraction to him moves her
        deeply.</image:caption
