        >Bonnie didn't rush when Joan, her husband Ross' ex, phoned to warn her
        that she and her daughter, Amanda, were in danger, but when she finally
        arrives she finds Joan stabbed to death. Bonnie and Ross now must take
        in Joan's children - Sam, who feels bitterly abandoned by Ross, and his
        flippant sister. Meanwhile Bonnie and police captain Kessler wonder who
        murdered Joan, why, and what part Nick, Bonnie's brother, had to play.
        Nick was recently released from jail and moved back in with their
        father.</image:caption
