        >Once a major wealthy town, Sulina is a victim of post-communist decline
        and disarray. Ten years after the fall of Ceausescu inhabitants still
        live in poverty. Despite their despair, there is room for dreams and
        humor. The Romanian town Sulina lies right in the no-man's-land of the
        Danube-delta, cut off from the rest of the world. Ten years after the
        fall of the communist regime the people here are worse off than ever.
        Sulina used to be a wealthy trade town. But with the decline of
        communism the economic connections petered out. The film portrays four
        of the region's inhabitants from three generations who just manage to
        get by.</image:caption
