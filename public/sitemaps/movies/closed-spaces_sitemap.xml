        >The first Russian emo-movie, Closed Spaces is a story about the newest
        generation of Russians. Having grown up in Russia's crazy 1990s, an era
        filled with constant and drastic change, these teenagers have no solid
        ground beneath their feet. They are trapped in a strange world in which
        their money-obsessed parents lead senseless lives and even kill each
        other. Vika is twenty years old. She has black fingernail polish, wears
        pink dresses, and is constantly depressed. While working at a pizza
        place, she gets an order for a pizza delivery from Venya, a strange
        twenty year old boy who lives all alone in a deserted apartment in the
        middle of Moscow. Venya suffers from agarophobia, the fear of open
        space. When Vika arrives Venya lets her in and locks the door behind
        her.</image:caption
