        >A few years back tragic events tied the fate of three Catholic priests.
        From then on they meet on every anniversary of the disaster to celebrate
        their survival. On an everyday basis they have their ups and downs.
        Lisowski works at the curia in a big city, has a career and is dreaming
        of the Vatican. Problem is, archbishop Mordowicz, an opulent church
        official who uses his political influence to build the largest sanctuary
        in Poland, gets in his way. The second priest, Trybus, is a village
        parson. He ministers to a poor community and gives in to human
        weaknesses more and more often. Kuku≈Ça is not faring well either.
        Despite his fervent faith, he loses the trust of his parishioners
        actually overnight. Soon the stories of the three clergymen are going to
        join once again.</image:caption
