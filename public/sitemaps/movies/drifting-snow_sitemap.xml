        >Two strangers, Joanne (Sonja Smits) and Chris (Jonas Bonnetta) share a
        winter road trip through rural eastern Ontario. After losing her husband
        John (Colin Mochrie), Joanne faces the rituals of remote rural life on
        her own, while Chris is processing his failing eyesight and the loss of
        his mother and the new responsibility of taking over her old home in the
        country. As their journey together unfolds, their drifting memories
        reveal parallel experiences, helping each of them shift the focus of
        their destination.</image:caption
