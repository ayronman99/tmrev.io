        >Three hit people - two men, one woman, who have never met before are
        placed on a road trip down the East Coast together. The only thing they
        have in common is that they have all worked for the same boss - and, as
        they swap stories, discover that they have all screwed up for this same
        boss in the past. As they share their stories of errors on the job -
        seen through visual, stirring flashbacks - they begin to wonder why it
        was they were put together in the first place and what might be waiting
        for them at the end of their little road trip.</image:caption
