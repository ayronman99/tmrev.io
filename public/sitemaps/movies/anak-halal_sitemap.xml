        >Hisham, a drug dealer, finds himself stuck in a situation where he had
        to hand over his young son to a homeless woman. Hisham is caught and
        jailed. Mariam, who is a few cans short of a six pack raises the baby,
        now named after the famed legend “Indraputra”, in very meager
        circumstances, but full of love and art. They live in a squatter area
        and have neighbors named Bu Leha and Putra’s best friend, Johanna. They
        move to Kuala Lumpur in hopes of a better life, but Putra and Johanna
        inevitably grow up to be street kids, tough and full of conflict. They
        live hand to mouth, but at the same time their poverty does not stop
        them from having strong friendships and at times, to enjoy their
        youth.</image:caption
