        >After serving 10 years in prison due to a drug-induced assassination of
        a rival gang boss Tachibana (Ryo Ishibashi) enters a world that's
        nothing like it was when he went in. Once a respected and feared Yakuza
        mastermind, he now must try and adapt within the confines of the new
        generations vision of honor. As he still garners a somewhat decent
        amount of respect he just tries to get by. Hooking up with a prostitute
        he's been in passing by with he begins to feel some sense of comfort.
        Upon stumbling across her being beaten down by her pimp, Tachibana can't
        just sit by and do nothing. So he commences in putting down an old
        school Yakuza ass whipping, thus beginning a showdown with the "now"
        boss, Sato.</image:caption
