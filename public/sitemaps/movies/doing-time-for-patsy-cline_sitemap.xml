        >Following a passion for country music, Ralph leaves his father’s sheep
        farm in a remote Australian town, armed with a guitar and a plane ticket
        to Nashville, Tennessee. He hopes to hitchhike to Sydney Airport where
        his take-off into a successful country/western singing career will
        hopefully begin. However, fate and his naivety find him hitchhiking with
        a psychotic drug thief named Boyd, and Boyd's mesmerising girlfriend,
        Patsy. The plot then splits into a series of parallels, flash forwards
        and flashbacks. One depicts Ralph’s imprisonment after being framed for
        drug trafficking. The other follows the dramatic ascent of his career to
        hype status and the pairing between the dynamic Patsy and
        himself.</image:caption
