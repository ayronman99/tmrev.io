        >In Capetown, South Africa, in September 1966, Prime Minister Hendrik
        Verwoerd, the architect of apartheid, was stabbed to death in
        Parliament. The course of South African history was changed by the
        assassin, Dimitri Tsafendas, who was written off as mad and condemned to
        twenty-eight years of imprisonment. A Question of Madness tells the
        extraordinary human story of a man, born of a black mother, but
        classified white, who travelled the world in hopeless search of
        sanctuary - eventually returning to the land of apartheid to wreak
        vengeance on the one who symbolized the racism which had haunted his
        life.</image:caption
