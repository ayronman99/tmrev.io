        >Vanni and Linda live in a penthouse apartment for rent in the center of
        Rome. Vanni writes novels, Linda 'cooperates' to his novels. Between a
        vernissage and an exhibition of Basquiat, thay hang out Alfredo and
        Constanza, a couple on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Alfredo is a
        surgeon with the habit of waking up early and has a lover, Constanza is
        a dermatologist with the same habits. With the intent to vent their
        frustrations in their friends' living room, Alfredo and Constanza take
        hostage the couple and recriminate loudly about the past and the
        present. In an impossible attempt to contain them, Vanni and Linda
        eventually take the field and also thrash each other. Someone will end
        up getting hurt by the end of the night.</image:caption
