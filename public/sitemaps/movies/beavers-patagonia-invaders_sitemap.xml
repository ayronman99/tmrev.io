        >In 1940 twenty Canadian Beavers were brought to 'Tierra del Fuego'
        island in southern Patagonia for commercial fur production. However,
        beavers having no natural predators, quickly spread throughout the
        island, causing massive destruction of trees threatening the entire
        Patagonian forests rivers and species. Why wildlife conservationist are
        convinced that 150.000 beavers must be killed? Why some of the most
        recognized specialist are convinced that an eradication is not possible?
        Meanwhile truism is capitalizing on the situation: a man dressed as a
        beaver passes out flyers promoting a famous sky resort: 'Cerro Castor' -
        Beaver Hill. Hunters claim for subsidies, scientists are researching,
        rangers do what they can and restaurants tray to offer beaver meat to
        tourist.</image:caption
