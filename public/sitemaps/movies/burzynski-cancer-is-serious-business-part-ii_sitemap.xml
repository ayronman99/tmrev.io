        >In the compelling follow-up to the internationally award-winning
        documentary, "Burzynski: the Movie,", Part II explores the current
        status of Antineoplastons' clinical testing sanctioned by the United
        States Food &amp; Drug Administration - and features a modern story of
        the struggling journeys of cancer patients being treated today at the
        Burzynski Clinic in Houston, Texas. Since the mapping of the Cancer
        Genome, Burzynski has pioneered an expansion of his therapy, which he
        calls, "Personalized Gene-Targeted Cancer Therapy", where each patient's
        Genomic Cancer Atlas is mapped and a treatment regimen is personally
        tailored for each individual patient - vs. the conveyor belt,
        "one-size-fits-all" approach that current oncology adheres
        to.</image:caption
