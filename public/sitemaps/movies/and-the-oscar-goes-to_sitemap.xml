        >The story of the gold-plated statuette that became the film industry's
        most coveted prize, AND THE OSCAR GOES TO... traces the history of the
        Academy itself, which began in 1927 when Louis B. Mayer, then head of
        MGM, led other prominent members of the industry in forming this
        professional honorary organization. Two years later the Academy began
        bestowing awards, which were nicknamed "Oscar," and quickly came to
        represent the pinnacle of cinematic achievement.</image:caption
