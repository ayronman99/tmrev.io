        >DANUBE HOSPITAL, a portrait of one of Europe’s largest hospitals, shows
        the daily routines and work processes at a powerful and highly complex
        institution. By depicting a modern healthcare facility, DANUBE HOSPITAL
        holds a mirror to our society to show how it deals with health and
        illness, life and death. Nikolaus Geyrhalter observes what goes on in a
        variety of zones, in conference areas, ORs, patients’ rooms, the
        disinfection and pathology departments, and the kitchen. As the film
        visits all these areas, it follows an ingenious principle of a puzzle
        whose pieces produce an effect only when fully assembled. A portrait of
        an institution in which the relationships between processes that are
        invisible to patients and visitors are shown in all their
        precision.</image:caption
