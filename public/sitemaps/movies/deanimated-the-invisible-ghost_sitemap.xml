        >This piece was designed as an installation piece for projection as a
        60-minute loop in gallery spaces. Deanimated is literally displaced from
        the theater environment typical of film spectatorship, slightly blurring
        the boundaries between the spaces of projection and reception.
        "Deanimated: The Invisible Ghost," is based on the 1941 horror film "The
        Invisible Ghost" with the lead actors Bela Lugosi, Polly Ann Young, and
        John McGuire. In "Deanimated" the actors are gradually eliminated and
        thus the narrative loses its coherence. What remains are backgrounds,
        erratic camera movements that seem to move without focus throughout the
        room, capturing ghostly changes in light and shadows. In this project,
        Arnold asks fundamental philosophical questions about human existence
        and presence in absence. Although the actors are missing, they leave
        behind traces (such as smashing bullets together, dust stirring up â€¦)
        and are experienced precisely in their absence as a ghostly, unreal
        present.</image:caption
