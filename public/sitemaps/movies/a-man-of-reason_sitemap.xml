        >After 10 years of incarceration on behalf of his employer, all Su-hyuk
        wants is a normal life - one he hopes will include his former
        girlfriend, Min-seo, and their daughter, In-bi. But once you've
        penetrated the upper echelons of the underworld, normal can prove hard
        to come by. Sometime in the past decade, meanwhile, Su-hyuk's employer
        has adopted an air of legitimacy. These days, the old gang steal and
        murder in the name of urban development. And they want the reluctant
        Su-hyuk on board.</image:caption
