        >James Murphey is a rugged cryptozoologist, who thirty years earlier,
        during a trip to Loch Ness, Scotland, had a fatal encounter with the
        fabled "Nessie" creature that killed his father, and left James with
        deep facial scar. Twenty years later, James is hunting for Nessie, when
        his search leads him to the sleepy town of Pike Island, Ashburn, on Lake
        Superior. Hiring Josh Riley as his guide, James and Josh bond over their
        mutual scientific interests and deceased fathers, while James tries to
        convince Josh's mother, Sheriff Karen Riley, that the 60-foot plesiosaur
        is killing and breeding.</image:caption
