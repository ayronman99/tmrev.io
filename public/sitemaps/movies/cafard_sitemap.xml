        >August 1914. While Jean Mordant is away winning the title of Wrestling
        Champion of the World in Buenos Aires, his daughter Mimi is raped by
        German occupiers in Ostend. Jean swears he will avenge this immoral
        disgrace. With his coach Victor and young nephew Guido, he enrolls in
        the prestigious ACM (Armored Car Division). But the heavily-built
        armored vehicles keep getting stuck in the mud of Flanders. The
        battalion is hastily transferred to the Eastern front. Jean is
        devastated by frustration for he has just learned that Mimi is pregnant.
        But war conditions are ruthless and he and his friends embark on a
        dramatic journey that ultimately will drag them around the
        world.</image:caption
