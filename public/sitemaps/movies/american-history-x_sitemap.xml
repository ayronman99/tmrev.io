        >Derek Vineyard is paroled after serving 3 years in prison for killing
        two African-American men. Through his brother, Danny Vineyard's
        narration, we learn that before going to prison, Derek was a skinhead
        and the leader of a violent white supremacist gang that committed acts
        of racial crime throughout L.A. and his actions greatly influenced
        Danny. Reformed and fresh out of prison, Derek severs contact with the
        gang and becomes determined to keep Danny from going down the same
        violent path as he did.</image:caption
