        >Cruel But Necessary is the story of Betty Munson's strange journey of
        self-discovery and soul-awakening in the traumatic years following the
        revelation, on videotape, of her husband's infidelity. Her marriage
        over, struggling to raise her teen-age son alone, Betty becomes driven
        to discover other secrets that may surround her and so she videotapes
        every aspect of her life during the gradual disintegration of her
        comfortable upper middle-class existence. Sometimes used as an
        eavesdropping device, other times as a confessional, Betty's camera
        dispassionately records the layers of family and personal dynamics. The
        film is seen entirely from the viewpoint of Betty's video camera
        resulting in a "surveillance tape" that is a kind of voyeurism of the
        absurd</image:caption
