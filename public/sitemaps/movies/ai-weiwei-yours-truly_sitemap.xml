        >Ai Weiwei, famous for his large-scale installation work and his dogged
        social justice advocacy, created a career-defining work in 2015 with
        @Large, mounted at Alcatraz, the emblematic site associated with
        egregious incarceration conditions and radical Native American protest.
        At the core of @Large were portraits of prisoners of conscience coupled
        with the opportunity to write letters of solidarity to the imprisoned.
        In her impassioned and powerful film, exhibition curator Cheryl Haines
        visits several current and former prisoners, including American
        whistleblower Chelsea Manning, and learns how these letters were vital
        to their survival. “The misconception of totalitarianism is that freedom
        can be imprisoned. This is not the case. When you constrain freedom,
        freedom will take flight and land on a windowsill.” — Ai
        Weiwei</image:caption
