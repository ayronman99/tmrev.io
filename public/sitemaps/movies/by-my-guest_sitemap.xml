        >The Um family is about to leave for a family trip. However, at the
        house the family arrived to enjoy their break, fired employee, Kim was
        waiting for the family. He screams while holding the limbs of a family
        member who tries to flee from him, and Kim demands payment for his
        discharge. Suffering, the family screams out and asks Um to give him
        what he wants, but Um thinks differently.</image:caption
