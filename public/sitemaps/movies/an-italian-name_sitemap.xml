        >Paolo is an outgoing and handsome real estate broker married to Simona,
        a beautiful woman from the rough outskirts of Rome who has become an
        author of spicy bestsellers and is pregnant with their child. Betta,
        Paoloâ€™s sister and her husband Sandro organise a dinner party with
        Paolo, Simona and their childhood friend, the eccentric musician
        Claudio. During the lively gathering Paolo reveals what he would like to
        name his son, causing reactions to steam up and a torrent of revelations
        to follow reaching climactic proportions.</image:caption
