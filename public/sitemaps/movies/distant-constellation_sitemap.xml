        >This haunted reverie drops us inside an Istanbul retirement home, where
        the battle-scarred residents revel in the cameraâ€™s attention. A
        creaky-voiced woman shares her personal account of the Armenian
        genocide, a sweetly deluded pianist performs a composition before
        confessing his love and a blind photographer fiddles with his flash as
        he points his own camera back at us. All the while, however, the ominous
        transformation of the land is taking place at the hands of construction
        machinery.</image:caption
