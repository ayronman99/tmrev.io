        >After her younger sister, Maya (Chelsea Vale), goes missing and is
        presumed dead, Misha (Christina DeRosa) returns to her seaside hometown
        to help her family and community pick up the pieces from such a terrible
        loss. With distraught family and friends at every turn, Misha begins to
        wonder if her sister’s boyfriend, Peyton (Alec Nevin), may know more
        about her sister’s disappearance than he’s letting on. Soon however,
        Misha finds herself falling for Peyton and starts to believe Maya may
        have been living a double life involving an affair with the town’s
        mayor, Peter (Jason London). This all changes, though, when Maya is
        discovered alive, revealing a truth that could lead to dire consequences
        for both herself and her family.</image:caption
