        >"A Long Journey" tells the story of three siblings who reach
        adolescence in the late 1960's. The documentary's storyline follows the
        youngest brother's travels around the world. Worried that he would enter
        the struggle for freedom against the Brazilian dictatorship, his family
        sent Heitor to London. There however, he dives head on into the
        "Swinging London" and, just like the European and American youth of the
        time period, he experiments with drugs and the mystic allure of India.
        In the nine years he has traveled around the world, from 1969 to 1978,
        he has regularly written to his family. The documentary features
        interviews with Heitor today, his letters and off-screen comments of
        Heitor's sister, LÃºcia Murat, the director of the movie.</image:caption
