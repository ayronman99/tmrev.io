        >When the leading dancer of Lola is murdered in her dressing room on the
        very night of the premiere, terror looms over the dance troupe. With the
        murderer still at large, the coveted role of Lola passes to Tian, a
        talented but introverted dancer with a traumatic childhood. Suspicion
        fanned by jealousy soon leads to hostility and rejection from fellow
        dancers, while figments of childhood memories start haunting her every
        dream. Tian can only seek solace in the arms of her gaffer boyfriend
        Zhen. As the murderer strikes again, Tian begins to realize that all the
        slayings are somehow related to her. No sooner is she inextricably
        sucked into the curse of the role than she starts suspecting Zhen may
        actually be harboring a horrifying secret behind these murders and the
        troupe itself.</image:caption
