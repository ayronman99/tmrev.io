        >It is 1956. Dau is a distinguished Soviet scientist who meets up with
        the love of his youth – Maria, a Greek actress – during her three day
        visit to Moscow. They haven't seen each other for 25 years. Dau is a
        successful and prosperous scientist, but feels excruciatingly
        dissatisfied with his family life. Through Maria he hopes to regain lost
        harmony and beauty, but reality intrudes when Nora, Dau's wife, returns
        home.</image:caption
