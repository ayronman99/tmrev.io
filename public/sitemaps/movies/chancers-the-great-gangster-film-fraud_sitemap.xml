        >Documentary about a bankrupt Jordanian entrepreneur and an unemployed
        Irish actress who hatch a plan to scam £2.5m off the British taxman by
        faking the production of a £20m movie. But they are found out, arrested
        and then bailed. While out on bail, they decide to prove their innocence
        by actually making a film. They hire a former nightclub bouncer, now a
        self-made micro-budget gangster film director. In 2011, Paul Knight
        makes their movie for under £100,000 with a cast of soap and gangster
        movie stars including Danny Midwinter, Marc Bannerman and Loose Women's
        Andrea McLean. The film's title is A Landscape of Lies. But the
        cinematic alibi does not convince the jury when the trial runs in 2013.
        The producers are convicted of tax fraud and given long
        sentences.</image:caption
