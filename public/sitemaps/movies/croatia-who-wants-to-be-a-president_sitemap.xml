        >"Croatia 2000 - Who Wants To Be A President" is a feature-length
        documentary film about dramatic political events that occurred in the
        period between the death of Croatian president Franjo Tudjman and the
        victory of Stipe MesicÃÅ in the presidential elections. Incessantly
        following (sometimes with ten cameras) the most influential figures in
        Croatian political life, cameras witnessed the moments of their biggest
        battle, their greatest victory and crushing defeat, and days of great
        strain, passion and political combat.</image:caption
