        >Mexico City, or "Chilangolandia," is a chaotic metropolis where
        millions of stories take place every day. Some of them are part of this
        fun comedy full of familiar characters and others that defy stereotypes.
        Ramiro is a taxi driver who hopes his problems will end when his nephew
        "El Chulo" becomes a national soccer star. On the other hand, Carmen and
        Miguel are couple who unexpectedly receive a suitcase with a large sum
        of money, just what they need to get out of their financial situation.
        But when the true owners of the cash realize that it fell into the wrong
        hands, endless adventures and misunderstandings break out within this
        complex city.</image:caption
