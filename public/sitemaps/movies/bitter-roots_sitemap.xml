        >BITTER ROOTS: THE ENDS OF A KALAHARI MYTH is set in Nyae-Nyae, a region
        of Namibia located in southern Africa's Kalahari desert, traditional
        home of the Ju/'hoansi. It updates the ethnographic film record begun in
        the 1950s by John Marshall, whose films documented 50 years of change,
        and who together with Claire Ritchie, established a grass-roots
        development foundation, which Adrian Strong (the filmmaker) joined in
        the late 1980s. Through archival footage and discussions with community
        members, this film sensitively examines the problems (lions, elephants,
        conservationists) currently facing the Ju/'hoansi and challenges the
        myth that they are culturally unable to farm. The film investigates the
        perpetuation of this myth by showing how tourists and filmmakers still
        demand to see how people used to live rather than they way they live
        now, and how the Ju/'hoansi cope with such expectations, while
        steadfastly continuing to farm against all the odds.</image:caption
