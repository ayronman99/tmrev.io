        >Subaru and her twin brother Kazuma share a dream in becoming ballet
        dancers, but their passion is discouraged by their father. After
        Kazuma's death from a hereditary illness, dancing became Subaru's only
        happiness and she yearns to lose herself in dance. Her life takes a
        dramatic turn when she runs into cabaret owner Isuzu, who recognizes the
        talent in Subaru and trains her in her nightspot. But to become a
        professional ballerina, Subaru has to overcome harsher challenges than
        merely satisfying the cabaret drunkards. Spurred on by her rivaling
        dance companions, Subaru enters an international dance competition, to
        vie for recognition and a scholarship to any top ballet company in the
        world. Subaru and her companions soon discover that there are more to
        compete than the championship, and tests of friendship, betrayal and
        self-worth come one after another. Gradually the youngsters learn about
        themselves as dancers, as persons and as friends.</image:caption
