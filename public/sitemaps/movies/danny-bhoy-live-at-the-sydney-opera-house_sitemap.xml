        >Scotland’s Danny Bhoy finally delivers his first DVD - after a
        phenomenal year that has seen him become one of the biggest acts on the
        international scene. Last year Danny was the top-selling comedian at the
        Edinburgh Fringe and completely sold out his last two Melbourne Comedy
        Festival seasons. In a comedy scene littered with concept humour
        andart-house themed shows, Danny’s high energy, topical, observational
        style is a breath of fresh air.</image:caption
