        >Alex Truelove is on a quest to lose his virginity, an event eagerly
        awaited by his patient girlfriend and cheered on with welcome advice by
        his rowdy friends. But Alex, a super gregarious dude, is oddly
        unmotivated. A magical house party throws Alex into the presence of
        Elliot, a hunky college guy, who pegs Alex as gay and flirts hard. Alex
        is taken aback but after a series of setbacks on the girlfriend front he
        takes the plunge and learns some interesting new facts about
        himself.</image:caption
