        >A barren soundstage is stylishly utilized to create a minimalist
        small-town setting in which a mysterious woman named Grace hides from
        the criminals who pursue her. The town is two-faced and offers to harbor
        Grace as long as she can make it worth their effort, so Grace works hard
        under the employ of various townspeople to win their favor. Tensions
        flare, however, and Grace's status as a helpless outsider provokes
        vicious contempt and abuse from the citizens of Dogville.</image:caption
