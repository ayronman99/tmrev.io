        >Nirvana's groundbreaking 1991 album NEVERMIND raised the Seattle trio
        to the status of Godhead, forever changing the face of the pop music
        market. "Here we are now, entertain us" may have come and gone as a
        catch-phrase, but as an insight into a generation's bitterly restless
        tide, it ranks right up there with "I can't get no satisfaction." Part
        of the CLASSIC ALBUMS series, this release sheds new light on the
        production and legacy of NEVERMIND through revealing interviews with
        industry insiders. With unprecedented openness, remaining band members
        Krist Novoselic and Dave Grohl discuss the production of individual
        songs, and tell amusing anecdotes about the band's financial struggles
        just before making it big. In addition, NEVERMIND producer Butch Vig
        invites viewers into his studio, where he dissects and examines each of
        the album's tracks. By isolating, examining, and reassembling each
        instrument and vocal track, Vig is able to recreate the manner in which
        the album was produced.</image:caption
