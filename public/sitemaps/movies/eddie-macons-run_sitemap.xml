        >Eddie Macon is running from a nightmare... running to a dream...
        running for his life and his time is running out. He's escaped a Texas
        prison for the second time (risking life imprisonment if caught) to make
        it back to his wife and son. Relentlessly pursued by ruthless truant
        officer, Carl Marzack, who feels he must prove he can still 'get his
        man' by returning Macon to jail at any cost.</image:caption
