        >Brothers Colin and Ewan McGregor follow up their documentary The Battle
        of Britain with a film exploring Bomber Command, a rarely told story
        from the Second World War. The film focuses primarily on the men who
        fought and died in the skies above occupied Europe, with numerous
        examples of individual heroism and extraordinary collective spirit, and
        Colin learns to fly the key aircraft of the campaign: the Lancaster
        bomber. But this is also the story of a controversy that has lasted
        almost 70 years. The program covers six years of wartime operations, and
        traces the obstacles and challenges that were overcome as the RAF
        developed and deployed the awesome fighting force that was Bomber
        Command.</image:caption
