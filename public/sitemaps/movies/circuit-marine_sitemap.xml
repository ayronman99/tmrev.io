        >"All you need is food," the Beatles could have sung if they had been
        inspired by Circuit marine, a whimsical fantasy about our cruel,
        carnivorous world. To be eaten or not to be eaten: that is the question
        for a ginger cat, a goldfish and a colourful parrot which a
        tender-hearted pirate tries to get to live happily together along with
        his hungry crew. We can only wonder who will be the next meal on this
        ship of food. As the ship pitches and rolls to a sprightly gypsy tune,
        the cat relentlessly pursues the goldfish, and even the parrot gets into
        the act. But who is predator and who is prey? Everyone ends up down
        someone's gullet. Isabelle Favez's colourful and humorous film is a
        tasteful reminder that we're all links in the food chain.</image:caption
