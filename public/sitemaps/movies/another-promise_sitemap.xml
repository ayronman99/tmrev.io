        >Taxi driver Sang-gu is an ordinary father who has made a happy family.
        Due to their unfortunate financial circumstances, he is sorry that he
        cannot afford to send his daughter Yoon-mi to university like other
        parents. Yet, with a bright smile on her face, Yoon-mi tells her father
        that she will one day buy him a new car and pay college tuition fees for
        her younger sibling. However, less than two years after Yoon-mi begins
        her job at a large corporate company, she gets seriously ill and returns
        home. Sang-gu is heartbroken to see his young daughter in such a
        condition.</image:caption
