        >Greg Browning, the creator of The Drive Thru series, brings us his
        latest hilariously entertaining and action packed installment "Drive
        Thru Caribbean". Donavon, Benji, Pat O, and Kalani welcome Aussie
        aerialist Yadin Nicol as they get wrapped up in some serious hijinks
        during their search for waves on the thousands of islets, reefs, and
        cayos strewn through the Caribbean. The crew had a chance to surf secret
        reefs in Puerto Rico that broke unlike any other wave they had
        encountered. While exploring Jamaica they hung with the local Rastas
        after long days of scoring warm water perfection on this tranquil island
        nation. The search lead them to the far reaches of the Caribbean where
        they ripped the famous Soup Bowls of Barbados. From riding dolphins to
        riding waves the "Drive Thru Caribbean" puts you in shotgun on this
        hysterical island hopping adventure. Locations: Puerto Rico, Jamaica and
        Barbados.</image:caption
