        >British Ace and hero Albert Ball was perhaps the Allies' best known
        flyer of the Great War. Originally an infantryman, Ball was one of the
        first members of the Royal Flying Corps but, on 7th May 1917, he would
        depart for his last fight. While engaged in a ferocious dog fight with
        the Germans over northern France he was seen heading into heavy cloud
        cover with his machine guns blazing. That was the last time anyone ever
        saw him alive. Official German records claim that Lothar Von Richtoffen,
        brother of the Red Baron, shot Ball down but this was never officially
        confirmed and remains a mystery of the war.</image:caption
