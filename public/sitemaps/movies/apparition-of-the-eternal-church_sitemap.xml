        >The movie captures the responses of 31 authors, musicians, filmmakers
        and dancers to Olivier Messiaen's monumental organ work "Apparition of
        the Eternal Church." Listening to the 10-minute piece through
        headphones, the documentary subjects-most of whom are outsiders to the
        church and do not know what they're hearing-put Messiaen's project to
        the test: Is it possible to portray, through time-bound, invisible
        sound, the spiritual, the architectural, the eternal? The result is a
        collective interpretation improvising its way through an aesthetic
        landscape defined by violent contradictions. Resolution abuts eternity,
        eroticism asceticism, spiritual ecstasy physical torture. Together, the
        music and its interpreters conjure something like what William Blake
        famously called the marriage of heaven and hell.</image:caption
