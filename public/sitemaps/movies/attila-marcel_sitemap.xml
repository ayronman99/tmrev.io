        >Paul is a sweet man-child, raised — and smothered — by his two
        eccentric aunts in Paris since the death of his parents when he was a
        toddler. Now thirty-three, he still does not speak. Paul's aunts have
        only one dream for him: to win piano competitions. Although Paul
        practices dutifully, he remains unfulfilled until he submits to the
        interventions of his upstairs neighbour. Suitably named after the
        novelist, Madame Proust offers Paul a concoction that unlocks repressed
        memories from his childhood and awakens the most delightful of
        fantasies.</image:caption
