        >A Short Film About John Bolton is a darkly hip and hilarious film
        explores the question that torments artists of every medium: "Where do
        your ideas come from?" Renowned artist John Bolton's paintings of
        voluptuous she-vampire nudes have earned this quiet eccentric a
        reputation for having a "damaged imagination." BBC radio personality
        Jonathan Ross buys his pieces, which leads interviewer extraordinaire
        Marcus Brigstocke to find out what the appeal is in Bolton's beautiful
        (but terrifying) artwork. Why does Bolton demand that his gallery
        "monsterpieces" speak for themselves? What does he do with that
        ornamental knife that he carries everywhere? Will Marcus ever learn how
        to operate the camera?</image:caption
