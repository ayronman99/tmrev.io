        >Crows live everywhere in the world except Antarctica and are a part of
        myths and legends in many cultures. Their reputation in the stories
        varies from comical to frightening, godlike or wise, bringers of light
        and bringers of death, though a “murder” of crows refers to a flock of
        crows, and not to anything murderous, at all. They may be all these
        things, but what we are learning is that they are especially smart. New
        research has shown that they are among the most intelligent animals on
        the planet. They use tools as only elephants and chimpanzees do, and
        recognize 250 distinct calls. One particular talent they have been
        discovered to possess is the ability to recognize individual human faces
        and pick them out of a crowd up to two years later – a trick that might
        make even Hitchcock shiver with fright.</image:caption
