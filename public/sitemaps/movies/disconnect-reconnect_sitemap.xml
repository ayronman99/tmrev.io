        >Mark Van Der Poole, his wife, and two teenagers all understand what
        being "connected" is all about: Twitter,Facebook, Cell Phones, iPads,
        GPS - their frantic lives are bound to gadgets too numerous to count!
        This noisy backdrop turns suddenly into awkward silence when a
        mysterious glitch brings the entire communications grid to a sudden
        halt! Sudden with drawl from gadget-driven addictions force the Van Der
        Poole family together against their will, to face the best - and worst -
        in each other as they explore old fashioned fun, family, and faith. In
        the process, they rediscover the real connectedness they haven't even
        realized they had lost.</image:caption
