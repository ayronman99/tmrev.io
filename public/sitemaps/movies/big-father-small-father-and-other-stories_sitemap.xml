        >Saigon, early 2000s. Photography student Vu has just arrived from
        Vietnam's backwaters and is immediately attracted to his handsome
        roommate Thang, who works odd jobs as a bouncer and low-level drug
        dealer. Entranced by the nocturnal rhythms of Thang's world, Vu follows
        him around the city where he meets Van, a ballet-cum-exotic dancer and
        Thang's sometimes-girlfriend.</image:caption
