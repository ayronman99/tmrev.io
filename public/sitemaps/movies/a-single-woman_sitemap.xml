        >A Single Woman is a distinct, lively portrait of Jeannette Rankin (the
        first American woman elected to Congress; also a suffragist, peace
        activist and reformer) that takes us from her childhood in 1880's
        Montana, to her last television interview in 1972. Deliciously
        political, occasionally chilling, ironic and idiosyncratic, A Single
        Woman illuminates the role of the individual in the American legislative
        process with a whimsical amalgamation of storytelling, high-powered
        discourse and communion. The program is a filmed version of the
        successful stage play.</image:caption
