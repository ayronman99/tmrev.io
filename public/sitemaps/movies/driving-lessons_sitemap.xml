        >In John Carpenter's 1978 classic HALLOWEEN, Michael Myers was suddenly
        able to drive a car after having sat in a sanitarium staring at the wall
        since childhood. While the filmmakers addressed this slight plot hole
        briefly in the original movie with a throw away line by Donald Pleasance
        ("Maybe someone around here gave him lessons"), ArieScope Pictures was
        fortunate enough to track down a never-before-seen deleted scene that
        thoroughly explains what really happened.</image:caption
