        >The documentary "Caixa D'água: Qui-lombo is this?" It reports, through
        testimonies from former residents and photographic collections, the
        importance in the cultural and historical scope of the Getúlio Vargas
        neighborhood located in Aracaju, capital of Sergipe. Emphasis is placed
        on black culture and the presence of black slaves and their descendants,
        with the rescue of issues related to their origin, orality, geographical
        location and awareness of their racial identity, showing that, although
        this community exists in an urban area, it still maintains many aspects
        of the quilombo life of the former black slaves in
        Brazil.</image:caption
