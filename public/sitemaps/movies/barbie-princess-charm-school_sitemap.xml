        >Barbie stars as Blair Willows, a kind-hearted girl who is chosen to
        attend Princess Charm School: a magical, modern place that teaches

        loves her classes -- as well as the helpful magical sprites and her new
        friends, Princesses Hadley and Isla. But when royal teacher Dame Devin
        discovers that Blair looks a lot like the kingdom’s missing princess,
        she turns Blair’s world upside down to stop her from claiming the
        throne. Now Blair, Hadley and Delancy must find an enchanted crown to
        prove Blair’s true identity in this charming and magical princess
        story!</image:caption
