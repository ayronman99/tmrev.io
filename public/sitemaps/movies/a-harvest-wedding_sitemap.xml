        >A career oriented woman, Sarah Bloom, who ran away from her small town
        life in Massachusetts, is now living in New York City and poised to
        become the next big wedding planner of the famed NY social scene when
        she's hired to plan the most anticipated wedding of the season. The
        problem: The groom is from Sarah's home town of Williamstown, MA and
        wants the wedding on the family farm which is now being run by the older
        brother who happens to be Sarah's first love. So, can the sophisticated
        city girl navigate the pitfalls of her past, possibly find true love in
        her future, and pull off the wedding of the season even though it might
        not be the one she planned for?</image:caption
