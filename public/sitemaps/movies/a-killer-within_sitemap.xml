        >Addison Terrill, a former district attorney now in a lucrative private
        practice, has what seems to be the perfect life. But life as he knows it
        is turned upside down when he arrives home from work late one night to
        find his wife brutally murdered and his son unconscious in critical
        condition at the hospital. Now, fingered as a suspect by the police,
        Addison must race to find the real killer and prove his innocence before
        it's too late.</image:caption
