        >Academic freedom vs. religious conservatism: How one small town
        university professor battles social norms and challenges students to
        think outside the box. When two former students charged Eastern Illinois
        University music professor Douglas DiBianco with sexual harassment, they
        set off a media firestorm in the small town of Charleston, Illinois.
        Described as impishly provocative, DiBianco is known to use shocking
        language and radical extraneous content to force students out of their
        comfort zones, opening them up to the possibility that art doesn't have
        to be pretty to be valuable. But with the threat of a lawsuit because of
        his morally objectionable lectures looming, Andalusian Doug examines the
        conflict between liberal discussions and religious conservatism in
        academia, whether censorship should exist within a secular university,
        and if DiBianco was wrongfully marginalized because of his radical
        teaching methods.</image:caption
