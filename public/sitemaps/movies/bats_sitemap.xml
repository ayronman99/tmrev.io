        >Following a nuclear power plant meltdown, a nearby village known as
        Nosferatu Village, became radiated, and subsequently abandoned for more
        than a decade. The year is 1984, and the public are now permitted to
        return, and a small group come back to their family home to discover a
        radiated bat living in their attic. The family must survive the night to
        escape, but the monster has other plans as they soon begin to find
        themselves infected with a deadly plague that will kill them if the
        beast doesn't. Waiting for sun to rise, they must figure a way to
        survive the night, battling against the creature.</image:caption
