        >Bling is a documentary film which focuses on the complex relationship
        between “blood” diamonds, conflict, the influence of Hip-Hop music and
        culture, and community development. Produced by VH1 Rock Docs, Article
        19 Films, and UNDP, the film features the participation of Hip-Hop
        artists from the US and Sierra Leone. The objective of the film is not
        to shame people into boycotting diamonds. Instead, it is to raise a
        voice on behalf of the millions of diamond diggers and to help
        disadvantaged communities and entrepreneurs reach their full economic
        potential. Promoting conscious consumerism and using the power and
        influence of the hip-hop music, Bling tries to encourage buying "clean"
        diamonds.</image:caption
