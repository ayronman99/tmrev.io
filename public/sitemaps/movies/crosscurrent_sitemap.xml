        >Mysterious, sublime and elegiac, director Yang Chao’s odyssey blends
        breathtaking images with fantasy, poetry and history to create a complex
        magical universe. From the Shanghai metropolis to the snow-capped Tibet
        mountain, Gao Chun steers his cargo up the Yangtze, a river that has
        nurtured a centuries-old civilization. He comes across An Lu, a
        beautiful woman who appears in a different identity at every port
        recorded by a poetry book. Longing for her company, he realizes she
        gradually turns younger as he journeys upstream. He starts to wonder
        whether An Lu is supernatural or he is traveling not only in space but
        also in time. After passing a pagoda that reverberates Buddha’s voice, a
        flooded town reappeared elsewhere, the grandiose Three Gorges Dam and
        many other places where lives have been transformed, he finally arrives
        at the start of the Yangtze, where he unveils the secret of his past and
        An Lu.</image:caption
