        >A musical comedy set to a hip-hop beat, the feature debut from
        actress-turned-director Blanca Li finds a dedicated young breakdancer
        abandoning his comfortable life in a bid for fame in the U.S.A. Dropping
        out of school and leaving home to escape his overbearing mother,
        18-year-old David dedicates all of his time to perfecting his moves with
        his dance team, the Urban Cycle Breakers. As David and his team begin
        gearing-up to face-off against a rival group of intimidating dancers,
        his dreams of finding romance with Samia and making it to the world
        dance finals in New York finally seem to be coming into
        focus.</image:caption
