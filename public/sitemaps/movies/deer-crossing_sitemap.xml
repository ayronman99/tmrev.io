        >The film centers around retired police detective Derrick Stanswood
        (Mann), who is called by a successful doctor about an unsolved case
        involving his wife Maggy (Cottrel) and their son, Cole (newcomer Kevin
        Fennell). Chasing after loose ends in a backward rural town, Derrick has
        no idea that Maggy has been held captive for the past eight years by
        farmer Lukas Walton (K.J. Linhein, "Jebediah"), who is raising Cole as
        his own son in a wrongful world that holds its own horrors
        (http://mrpotent.com/deerCrossing/).</image:caption
