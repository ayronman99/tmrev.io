        >Fisherman’s son Benjamin - Bennie - Stout is a boy with a heart of gold
        who always gets himself into trouble. His St. Nicholas wish list
        includes a pedal car, just like the one the sneaky mayor’s son Roderick
        has. These are the depression years in the 1930s and because the haul
        falls short, his father stays in Spain a little longer to earn some
        extra money. Bennie now only has one wish left: that his father will
        come home. If need be, he will go and get him from Spain himself. He
        catches Roderick erasing his name from the Bad Children list in St.
        Nicholas’ Great Book when an idea occurs to him. He quickly adds his
        name to the list, which lands him a place in St. Nicholas’ bag. But the
        saint does not understand that Bennie doesn’t mind going to
        Spain.</image:caption
