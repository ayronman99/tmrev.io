        >30-year-old Djemila, a single jurist, at last has her own apartment...
        a few steps away from her parents' place. A French woman of North
        African extraction, she does everything she can to hide her origins.
        Emma, her nutty and broke neighbor, struggles to raise her two children
        alone. Although these two women have nothing in common, a deep
        friendship forms between them because of their mutual love of
        music.</image:caption
