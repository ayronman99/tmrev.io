        >Enter Stalag 69, where torture is just the Beginning for this bloody
        band of Nazi Butchers! Germany, 1945. Stalag 69, a POW camp ruled by the
        sadistic SS commandant Helmet Schultz, is nothing but a blood-soaked
        playground for this perverse Nazi monster who uses his American,
        Russian, and British prisoners in cruel and ghastly biochemical weapons
        experiments. When a group of young, wanton USO girls are captured and
        fall into the hands of Schultz and his battalion of butchers, the
        brutality is turned up and the unsuspecting girls are gored, gouged and
        ground up - all for the pleasure of Schultz and his SS brothers and
        sisters. Now it's up to the rag-tag survivors of the camp to strike back
        against their captors and Escape from Stalag 69, alive or on a
        slab!</image:caption
