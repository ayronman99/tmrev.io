        >In 2012, awarded filmmaker Hernán Zin suffered an accident in
        Afghanistan that changed his life forever. The traumas he had been
        accumulating during 20 years of war reporting suddenly imploded. He
        began suffering depression, loneliness and self-destructive behaviors.
        Searching for answers of what happened to him, Hernán Zin decided to
        interview other journalists. He asked them about their traumas, their
        losses, their fears and their families. DYING TO TELL is the first
        documentary film ever made about trauma in war reporters. It is a brutal
        and torn portrait of war, and a tribute to those who risk their lives
        for the world to be informed. —Contramedia Films</image:caption
