        >Legendary writer Ambrose Bierce was known to be brilliant, cantankerous
        and romantic in all his life's passions, and was revered as one of the
        top storytellers of the late 19th Century. In 1890, he presented his
        recently published collection of Civil War Stories to novelist Gertrude
        Atherton and fledgling young publisher William Randolph Hearst during an
        infamous meeting in Sonol, California. This meeting sets the forum for
        the presentation of three of Bierce's most popular stories including
        "One Kind Of Officer", "Story Of A Conscience" and "An Occurrence At Owl
        Creek Bridge." This acclaimed collection features epic battle sequences,
        deeply conflicted drama and the signature "surprise endings" that
        characterized most of the short stories by Ambrose
        Bierce.</image:caption
