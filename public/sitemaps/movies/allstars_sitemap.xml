        >"All-Stars" is a hilarious commentary on the state of all youth sports
        today, fueled by the outrageous behavior of the desperate sports parent
        living vicariously through his or her child. In the vein of "Best in
        Show", where it's more about the dog owners than the dogs - "All-Stars"
        is about the adults involved in youth sports (parents, coaches, umpires,
        volunteers, board members, etc.) more than the kids. The end result is a
        funny, yet compelling spin on fast pitch softball as well as a unique
        state of affairs on the outlandish antics of a few crazed
        parents.</image:caption
