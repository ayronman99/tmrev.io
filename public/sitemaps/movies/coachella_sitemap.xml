        >Filmmaker Drew Thomas brings California's popular Coachella Valley
        Music and Arts Festival to the screen with a different kind of musical
        documentary that not only showcases performances by some of the hottest
        acts to take the stage, but offers interviews with such musical icons as
        Beck, Joshua Homme, Mos Def, and Perry Farrell as well. From English
        icon Morrissey's performance at the inaugural Coachella Festival back in
        1999 to Canadian indie rockers the Arcade Fire's electric 2005 set, the
        musical acts featured here run the gamut from hip-hop to alternative and
        virtually everything in between. Other artists featured include the
        Pixies, the Flaming Lips, Kool Keith, Radiohead, Saul Williams, and
        Squarepusher.</image:caption
