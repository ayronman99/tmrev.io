        Pole during the Christmas season hoping to find adventure and love in
        sunny California. While Santa watches his daughter through a magic snow
        globe, Annie arrives in L.A. and becomes friends with the owner of Candy
        Cane Inn, Lucy, and her daughter, Mia. She also quickly lands a job at
        Wonderland Toys. Wonderland Toys’ owner, Ted is struggling to stay in
        business selling old-fashioned toys in a digital world. Annie soon
        realizes that she wants Ted’s business to thrive because she has
