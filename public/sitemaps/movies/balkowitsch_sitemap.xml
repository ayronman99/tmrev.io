        >A quirky businessman in his 40s was looking for a creative outlet and
        stumbled upon an archaic form of photography that changed his life's
        path. 8 years later, his Native American wet plate photos are being
        archived around the globe, and his recent portrait session with Greta
        Thunberg at Standing Rock Indian Reservation has been seen by millions
        and is in the vaults of the Library of Congress.- From
