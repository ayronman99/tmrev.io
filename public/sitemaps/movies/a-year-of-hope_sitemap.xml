        >A Year of Hope is about life on the streets of Manila. You will hear
        the horrible stories of Pablo, Justin, and some of the other boys.
        Thankfully their lives change during their year in Stairway Foundation.
        It's an NGO located on an island in the Philippines far away from
        Manila. They're there to get a proper education, eat nutritious food,
        have fun, and be introduced to new things. But sadly even in a place
        like Stairway, the gruesome streets of Manila are still lurking in the
        backs of the children's minds.</image:caption
