        >Rudra Pratap Sharma comes from an aspiring Hindu 'Bramhin' family
        consisting of his dad, Dayashankar, a bank manager by profession, his
        mom Sharda and a much younger sister Gaithri. The family resides in
        Banaras, India; Rudra cannot stand injustice in any form and revolts by
        publicly beating some college-bullies. This forces him and his family to
        relocate to the city of Bombay where Rudra continues to deal with
        wrong-doers by turning them over to the law.</image:caption
