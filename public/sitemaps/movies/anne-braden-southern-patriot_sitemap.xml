        >Anne Braden: Southern Patriot is a first person documentary about the
        extraordinary life of this American civil rights leader. Braden was
        hailed by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in his 1963 Letter from Birmingham
        Jail as a white southerner whose rejection of her segregationist
        upbringing was eloquent and prophetic. Ostracized as a red in the 1950s,
        she fought for an inclusive movement community and mentored three
        generations of social justice advocates. Braden’s story explores not
        only the dangers of racism and political repression but also the power
        of a woman’s life spent in commitment to social justice.</image:caption
