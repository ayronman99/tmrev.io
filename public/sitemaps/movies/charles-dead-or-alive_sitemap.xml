        >On the 100th anniversary of the founding of a watchmaking company in
        Geneva, Charles DÃ© the founder's 50-year-old grandson has had it: he
        speaks eccentrically to a reporter, recognizing his grandfather as a
        craftsman and his son as a businessman, but is evasive about himself. He
        gives his family the slip and moves in with a young couple he meets by
        chance, doing the cooking, reading, drinking, and engaging in
        philosophical discussions with them. The young couple comes to love
        Charles. In secret, he stays in touch with a daughter, and the rest of
        the family hires a private investigator to find him, setting in motion a
        business take-over that threatens his Bohemian happiness.</image:caption
