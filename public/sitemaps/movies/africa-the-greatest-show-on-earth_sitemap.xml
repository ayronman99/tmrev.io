        >Sir David Attenborough takes a breath-taking journey through the vast
        and diverse continent of Africa as it's never been seen before. From the
        richness of the Cape of Good Hope to blizzards in the high Atlas
        Mountains, from the brooding jungles of the Congo to the steaming swamps
        and misty savannahs, Africa explores the whole continent. An astonishing
        array of previously unknown places are revealed along with bizarre new
        creatures and extraordinary behaviours.Using the latest in filming
        technology including remote HD cameras, BBC One takes an animal's eye
        view of the action. The journey begins in the Kalahari, Africa's ancient
        southwest corner, where two extraordinary deserts sit side by side and
        even the most familiar of its creatures have developed ingenious
        survival techniques.</image:caption
