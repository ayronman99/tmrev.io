        >Claire Lynam, restorer in Dubliner City Gallery, loved banker Mark
        Gallagher, who dies in a car crash. Not even pregnant buddy colleague
        Fiona Sullivan can divert Claire. Since Claire painted Mark's portrait,
        he appears to her. Claire clings to this illusion. Fiona drags her to an
        opening party of Sean Bennett's artistic furniture shop. The former arts
        teacher approaches Claire as would be artist and as woman. Claire
        discovers she must let go. As the crash trial approaches, Marks parents
        Gerald and Vera Gallagher contact his ex. Discovering Sean caused Mark's
        fatal accident, Claire breaks up and plans to emigrate to the USA, but
        Fiona reminds her of godmother promises.</image:caption
