        >From different time perspectives, Sloophamer tells the story of
        55-year-old Dirk, who one Friday afternoon returns to his house in the
        pleasant street where he leads a happy life. He is proud of the house he
        has converted into a snug little palace with his own hands. But then,
        suddenly, a wrecker's ball knocks a gaping hole into the outside wall.
        Dirk's wife quickly explains that the house is going to be demolished,
        but the bull-headed Dirk refuses to vacate the place. Still, the
        overseer of the demolition team wants to finish the job before the
        weekend. To 'smoke out' the couple, he makes their situation
        increasingly dire. Water, gas and electricity are cut off and the
        anti-riot squad is even on standby. While Dirk is cheered as a hero by
        sympathisers, the overseer decides to go upstairs and terminate the
        predicament. There, he finds a different man than he had imagined. It
        slowly becomes clear that Dirk is out of touch with
        reality.</image:caption
