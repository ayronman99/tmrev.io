        >It's four years later, and a new group of students has been placed in
        Saturday detention at the infamous and prestigious Crestview Academy.
        When Siouxsie, sophomore 'undercrust,' crashes the party to avenge her
        sister's death, a Saturday detention reserved for the privileged seniors
        of Crestview Academy turns into a date in hell. It's not long before a
        na√Øve pussycat lover, gay drug dealer, smokin' hot preacher's daughter,
        squeaky-clean senator's son, and the uninvited younger outsider find
        themselves locked-up in school with no way out, wondering who (or what)
        has set them up. Hilarity and suspense ensue while each 'bad kid' pits
        one against the other, and one by one each falls victim to absurdly
        gruesome 'accidents' while trying to escape.</image:caption
