        >A chronicle of a day in the life of a Palestinian cab driver in Los
        Angeles, DRIVING TO ZIGZIGLAND, portrays the social struggle of the Arab
        immigrant in post-9/11 America. A film audition typecasts Bashar to play
        an Al Qaeda terrorist role. The utilities are due and Bashar has
        twenty-four hours to make the money. For the remaining hours left until
        tomorrow, an unceasing flow of passengers ride in Bashar's taxi and give
        the Arab cabbie the run around on issues that deal with suicide bombers,
        George Bush, Cat Stevens, the war in Iraq, music, and world geography.
        Bashar's quest to make the money is won until he realizes he has to
        choose between the Department of Homeland Security and his
        family.</image:caption
