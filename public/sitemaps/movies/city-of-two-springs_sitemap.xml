        >In 2017, Mosul was liberated after three years under IS control. The
        battle to reclaim the city had razed it to the ground and displaced
        thousands of civilians who are now trying to return home. Told through
        the parallel stories of Ala' and a senior UN figure leading
        international efforts to rebuild the city, this powerful film profiles
        the efforts to raise a city, and a people, from the
        rubble.</image:caption
