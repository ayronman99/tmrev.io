        >Darrell is a well trained prison bitch looking forward to a night alone
        in his cell getting jacked on the drugs he's had smuggled in, when a
        riot erupts on the floors above. To separate the offenders, three of the
        inmates are placed in Darrell's cell. Always up for a laugh, Darrell
        teases, flirts and annoys his fellow cellies Seth &amp; Lanks, until a
        new boy is placed with them and becomes prey to these wild animals.
        Nothing short of offensive and disgusting, these boys are savage and
        hell bent on abusing, insulting, and degrading each other throughout the
        night. 4 Boys, One Room, &amp; Pure Hell in the Cell, this trashy
        British arthouse, throwback captures the reality of the
        80s.</image:caption
