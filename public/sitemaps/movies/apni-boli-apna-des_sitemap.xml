        >Punjab-based Satkar Kaur initially resents fellow-collegian Sahibdeep
        Singh, believing that he won a number of competitions by resorting to
        unfair means, but eventually falls in love with him. When her sister,
        Amrita, invites her to visit London, she does so, and is introduced to
        Sharandeep, who loves her. Satkar is thrilled when she finds out that
        Sahibdeep also has re-located there and has taken up singing as a
        career. She looks forward to meeting him but faces heartbreak when she
        finds out that he has a gorgeous girlfriend, Raman Kaur, the only
        daughter of aspiring politician, Bikramjit Singh; while back home
        Sahibdeep's father, Arjun, faces trauma and humiliation of losing their
        family home due to unpaid debt</image:caption
