        >Astrid is a comedian who makes people laugh for a living; her husband
        Markus is her manager and the two of them work well together. They have
        a nine-year-old daughter and are expecting their second child. When they
        learn that their child will not be born healthy, they are at first
        optimistic that they will be able to meet this challenge â€“ although they
        have no idea what awaits them. But the closer it gets to the due date,
        the more Astrid begins to worry about the future of her unborn child as
        well as that of her family and her career. After many discussions and
        arguments Astrid realises that the decision that will affect all their
        lives must be made by her alone. What complicates matters further is the
        fact that, as a successful entertainer, she is in the eye of the public
        and the media.</image:caption
