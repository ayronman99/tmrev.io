        >Scott Rantzen (Brady Simenson) is a horror movie loving misfit who is
        teased by the popular students in school. When a date with the very
        popular and very beautiful Erica Carpenter (Stephanie Leigh Rose)
        backfires, he feels as though his life is ruined. Ten years later, the
        gang reunite for their class reunion. Little do they know that someone
        is waiting for them and ready to see that they pay for what they did. Is
        Scott back for revenge and will the old gang survive to tell the tale?
        It'll be more gore for Class of 04.</image:caption
