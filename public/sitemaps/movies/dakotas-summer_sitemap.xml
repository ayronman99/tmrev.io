        >Cowgirls 'n Angels Dakota's Summer tells the story of Dakota Rose, a
        cowgirl and competitive trick rider who finds out at the age of
        seventeen that she was adopted. She secretly sets out to discover the
        truth about her adoption and meet her birth parents while visiting her
        grandfather, rodeo legend Austin Rose. At Austin's ranch on break from
        the Sweethearts of the Rodeo trick riding team, Dakota discovers that
        family is not defined by blood, but rather personal commitment and by
        the love they share. Finally at peace, Dakota trains with Austin in
        order to prepare to rejoin the Sweethearts for their final competition
        against the talented Lone Star trick riding team and become the champion
        trick rider she was destined to be.</image:caption
