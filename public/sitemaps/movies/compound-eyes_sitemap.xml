        >Commissioned by the Exploratorium in San Francisco, Paul Clipson's
        five-part COMPOUND EYES cycle delves into the otherworldliness of the
        natural world. In training his Super-8 camera on insects and other
        "minor" invertebrates, Clipson draws the eye into an unseen realm, one
        so delicate as to simultaneously tempt and refuse the touch. Following
        the surrealist desire to make the familiar strange and the strange
        familiar, Clipson relates this micro-landscape to the built environment.
        Electronic musical motifs supplied by frequent Clipson collaborator
        Jefre Cantu-Ledesma add another layer of inquiry, one tuned to the
        unspoken space between wonder and terror. This first entry in the series
        keys the viewer's vision to a single drop of dew on a blade of glass.
        Wisps of eyelashes, dandelions and insect limbs seem to brush against
        the lens in a trembling intimation of seeing.</image:caption
