        >French filmmaker Laurent Chevallier always wanted to make a documentary
        on an African circus, but there were no native circuses on the
        continent. So Chevallier decided to help found a circus in Guinea. 36
        young people were chosen from the city of Conakry to participate in what
        would become Circus Baobab. A group of French circus artists were
        imported to train the participants for 2 years in acrobatics and
        trapeze. Then the group took their show on the road. This film is
        Chevallier's account of the troupe's inaugural tour in Guinea, from
        March 1 - April 11, 2000.</image:caption
