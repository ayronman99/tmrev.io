        >Mike Kersjes is a special-education teacher and football coach in
        Michigan. Mike doesn’t talk down to his "special" students. He respects
        them, and he believes they’re capable of achieving great things. When
        Mike hears about Space Camp, a competitive education program at the U.S.
        Space and Rocket Center, he gets an idea. Even though the program is
        designed for gifted science students, Mike decides participating in the
        summer program would do wonders for the self-esteem of his young
        students, one in particular who wants to be an astronaut.</image:caption
