        >Corrupt cops, street gangs, "Bratki" in "Bummers" (BMWs) steal and
        "Merins" (Mercedeses), angry truck drivers, beautiful women and death
        are what four friends in a black Bummer who go on a mission from one
        region of Russia to another are about to face in the wasteland of
        small-town Russia. A critique of the policies of Boris Yeltsin, it
        depicted the economic crisis that followed Russia's transition towards a
        free market economy, and with it, a lost generation, with no job
        security, who are pushed into a world of crime and rebellion. Despite a
        modest budget of US$700,000, and a limited cinematic release, it became
        a national hit in Russia as well its soundtrack, popularized by
        'Seryoga's' (Серёга) music video "Чёрный Бумер" ("Black Bummer"). Both
        the film and its soundtrack have won awards, including the prestigious
        Golden Aries from the Russian Guild of Film critics.</image:caption
