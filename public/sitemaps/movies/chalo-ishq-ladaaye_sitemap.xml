        >Popular but lonely Bollywood actress, Rani, lives a fairly isolated
        life, through publicly she is thronged by fans, and has taken to
        drinking alcohol in a big way. Thus intoxicated she runs her vehicle
        into a young man named Pappu, who suffers minor injuries. He recognizes
        her, and tells her that he is her number one fan, and will do anything
        for her. She wants him to kill her double-timing boyfriend, Rahul. He
        agrees to do so, provided she kills his overbearing, aged grandmother,
        to which she agrees. After Pappu completes his gruesome task, he meets
        with Rani, only to be told that she does not recognize him, but when
        presented with proof, she relents and agrees to fulfill her part of this
        trade.</image:caption
