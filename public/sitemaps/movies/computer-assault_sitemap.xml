        >Each of the members of a group of hackers is willing to fight against
        system. Their messages and attacks are political, socially demmanding
        but also playful. Each of them have reasons to have moved to that
        virtual side, where they can be who they can't in real life. However,
        the sudden implication of authorities (pressed by goverment to be
        tougher against hackers)and of a wise and dangerous cracker will cause a
        turn in their crusade. Will they use the enemy's means or their
        ideological motivations imply a respect for law and human
        life?</image:caption
