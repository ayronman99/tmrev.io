        >A lighthearted personal essay on one man’s cleaning compulsion.
        Filmmaker Chris Hansen details his tidying neurosis with the help of his
        family and students. He details coping mechanisms (the fine art of
        stacking) as well as the psychological roots of his problem (a childhood
        mess in the kitchen). CLEAN FREAK tips towards deadpan comedy when
        Hansen stages failed attempts at self-help programs. Perhaps the best
        joke of all is that the film itself wouldn’t exist without its
        director’s obsessive personality.</image:caption
