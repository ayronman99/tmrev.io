        >When the volatile Bo travels to Georgia to visit the grave of her
        father, a well-known trumpeter, she runs into his former childhood
        friend Levan. In search of her roots and a better understanding of her
        father, she decides to hitchhike in Levan's truck. Despite the age
        difference, they gently give in to the love they feel for each other.
        The melancholy trumpet playing of Bo's father accompanies their journey
        through the breathtaking Georgian landscape. In the end, they dare to
        trust each other to the point where both Bo and Levan share their
        darkest secrets.</image:caption
