        >In Europe, they speak of him in holy whispers. In America, he's a
        mysterious footnote. Poised for huge commercial success, Jeff Buckley's
        untimely death kept him on the periphery of popular music. "Amazing
        Grace: Jeff Buckley", a passionately crafted documentary, sets out to
        investigate the extraordinary phenomenon of Jeff Buckley, a deceased
        musician of modest commercial success, with only one full-length album,
        who has become a veritable tour de force of inspiration for artists
        across the globe. Interviews include all four of the Jeff Buckley Band
        members, friends, family, colleagues, critics, DJ's, producers, and
        fans. From Sydney, New York, and London to Memphis, Montpelier, and Los
        Angeles, the film takes viewers on an expansive yet incredibly intimate
        trip through the world of Jeff Buckley, and explores how he continues to
        inspire his fans - from classical composers to rock n' roll superstars
        and everyone in-between.</image:caption
