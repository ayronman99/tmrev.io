        >An ex-con returns to his rural Ontario roots and outwits a corrupt and
        wealthy thoroughbred owner trying to take over a slew of local farms.
        Ray Dokes, a charming ex-ballplayer, returns from jail to discover the
        rural landscape of his childhood transformed by urban development.
        Determined to stay out of trouble, Ray heads to the farm of his old
        friend Pete Culpepper, a crusty Texas cowboy who trains losing
        racehorses and whose debts are growing faster than his
        corn.</image:caption
