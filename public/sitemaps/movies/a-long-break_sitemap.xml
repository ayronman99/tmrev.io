        >After 13 years, Tsitsi initiates a reunion of his former classmates
        with a seemingly harmless cause: they haven't seen each other since
        graduation and the reason for the gathering is to remember school and
        have a drink. However, Tsitsi has a secret motivation: he wants to
        punish his former classmate, Guga, who used to make life difficult for
        the entire class at school. Several male classmates gather at the school
        to drink and talk; as their time together progresses, Tsitsi gets drunk
        and tries to accomplish his goal.</image:caption
