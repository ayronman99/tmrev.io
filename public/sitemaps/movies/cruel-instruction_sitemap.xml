        >The story of 16-year-old Kayla Adams, whose mother, Karen is advised by
        the school’s counselor to send Kayla to get treatment at a youth
        residential treatment center after she gets expelled from school. Kayla
        arrives at the Utah facility on the same day as her roommate Amanda, a
        treatment program veteran who knows exactly what the girls were in for.
        Led by headmistress Miss Connie, the staff uses draconian methods
        including force-feeding medications, arbitrary punishments, solitary
        confinement, verbal and physical abuse to keep the students in line.
        After being pushed to their limits and stripped of their lifelines,
        including any ability to freely communicate with the outside world, the
        two young women must band together to survive and fight to expose the
        abuse before it’s too late.</image:caption
