        >Like every year, André, manager of a company named ALTER NATIVE that
        furnishes sanitary article, invites his seven employees to a quietly
        festive Christmas weekend. Yet, unlike the years before, André has bad
        news. He is terminally ill and wants to hand over his company to one of
        them. He will announce his successor in the course of the weekend. His
        collaborators immediately turn into competitors. When his own son,
        Philippe, whom nobody knew about, makes a sudden appearance, cards are
        redistributed, but suspicion quickly arises that André plays a deceptive
        game. While his employees, in a crazy race behind the back of the
        others, try to make their mark, Philippe tries to understand the obscure
        game his father is playing. And what role does the hotel owner play in
        all this? Jingle bells? Jingle bells!</image:caption
