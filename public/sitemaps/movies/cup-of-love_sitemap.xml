        >Zoe Walker is a food scientist who's been sent to Colombia to design a
        coffee flavor that appeals to millennials. In the village of Salento,
        Zoe meets Diego Valdez, a local plantation owner who is reluctant to
        work with her at first, but allows Zoe to use his coffee beans so long
        as she helps him with the final harvest. As Zoe spends time working the
        land with Diego, romance begins to brew despite their very different
        roots.</image:caption
