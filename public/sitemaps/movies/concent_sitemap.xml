        >In her brother's apartment where he died, Yuki finds a vacuum cleaner
        with its cord still hooked up to the outlet. She discovers that the
        circumstances surrounding her brother's supposed suicide are sketchy at
        best, yet no one has any answers. When she starts having hallucinations
        involving his ghost, however, she seeks some psychological help,
        eventually uncovering some things that she may have wished she'd left
        covered.</image:caption
