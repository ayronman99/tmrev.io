        >Platinum, Million and Dreamz are the members of a highly successful rap
        group called the High Rollaz. They are rich, famous and have very high
        expectations for their next album. Everything is looking good for them
        until one day their lives change. A group of mostly female car thieves,
        led by South Central, crash their record release party with guns in
        hand, robbing the rappers of their ultra exotic sports cars. The result
        of the crime ends with their DJ getting killed and the masters to their
        next album being stolen because it was mistakenly left in one of the
        cars. Left with no answers and not wanting to talk to the police for
        help because of the negative publicity, the crew decides to take justice
        into their own hands. Mixed with action packed drama and special effects
        throughout, the film will keep you on the edge of your seat all the way
        to the explosive finale.</image:caption
