        >From the producers of A Fistful of Barrels comes a new video featuring
        an entirely new wave. The small town of Arica, Chile hosts the ASP World
        Tour's Top 44 at Ex Isla Alacrans during the Rip Curl Pro Search Chile.
        Following hot on the heels of last year's epic sessions at the Mexican
        pointbreak known only as La Jolla, The Search extends its one-of-a-kind
        Floating License to South America, where the world's best face-off with
        one of the most challenging waves to ever host a World Tour event. What
        started out as a question mark became one of the greatest slab duels
        ever held, complete with heat-ending injuries and the spectacle of the
        world's best dry-docked on the shallow Chilean reef, leaving some
        holding their bandaged heads and others simply shaking theirs at a wave
        compared to both Pipeline and Teahupo'o for it's
        ferocity.</image:caption
