        >Kriszti√°n is 36 years old and lives with his mother. He is currently
        unemployed, but he is busy. At night he wears a bat costume and walks
        the streets, pubs and nightclubs of Budapest. He faces drug abuse and
        violence, helps homeless people, troubled citizens, drunken youth and
        anyone who he can. If he sees injustice, violence, misbehavior he
        fights. Due to his unusual appearance, this mostly proves to be enough,
        however, when things get worse, he calls the police.</image:caption
