        >This animated short for children tells the story of Christopher, a
        little boy who didn't want to be called Christopher anymore. Such a
        common name! When Aunty Gail from Trinidad tells him a story about a
        Tiger, Christopher changes his name to Tiger. But then he finds a better
        name. When he has trouble cashing a birthday cheque, he realizes maybe
        he should stick with his original name... or maybe not?</image:caption
