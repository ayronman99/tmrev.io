        >Seville, 2002. A group of young people squat in an abandoned warehouse
        in the Pumarejo neighborhood with the intention of rehabilitating the
        space and creating a social center. After 5 years of squatting, the CSOA
        Casas Viejas is a meeting space for the social movements of Seville,
        financing and supporting different autonomous groups. After resisting a
        first eviction attempt in March 2006, Casas Viejas is under threat
        having to face a trial in February 2007. This video aims to summarize
        what these 5 years of squatting and struggle have been, as well as to
        spread the resistance campaign against the eviction that is taking place
        today.</image:caption
