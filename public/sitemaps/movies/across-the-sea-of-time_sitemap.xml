        >A young Russian boy, Thomas Minton, travels to New York as a passenger
        on a Russian freighter. Close to Ellis Island he gets off and thus
        starts his journey to America the same way as all immigrants in former
        times. Thomas is searching for the family of one of his ancestors, who
        had emigrated decades ago, but once sent a letter home together with a
        sample of his new profession: 3D-Photography.</image:caption
