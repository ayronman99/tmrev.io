        >Armi Ratia is the woman behind the legendary design company Marimekko
        and a worldwide celebrity. A theatre company has taken on the task of
        trying to portray the life and work of this complex person. The sets
        mainly consist of the well-known patterns that we all have grown to
        love. Armi is a brave, risk-taking businesswoman and her passion for her
        company repeatedly takes its toll on her employees, finances and family.
        The company grows while Armi's personal life is shaken by suicide
        attempts and turbulence. In Armi Alive!, Oscar-nominated film producer
        and director JÃ¶rn Donner portrays a fascinating woman with fervent ideas
        about the new Finnish man, her company, fabrics and
        clothes.</image:caption
