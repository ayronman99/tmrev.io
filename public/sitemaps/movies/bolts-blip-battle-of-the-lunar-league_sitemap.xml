        >In the year 2080, the Earth and the moon were at peace. Tired of the
        same old daily routine, the ordinary robots 'Bolts' and 'Blip'
        coincidentally are chosen as battle robots. They join the perennially
        bad 'Thunderbolts' team to fight in the Moon League. However, as the
        competition begins, 'Blip' realizes he has specials powers and soon
        becomes the hero of the planet. Just then, 'Dr. Blood' threatens to take
        over the Earth and 'Bolts', who was jealous of popular 'Blip', teams up
        with Dr. Blood. Now it is left to 'Blip' to face the challenge of saving
        the planet and regaining his friend 'Bolts'.</image:caption
