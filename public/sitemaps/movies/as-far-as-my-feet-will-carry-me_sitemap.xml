        >The German soldier Clemens Forel - determined to be reunited with his
        beloved family - makes a dramatic escape through bitter cold winters,
        desolate landscapes, and life threatening ventures from a Siberian labor
        camp after World War II. 8000 miles and three endless years of
        uncertainty later, he is finally about to reach his destination... An
        edge of your seat drama that celebrates the power of the human spirit
        and the force of will, while inspired and impowered by
        love.</image:caption
