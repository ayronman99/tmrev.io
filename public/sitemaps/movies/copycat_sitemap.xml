        >After 16 years of servicing the printing needs of the community,
        Copycat will be closing its doors. On the final day of business the
        store manager, Sam, leads his crew on a crazy and unpredictable day. The
        staff will entertain a cast of interesting customers. During this final
        day they will encounter two wanna-be rappers that have had an
        unfortunate experience with a tattoo artist, a pair of local celebrity
        Cougars on the prowl, a waitress from "The Wiener Shack" who has a big
        secret, and a worthy challenger to Bob's karaoke crown. Lyssa, the
        copier tech, will spend the day in the center of the mayhem as she
        breaks down the equipment. Joe the bum, who considers the Copycat "the
        home he doesn't have", will need to re-locate. As the staff ponders
        their future plans, the events of the day unfold as they discuss
        important subjects such as UFOs, Chupacabras and the potential upcoming
        Zombie Apocalypse. The final day will culminate in a karaoke battle for
        the ages.</image:caption
