        >Vikram is a happy-go-lucky management student from a top Business
        School of India. He becomes an overnight sensation after a successful
        internet campaign against the radical fundamentalism of moral policing
        in India. This prompts his university teacher - Professor Ranjan Batki,
        to throw him a challenge for yet another internet campaign that would
        help raise money via a non-profit Pottery Club for poor people living in
        Maoists areas of India. Little does Vikram know that he is about to
        become a part of a plot that would risk his life and the nation. He gets
        entangled between two corrupt facets of India - Socialism and
        Capitalism, both of which are deeply rooted in India. It's a story
        inspired from true life incidents of Underbelly India.</image:caption
