        >"Bulldog in the Whitehouse" takes political satire to obscene new
        heights: portraying the Bush administration as a cabal of lustful and
        traitorous gay men who are too busy having sex to notice the empire
        crumbling down around them. An explosive and darkly comic adaptation of
        Choderlos de Laclos' novel Dangerous Liaisons, the film's web of sex and
        deceit centers on Bulldog, a hustler who seduces his way into the
        Washington press corps to gain access to the halls of the political
        elite. At the bidding of his puppet master, a corpulent and power mad
        Karl Rove, Bulldog engages in manipulative trysts with Whitehouse
        hotties like the demure press secretary, the religious leader and the
        confused, imbecilic good ol' boy president himself.</image:caption
