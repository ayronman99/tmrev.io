        >Two travelers’ (a Hong Kong independent director and a Japanese
        musician) motorcycle diaries in northern China from November 2005 to
        February 2006. Forget all the vital intellectual and history garbage and
        get down to the real simple, good human feeling – and express it in a
        simple language that reaches people. No bullshit! (Or all bullshit?)
        Under the sound of the motor, Yanyan’s visual and Dean’s music weaves
        into each other; and shows the healing power of the trip to both the
        Chinese and Japanese souls. Everybody, at a certain point, is a little
        lost and sometimes we just find a connection to someone that helps to
        re-inspire or center us. And that experience we'll never forget. It’s a
        special relationship in real life - a little bit more than friends but
        not an actual romance. They get each other and they both know it's not
        going to go anywhere.</image:caption
