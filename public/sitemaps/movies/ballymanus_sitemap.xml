        >On 10 May 1943, something came ashore on Ballymanus strand in rural
        Donegal, Ireland. The next day, nineteen people, mostly children, were
        dead. A generation of the small townland was lost. Calls for answers
        were silenced by the authorities. No one has been held accountable. The
        disaster is unknown outside of the close-knit community, and barely
        spoken of within it.</image:caption
