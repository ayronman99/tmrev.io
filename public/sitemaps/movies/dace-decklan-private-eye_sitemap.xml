        >Dace Decklan: Private Eye is a comedy about Dace Decklan, a private eye
        who is about to relive his past when virginal Magdalena (Stevie Hall)
        enters his office asking to him to look for her father, Rados, who Dace
        left in the jungles of Rambosia many years before. Given a firm warning
        not to go after the tail by his secretary/lover Pollyanna, Dace finds
        that Magdalena is not alone in wanting to Rados. It seems he has
        invented pills that are more potent than Viagra and his ex-scientific
        partner wants for himself and a mysterious sex-hating religious group
        called the Americans, run by Satan-hating nutcase Reverend Callahan. In
        Rambosia, they find that Rados is not the man he once was, obsessed with
        getting an everlasting erection. Dace and Stevie are confronted by the
        local drug cartel run by Dominguez, who has a plan to use the pills to
        start a plan of world domination involving the Japanese and whales. Can
        Dace save the day and reunite father and daughter?</image:caption
