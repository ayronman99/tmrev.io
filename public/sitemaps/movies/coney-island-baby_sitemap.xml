        >After spending time in New York City, Billy Hayes returns to his
        Ireland hometown. He wants to get back together with his ex-girlfriend
        and take her to America in hopes of opening up a gas station. But

        him, and his ex-girlfriend is engaged and pregnant. Then, Billy runs
        into his old friends who are planning a scam.</image:caption
