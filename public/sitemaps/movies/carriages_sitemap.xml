        >James is unlucky in love. He’s stuck in a routine of all work and no
        play and can’t seem to shake loose from it. The only thing that keeps
        him going is his daily commute to work, which he shares with the girl of
        his dreams. The only downside however, is he can’t pluck up the courage
        to speak to her, and she doesn’t seem to know he exists. With his two
        work colleagues as his only aid, James finds himself caught up in a
        never ending cycle of embarrassing and awkward situations as he attempts
        to win her heart. This is the story of when boy meets girl… But with
        nerves…</image:caption
