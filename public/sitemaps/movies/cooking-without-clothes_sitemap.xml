        >When Jeff quit his engineer job in pursuit of his dream as a
        professional chef, he could never imagine his father’s violent
        objection. By sheer chance, he was discovered by a veteran TV producer,
        Jia Ying, whose cooking program was facing a crisis after their diva
        host, Yang Tai, walked out of the production. Jia Ying managed to turn
        Jeff into an up and coming celebrity chef through professional
        packaging. In the meantime, Jeff’s father joined force with Yang Tai in
        a plot to stop Jeff’s dream and resurrect Yang Tai’s dying
        career.</image:caption
