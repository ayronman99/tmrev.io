        >Dillon Copeland is an attractive, talented teenager who resides with
        his uncle in Colorado. He has a crush on Megan who is also interested in
        him. But Travis, the popular High School jock, likes her too and it's
        only a matter of time before the tension gets out of control. As the
        plot thickens, some VERY disturbing secrets are revealed... the kind of
        secrets that are better kept in the basement. How could Uncle Max keep
        this secret for so long? Promises are made as the story unfolds. And
        promises, even deadly ones, must be kept!</image:caption
