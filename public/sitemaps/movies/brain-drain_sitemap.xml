        >Emilio, a shy, not too brilliant pupil at a humble local secondary
        school, has always harboured a secret love for Natalia, the cutest,
        brightest girl in the class. On the last day of the school year, when he
        finally decides to declare his love, Natalia is awarded a scholarship to
        study Medicine at Oxford. It would seem that all is lost for Emilio, but
        his drop-out school-pals are not ready to throw in the towel. After
        faking qualifications and scholarships, this band of brainless nuts land
        in Oxford, causing havoc in the normally peaceful campus existence. â€”The
