        >Pete Shepherd, a maintenance man at Pea Tree Apartments, has his
        universe pulled inside out in this mysterious tale of twisted suspense.
        Pete and his coworker, the paranoid yet darkly comedic Cass, are
        tormented by freakish murders of outlandish proportion as residents are
        brutally slain, one by one, are left for the men to discover. Clues only
        lead to dead ends in this supernatural thriller, but one common thread
        persists: the murder weapons are all tools belonging to Pete...Who is to
        blame? And who will put a stop to the horrific bloodbath?</image:caption
