        >Heather is a charming free spirit whose self-absorbed fianc√© Roger
        never seems to hear a word that comes out of her mouth. Bobby is a naval
        officer who comes home from serving overseas, looking to start a new
        chapter in his life. Both Heather and Bobby long to meet someone who
        makes them feel like they are at home in this world, but they are
        starting to doubt that person exists. Thanks to two Golden Retrievers,
        Bobby's spirited eleven-year-old niece Myra, and a fun-filled theatre
        production of 'A Christmas Carol,' these two unlucky and unlikely people
        end up falling in love at Christmas. But can they overcome the issues of
        their past and present in order to build a future
        together?</image:caption
