        >A married, homophobic accountant unknowingly intercepts a bribe
        intended for his boss, a corrupt real-estate developer. When thugs try
        to take back the money, they unknowingly chase him into a gay sauna.
        It's there for the first time that he knowingly confronts gay people.
        Fearing for his life, the accountant is forced to accept help from the
        people he would normally avoid and look down upon. At the sauna, he
        discovers new lessons about life, acceptance, HIV/AIDS, and his
        relationships with his own family.</image:caption
