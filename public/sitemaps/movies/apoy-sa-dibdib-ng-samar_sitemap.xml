        >Daniel Giron (Mark Lapid) is an honest cop from the city who returns
        home to the province to aid his father in the latter's fight against
        illegal logging. But they find themselves up against the evil Don
        Valderos (Dick Israel), one of the most notorious and immoral illegal
        loggers in town, who also happens to be the father of Catherine
        (Christine Reyes), a woman he once fell in love with. Together with his
        mother Mercedes (Elizabeth Oropesa) and his friends led by Ogoy-Ogoy
        (Amay Bisaya), Daniel continues the fight his father started. How far
        will Daniel go to fight for what is right? And how far will he go to
        fight for the woman he loves?</image:caption
