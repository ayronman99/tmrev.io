        >After making their way through high school (twice), big changes are in
        store for officers Schmidt and Jenko when they go deep undercover at a
        local college. But when Jenko meets a kindred spirit on the football
        team, and Schmidt infiltrates the bohemian art major scene, they begin
        to question their partnership. Now they don't have to just crack the
        case - they have to figure out if they can have a mature relationship.
        If these two overgrown adolescents can grow from freshmen into real men,
        college might be the best thing that ever happened to
        them.</image:caption
