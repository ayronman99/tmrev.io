        >Kay experiences love and believes that it hurts. So she becomes cold
        and even averse to men. On the other hand, Cecile, who is beautiful and
        flirtatious girl, worships men and money. She is very proud of her
        boyfriend, Raul, a young executive who is already married. She is in
        direct opposite to Salma, who is extremely wealthy but is instead modest
        and very innocent in her relationship, with her materialistic playboy
        boyfriend. Then Salma finds out that her father is having an affair and
        will marry someone who is her age. Meanwhile, the curvaceous Donna has a
        habit of falling in and out of love and is the final wheel in this
        quartet of female friendship.</image:caption
