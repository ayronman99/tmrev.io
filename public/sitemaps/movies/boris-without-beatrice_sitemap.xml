        >Living somewhere in present-day Quebec, Boris Malinowski has achieved
        all his goals. A freethinker, open-minded and proud, he also displays a
        certain arrogance when it comes to his successes. For some time now, his
        wife Béatrice, a Canadian government minister, has been bedridden,
        suffering from a mysterious depression. To escape from his wife’s agony,
        Boris begins a relationship with a colleague, Helga, and gets close to
        Klara, a young woman who works as a maid in Boris’s home. The sudden
        appearance of a stranger in his life forces Boris to come face-to-face
        with the world, with everything he takes for granted, with all his
        certainties.</image:caption
