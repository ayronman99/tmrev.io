        >“Dare Ya!” explores what has made the members of Hong Kong’s most
        controversial band, LMF (LazyMuthaFuckaz), the new “voice of Hong Kong
        youth”. Their music may raise eyebrows with the older generation, but to
        their hardcore fan base, LMF’s point of view is their “voice” and their
        music is the heartbeat–and their hopes, dreams, nightmares, concerns,
        problems, and solutions for their future. As the title of this raw,
        different, relevant, and timely film suggests, “Dare Ya!” is a challenge
        to Hong Kong to take a good look at itself, warts and all, because only
        by facing up to our flaws can we become the “World City” that we aspire
        to. “Dare Ya!” is not just a documentary about the exploits and growth
        of ten ordinary young men from the Estates who just happen to be members
        of a rap band, but a wake-up call for Hong Kong.</image:caption
