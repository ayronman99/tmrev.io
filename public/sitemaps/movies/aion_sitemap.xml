        >A portrait of four abandoned spaces inside the so-called “Zone of
        Alienation” in Chernobyl, Ukraine; a dripping swimming pool, a ruined
        concert hall, a mould-infested gymnasium and an old village church. In
        each room he made a recording of 10 minutes and then played the
        recording back into the room, recording it again. This process was
        repeated up to ten times. As the layers got denser, each room slowly
        began to unfold a drone with various overtones. For the visual
        representation of the four rooms, Kirkegaard explored a variety of
        techniques, working with layers, overexposure and video feedback, that
        can be understood as analogous to his acoustical method.</image:caption
