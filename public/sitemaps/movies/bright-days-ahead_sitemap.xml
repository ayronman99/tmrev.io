        >Bright days ahead? Caroline has retired, at last. A new life lies
        before her: time to take care of her children, her husband, and, most of
        all, herself. However, she soon comes to realize that this new freedom
        is synonymous with boredom and idleness. Especially when she receives a
        membership to her neighborhood’s senior club as a birthday present…
        Reluctant at first, she nevertheless decides to take the plunge. Oddly
        enough, she meets great people there, starting with the young computer
        science teacher, who is far from insensitive to her charms. Caroline
        gradually takes control of her life again and lives a second youth:
        taking a new lover, living new experiences, breaking the rules, not
        doing what’s expected of her… Who said that retirement was the beginning
        of the end and not a new beginning?</image:caption
