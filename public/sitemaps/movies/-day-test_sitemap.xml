        >Martin Taylor has totally lost touch with his family. He has no clue
        who his teenage daughter's friends are, why his son only communicates
        with an electronic sign outside his bedroom door, or why his youngest
        child only watches faith TV. Convinced the family needs to reconnect,
        Martin surprises the wife and kids with a little experiment-he locks
        them in their own home with no power, no heat, no running water, and
        absolutely no contact with the world outside! The sudden holiday
        staycation isn't what the Taylors had in mind for the weekend, but
        they'll have to team up to prove they can survive Dad's wacky mission.
        With a heartfelt message and some persistence, one little member of the
        family helps put their priorities back in the pews, because they'll need
        all the faith they have to get through this!</image:caption
