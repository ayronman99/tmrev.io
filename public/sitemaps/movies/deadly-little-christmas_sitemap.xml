        >Fifteen years after slaughtering his entire family on Christmas Day, a
        psychotic killer flees from the asylum to finish what he started when he
        was just a little boy. Devin Merriman was only eight years old when he
        committed the crime that still haunts his small town. Now the time has
        come to kill again, and the massacre Devin has in mind will make his
        previous murders look like child's play.</image:caption
