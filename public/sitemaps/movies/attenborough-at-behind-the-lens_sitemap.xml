        >As Sir David Attenborough turns 90, this intimate film presents new
        interviews, eye-opening behind-the-scenes footage and extraordinary
        clips from some of his most recent films. The doc, which was made for
        the occasion of Attenborough’s 90th birthday, was shot over seven years
        and follows him as he travels to Borneo, Morocco and the Galapagos to
        shoot wildlife specials. Anthony Geffen, the CEO of Atlantic
        Productions, commented, “This is such a special Attenborough film
        because unusually he is the subject. As I look back over the last seven
        years, I never fail to be amazed by his extraordinary ambition and drive
        to use the very latest technology to communicate the natural world to
        audiences around the globe. This film gives audiences the chance to see
        what it’s like to be on the road with David.”</image:caption
