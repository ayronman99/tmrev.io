        >In October 2007, Pasqual Maragall was diagnosed with Alzheimer's. Once
        past the initial blow, he and his family embarked on a crusade against
        the disease. From the very first step, this film has grown into an
        extraordinary testament. With intelligence, sincerity and an infectious
        spirit, Maragall allows a portrait to be painted of not only himself,
        but also his family and his doctors, in order to leave behind a lasting
        document of his personal fight.</image:caption
