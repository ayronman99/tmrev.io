        >Ancient oceans teeming with life, Norwegian settlers, Native Americans
        and multinational oil corporations find intimacy in deep time. Following
        up his 2009 feature Crude Independence (SXSW), Deep Time is director
        Noah Hutton's ethereal portrait of the landowners, state officials, and
        oil workers at the center of the most prolific oil boom on the planet
        for the past six years. With a new focus on the relationship of the
        indigenous peoples of North Dakota to their surging fossil wealth, Deep
        Time casts the ongoing boom in the context of paleo-cycles, climate
        change, and the dark ecology of the future.</image:caption
