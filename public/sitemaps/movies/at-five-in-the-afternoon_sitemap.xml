        >Nogreh is a young Afghani woman living with her father and her
        sister-in-law, Leylomah, whose husband, Akhtar, is missing. Beyond the
        issue of Akhtar, Leylomah is most concerned with how to feed her baby.
        She cannot provide milk for her baby as her own hunger is preventing her
        from lactating. Nogreh, however, aspires toward a life in a western
        styled democracy. Although the Taliban are no longer in power in
        Afghanistan, traditional forces are still active in the country. Nogreh
        often displays signs of rebellion, such as wearing a pair of white pumps
        instead of the traditional slipper beneath her burqa. But mostly, Nogreh
        wants to be educated. Without her father's knowledge, Nogreh is
        attending a secular girls school. Ultimately, she wants to become
        President of Afghanistan. With the help of a Pakistani refugee who likes
        her as a woman, Nogreh tries to understand exactly what forces led to
        current world leaders being elected, those forces which she wants to
        emulate.</image:caption
