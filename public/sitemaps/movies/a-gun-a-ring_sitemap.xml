        >This film is about six different seemingly ordinary people and how
        their paths cross during a two-week period in Toronto. A young man,
        Gnanam, who attributes all of his failures to his dark past and tries to
        confront it; a dedicated detective, John, who questions his integrity
        after making a fateful call; a teenager, Aathi, who struggles to cope
        with the death of his lover; a compassionate widower, Sornam, who is too
        busy helping others to pay attention to his daughter; a hardworking man,
        Ariyam, who struggles to find purpose after the death of his only son;
        and a brave young war victim, Aby, who tries to have a fresh start after
        being abandoned by her fianc√©.</image:caption
