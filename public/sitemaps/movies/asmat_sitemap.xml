        >The Asmat people live on the southwestern coast of western Papua, a
        land that has long remained free of outsiders, discouraged by the
        Asmats' terrifying reputation as cannibals and headhunters. The film
        tells the story of Rufinus, a 20 year old Asmat, that will be married.
        Before that however, he must capture and kill a cassowary, the great
        solitary bird that lives in the depths of the jungle. Accomplishing this
        task will give Rufinus a sense of belonging to the Asmat people, whom
        their neighbors, the Mimikans call, 'We mana w√©: the men who eat the
        man'. Parallel to the wedding, spectacular and rare stock film retraces
        the history of this terrifying people.</image:caption
