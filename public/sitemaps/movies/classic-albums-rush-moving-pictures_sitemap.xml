        >2112 was the album that saw Rush break through to major chart success,
        going to No.1 in their native Canada and Top 75 in the USA where it
        would eventually be certified triple platinum. Moving Pictures opened
        them to a mass audience for the first time and remains the biggest
        selling album of their career. It also went to No.1 in Canada and went
        quadruple platinum there while hitting No.3 in both the UK and USA. Rush
        members Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson and Neil Peart talk us through the
        making of the albums, together with original producer Terry Brown via
        interviews, demonstrations, archive videos and use of the original
        multi-track tapes.</image:caption
