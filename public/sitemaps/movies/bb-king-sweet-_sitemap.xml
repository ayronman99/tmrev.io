        >BB King live in Africa 1974 In 1974, B.B. King brought the blues back
        to Africa. An audience of 80,000 came to Kinshasha for a three day music
        festival of America's Black and Latin legends for a "Rumble in the
        Jungle" Ali vs. Foreman in the fight of the century. The very air
        sizzled with excitement. Then B.B. filled the night with his raw power,
        searing energy, and heart-stopping emotion. This inspiring classic
        concert, shot by Academy Award winner Leon Gast (When We Were Kings), is
        by far one of B.B. King's greatest performances. Watch B.B. and Lucille
        burn up the stage. If you look closely you can see Ali in the audience
        of the show. Now this classic footage is available on DVD and an
        unforgettable night of music is lived again. Songs To Know You Is to
