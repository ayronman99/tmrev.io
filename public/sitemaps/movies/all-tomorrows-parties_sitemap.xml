        >All Tomorrow's Parties is a 2009 documentary film directed by All
        Tomorrow's People and Jonathan Caouette covering the history of the long
        running All Tomorrow's Parties music festival. Described as a "post-punk
        DIY bricolage", the film was created using footage generated by the fans
        and musicians attending the events themselves, on a multitude of formats
        including Super8, camcorder and mobile phone. All Tomorrow's People is a
        name representing the contributions of these attendees.</image:caption
