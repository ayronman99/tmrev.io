        >Jacob van Oppen, the former strongest man on earth, and his manager
        Orsini, who calls himself "the Prince", make a good living by traveling
        around small South American towns and organizing wrestling exhibitions.
        Arriving in Santa Maria, they are met with uncommon enthusiasm, the
        local newspaper wants to sponsor the fight, helping hands placard the
        town with posters, and an open call is made for a worthy adversary. Ever
        so resourceful, Orsini knows how to find the right combatant, but
        fishing in Santa Maria could lead to a bigger catch than he'd hoped
        for.</image:caption
