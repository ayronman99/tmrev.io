        >Built to Kill is an edgy, hyper-stylish horror anthology about people
        pushed, pulled, and driven to kill. An abused wife tends to the
        post-robbery wounds of her criminal ex-husband, when they are visited by
        a mysterious - and malevolent - preacher. A teenage girl lost in life
        finds belonging in a cult that brings out her darkest side. A man
        trapped in a deadly loop must lure another victim to buy his freedom.
        Two sisters must find a way forward and an unspeakable act is the only
        way to rid them of their abusive father. And a young woman buys her way,
        with flesh and blood, into a secret society.</image:caption
