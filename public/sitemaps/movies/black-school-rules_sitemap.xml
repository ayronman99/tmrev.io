        >Sōra is a high school student who is basically invisible at school. He
        is friends with Chūya, who is an unpredictable character that often
        surprises those around him. Sōra and Chūya both have feelings for the
        same classmate, Kio Machida. The Machida girl refuses to come to class,
        because she doesn't want to dye her naturally brown hair black. Their
        school has unreasonable school rules, especially about uniforms, which
        include requiring all students to have black hair. Sōra and Chūya decide
        to stand up to change their school's black school rules so that Machida
        won’t have to repeat a year of school from missing too many
        classes.</image:caption
