        >Recorded on tour to support At Last, her album of standards, (hence the
        DVD's title), this is also the first time the singer's live show has
        been officially available. Even though she has flown under the radar
        since her mid-'80s heyday releasing only three albums and an EP of
        original material from 1990 until this DVD's appearance in 2004, Lauper
        has stayed active and her vocal chops are as good, if not better than,
        ever.</image:caption
