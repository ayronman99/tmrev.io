        >By June 1942, the Japanese Navy has swept across the Pacific. In an
        effort to change the course of the war, a United States carrier group is
        positioned off the coast of Midway, tasked with springing a trap on the
        enemy. During this pivotal battle, the two-man crew of a U.S. Navy dive
        bomber is forced to ditch in the sea. Set adrift, the men look towards
        their comrades for rescue; namely, the ragtag crew of a PBY Catalina,
        who are sent to search for survivors. Amid the vast openness of the
        Pacific, with days passing and the chance of rescue fading, the men are
        forced to face their own mortality.</image:caption
