        >As part of the Willie Handcart Company, Levi Savage (Jasen Wade) feared
        that leaving late in the season would lead to despair and death. What he
        came to find out is that for every tragedy, there is a multitude of
        miracles. Based on unbelievable actual events, and brought to you by
        filmmaker T.C. Christensen (Praise to the Man, The Work and the Glory),
        17 Miracles will open your eyes to the stories of the Mormon Pioneers as
        you have never seen them before. Something extraordinary is about to
        happen.</image:caption
