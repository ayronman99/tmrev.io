        >On August 1, 1942, a 22-year-old Mexican American man was stabbed to
        death at a party. To white Los Angelenos, the murder was just more proof
        that Mexican American crime was spiraling out of control. The police
        fanned out across LA, netting 600 young Mexican American suspects.
        Almost all those taken into custody were wearing the distinctive uniform
        of their generation: Zoot Suits. The tragic murder and the injustice of
        the trial that followed, coupled with sensational news coverage of both,
        fanned the flames of the racial hostility that was already running rife
        in the city. Within months of the verdict, Los Angeles was in the grip
        of some of the worst violence in its history.</image:caption
