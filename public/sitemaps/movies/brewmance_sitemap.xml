        >The American Craft Beer movement began with a group of restless
        homebrewers searching for something genuine and flavorful. Today it’s
        evolved into a redefinition of beer and an international cultural
        phenomenon. That uniquely American spirit of rebellion and innovation
        survives in two groups of homebrewers from Long Beach, California who
        are looking to open their own breweries and bring their beers to the
        world. These include a Christian father-son team who grew close over
        making beer and a retired rock star looking for the “quiet" existence of
        a brewery owner. With the insight and commentary of legendary brewers
        Ken Grossman (Sierra Nevada), Fritz Maytag (Anchor Brewing), Charlie
        Papazian, Vinnie Cilurzo (Russian River), Sam Calagione (Dogfish Head),
        Jim Koch (Boston Brewing) and others, BREWMANCE reveals the soul of
        craft beer in the heart of America.</image:caption
