        >Ellie Carter is recently graduated and has it all. While celebrating
        with friend and boyfriend, she comes across a milk carton with a picture
        of a missing child that looks a lot like her. As a prank, they call the
        toll free number and she realizes that this person could be her. The
        more she finds out, the closer she gets to getting herself and beloved
        ones killed.</image:caption
