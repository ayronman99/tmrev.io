        >"In a haunting and elgiac work titled Easy to Remember from 2001, prior
        to her turn to drawing, Simpson reanimated the jazz ballad of the same
        name in a film work comprised of fifteen individual singers humming the
        tune, in unison. Their unison is only approximate as each singer appears
        as a disembodied mouth, performing the melody while hearing it through
        headphones. Each mouth represents an individual interpretation, an
        interior moment of attempted mimicry." -Connie Butler</image:caption
