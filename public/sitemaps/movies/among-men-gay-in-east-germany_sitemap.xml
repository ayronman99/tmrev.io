        >More than two decades ago, a country in Europe existed that marked the
        border to a different political and economic system, yet was the very
        heart of the continent. This country, called the German Democratic
        Republic, made Socialism a reality and was home to 17 million people.
        Born in the deep eastern provinces, Ringo Rösener merely witnessed the
        collapse of East Germany as a nation. Ringing in the new millennium, he
        leaves his home town of Anklam to live out his homosexuality – something
        he had never dared to do. Would an openly gay life even have been
        possible in the real Socialist system? Ringo Rösener meets six gay men
        who lived in the GDR. Some of them speak openly about their sexuality
        for the first time in their lives. Little by little, they open up, begin
        to share their own personal stories and talk about their lives in the
        supposedly uniform state.</image:caption
