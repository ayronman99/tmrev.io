        >MÄ±zrap is a 40-year old man who is deemed "no good". He lives in a
        small town in the province of Antakya. His father throws him out as a
        bluff, while scolding him, after Mizrap loses his job. But Mizrap, stung
        by his father's words, calls him on his bluff and leaves his father,
        mother, sister and niece to go on a cross-country trip to stay with his
        old army buddy Salim, who lives in a village near Mersin. Across the
        hard way he meets a number of representatives of marginalized groups in
        Turkish society.</image:caption
