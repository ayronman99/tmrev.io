        >A short film and Azerbaijan-Germany co-production by Berlin filmmaker
        Veit Helmer. A lonely man searches a garbage dump for usable things.
        Beneath a pile of rubbish he finds a life-size shop-window mannequin. He
        takes it home and carefully washes and dresses it. Then he himself
        ready, shaves and gets on his bike with the doll for a trip through the
        oil fields. A group of excited children run after him. He collides with
        a flock of sheep and the mannequin falls into a puddle of oil and sinks.
        The story might have it's sad ending here, but just at this moment, the
        man meets the love of his life...</image:caption
