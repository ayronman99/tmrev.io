        >Nobody likes Joseph, but he didn't really care until his beloved dog
        went missing. Now Joseph is pissed. But the final straw is when his
        girlfriend leaves him and his home is vandalized. Now Joseph decides to
        do something - bringing an old fable back to life about a wolf that was
        black as coal and feared like death. The first targets are foster
        parents Sam and Doris whose sunny fall morning has turned into an
        unspeakable nightmare... Written by C. Hamilton</image:caption
