        >Ben (Webb) and Linda Williams move the family into a dream home in a
        last ditch effort to save their troubled marriage. Despite their good
        intentions, they cannot shake the feeling that they are being watched by
        something. Their unimaginable fears are realized when things inside the
        house take a supernatural and sinister turn. Ben and his family flee for
        their lives, but it is too late. The house isn't finished with them,
        trapping the family in its labyrinth. The Williams must come together as
        never before to fight for their family, their lives and to
        escape.</image:caption
