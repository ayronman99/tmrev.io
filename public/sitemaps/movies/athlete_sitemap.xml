        >A former athlete, Kōhei is a swimmer with a wife and child. One day his
        wife asks him to sign the divorce papers. From shock, he escapes to
        alcohol, finding himself one night in Tokyo’s gay district, Shinjuku
        Ni-chōme, where his fateful meeting awaits with Yūtaka, a beautiful
        twink. Yūtaka makes a living from live sex webcams with men, but his
        dream is to become an anime creator. Yūtaka however is tortured because
        he still hadn't come out to his father who collapsed from illness. Kōhei
        and Yūtaka both carry a cross. They hesitate but can't stop being drawn
        to each other as if they need each other. The two fall for each other,
        even at times hurting the other. Kōhei however begins to struggle about
        what it means "to love somebody" and questions his "sexuality", through
        his contacts with different personalities in the gay district.
        Meanwhile, Yūtaka encounters his gay ex Atsushi, and starts to realize
        he will never be able to be with Kōhei, who is
        gay-for-pay.</image:caption
