        >When Jane Austen, the daughter of a country clergyman, was born in the
        picturesque village of Steventon in Hampshire in December 1775, few
        people could have guessed the impact she would have on the world of
        literature. With just six completed novels, "Sense and Sensibility",
        "Pride and Prejudice", "Mansfield Park", "Emma", "Persuasion" and
        "Northanger Abbey", Jane Austen is one of that rare collection of
        classic authors to have remained popular throughout the ages. Although
        this program touches upon Jane Austen's literary abilities, it is in
        fact far more concerned with the great lady herself, and her own
        fascinating life at a time in England's history when Georgian elegance
        was at its most graceful.</image:caption
