        >Alifu, a 25 year-old Paiwan boy, works as a hair-dresser in Taipei and
        struggles between his dream of getting a sex change operation and
        following his fatherâ€™s footsteps to inherit the title as Chief of the
        indigenous Paiwan tribe. His lesbian roommate, Pei-Zhen, is also his
        best friend and confidante. Sherry, a transgender man, is the owner of a
        drag queen bar. For years, Sherry has been in love with the plumber, Wu,
        even though Wu only sees him as his buddy. Chris, a civil servant, lives
        a dull life. A one-time gig as a drag queen in the bar unexpectedly
        becomes his unique and secret way to relief stress. Chris has no choice
        but to keep this gig a secret from his girlfriend Angie. Across
        different genders and sexualities, the only common ground these people
        share is their search for love, understanding and acceptance. (Source:
