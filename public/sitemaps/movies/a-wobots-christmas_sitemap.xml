        >Zak doesn't like Christmas. He doesn't have any friends (thanks to his
        speech impediment), and every year at the orphanage he works his fingers
        to the bone making toys for other kids. Nobody has ever given him a
        Christmas gift, so what is there to be joyful about? An adventure in
        Scraptown--a junkyard where people dump unwanted robots--leads Zak to
        find kindred spirits in a group of oddball bots with their own special
        quirks. While on the run from a wacky scientist bent on taking over the
        orphanage, Zak and his new friends learn a powerful lesson about how
        Christmas started with a baby named Jesus--who grew up to save the
        world. Inspired to embrace their true potential, Zak and the Wobots jump
        into action to save the holiday!</image:caption
