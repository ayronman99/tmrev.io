        >The search for the national best cabin crew is on again. Every steward
        and stewardess is anxious and looking forward to the competition. The
        top 12 finalists are finally selected, including Dania and Tania. Bella
        is the winner of the previous year's competition from a competitor's
        airline who is beautiful, graceful, super-efficient, young, and an
        overall favourite as the winner. Curious to find out what is so special
        about Tania, Dania sneaks on board one of Tania's flights without
        thinking in order to check out how Tania treats the passengers and how
        she performs her on-board tasks. But Dania is unlucky, just minutes
        after sneaking in, a load of passengers come in, and Dania is unable to
        get out. Then the plane takes off. What will happen to Dania
        now?</image:caption
