        >In 2013, the filmmaker’s ownership of a work was revoked by his
        commissioners. In response, he distributed 100 copies of the award
        certificate and re-rendered the film 100 times on DVD, the quality of
        each successive version increasingly degraded until the original work
        became unrecognisable. Each DVD was sold as an edition of the film for
        100 baht. The performance is compared to the replacement of the Khana
        Ratsadon plaque—a symbol of democracy in Thailand — with a royalist
        plaque after it mysteriously vanishes. But it is resurrected in various
        guises and contexts, including the aforementioned DVD. By destabilising
        the notion of authenticity, this tongue-in- cheek docufiction embraces
        meaning-making from below as resistance in a totalitarian
        regime.</image:caption
