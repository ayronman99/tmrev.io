        >The story of CC2 centers around an investigative journalist named
        Stanley Mouse, who wants to find out about the legend of an ancient "cat
        tribe" lost in Africa. He finds them and much more, once again
        threatening the continued existence of mouse civilization. Special Agent
        Grabowsky will act to save the day, however. The events are supposed to
        take place at least 10, possibly 20 years after the first episode, as
        one of the already leaked cells shows the titular Cat-Catcher mecha
        rusting away in a shelter.</image:caption
