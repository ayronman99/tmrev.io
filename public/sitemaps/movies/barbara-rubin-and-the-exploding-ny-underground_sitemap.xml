        >The 29-minute experimental film Christmas on Earth caused a sensation
        when it first screened in New York City in 1964. Its orgy scenes, double
        projections and overlapping images shattered artistic conventions and
        announced a powerful new voice in the city's underground film scene. All
        the more remarkable, that vision belonged to a teenager, 18-year-old
        Barbara Rubin. A Zelig of the '60s, she introduced Andy Warhol to the
        Velvet Underground, Bob Dylan to Kabbalah and bewitched Allen Ginsberg.
        The same unbridled creativity that inspired her to make films when women
        simply didn't, saw her breach yet another male domain, Orthodox Judaism,
        before her mysterious death at 35. Lifelong friend Jonas Mekas saved all
        her letters, creating a rich archive that filmmaker Chuck Smith
        carefully sculpts into this fascinating portrait of a nearly forgotten
        artist. An avante-garde maverick, a rebel in a man's world, Barbara
        Rubin regains her rightful place in film history.</image:caption
