        >Over a period of six years, director James Bluemel and producer Gordon
        Wilson followed epileptic alcoholic Nigel (37) from Oxford, England, who
        managed to slip through the net of the welfare system for 66 months.
        Self-mutilation, alcohol, and childlike delusions mean Nigel is a
        vulnerable man. In the words of his social worker, "Nigel has been
        abused financially, sexually, and emotionally for years." She's
        referring to the days when, while out "in the wild," a man named Robbie
        took Nigel under his wings. He was like a father to Nigel, while at the
        same time absolutely unfit for the role of caregiver, especially because
        he couldn't keep his hands to himself.</image:caption
