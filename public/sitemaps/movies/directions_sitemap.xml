        >A road movie set in present day Bulgaria, a country remains optimistic,
        mainly because all the realists and pessimists have left. At a meeting
        with his banker, a small business owner, who drives a cab to make ends
        meet, discovers the bribe he will have to pay to get a loan has doubled.
        The ethics board that reviewed his complaint about extortion now wants
        its share of the action. At his wit's end, he shoots the banker and then
        himself. The incident sparks national debate on talk radio about how
        despair has taken over civil society. Meanwhile, six taxi drivers and
        their passengers move through the night, each in hope of finding a
        brighter way forward.</image:caption
