        >Karolina (Katarzyna Zawadzka) works in a bank, she is energetic,
        self-confident, go-getting. When the latest currency product comes into
        her hands - a loan in Swiss francs, the woman gets a great chance to
        prove herself. Having the full consent of his boss - Adam (Tomasz
        Karolak), he unscrupulously starts persuading clients to take the most
        risky and unfavorable investments. Jan (Jan Frycz) is the gray eminence
        of the Polish financiers. In his phone, he has contacts to the
        presidents of the largest banks in Poland. His cynical ideas and
        decisions affect the economy and the fate of hundreds of thousands of
        people overnight. Such as Artur (Rafał Zawierucha) - an ambitious head
        of an IT company who decides to use currency options to develop his
        business. His partner is Mateusz (Antoni Królikowski), who dreams of
        independence, his own place and the longed-for move away from his
        in-laws.</image:caption
