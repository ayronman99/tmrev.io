        >16 year-old Georg is forced to leave his home in the West, which means
        saying goodbye to his two loves; his girlfriend, and his Taekwondo team,
        something that is all-important to him. Now living in Cottbus, an
        economically depressed place where the people are not too fond of things
        like American culture and foreigners living in their country, Georg soon
        falls in with a group of angry mates. Together the group delves further
        into a nationalist way of thinking, and soon they are shaving their
        heads, and becoming a skinhead gang. "Kombat Sechzehn" features some
        impressive, proffessional looking fight sequences, as well as a
        memorable soundtrack.</image:caption
