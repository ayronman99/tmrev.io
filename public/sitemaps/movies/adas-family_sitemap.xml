        >Until her unexpected death, grandma Ada was the head of the entire
        family. But even after death, the business-like old woman does not leave
        her relatives to their fate. Ada's Ghost appears on the doorstep and
        informs that the family may lose their apartment in the near future.
        Discouraged descendants under the guidance of a Ghost grandmother must
        pay off their debts, win back their rightful inheritance, and at the
        same time learn to live independently. Otherwise, the spirit of my
        grandmother Ada never rest in peace.</image:caption
