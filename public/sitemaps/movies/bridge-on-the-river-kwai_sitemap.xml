        >During World War II, Allied POWs were forced by Japanese Soldiers to
        work on the construction of the Thailand to Burma railway which included
        the Bridge on the River Kwai. The prisoners worked under savage
        conditions and only with basic tools. Based on witness testimonies and
        photographic evidence, the documentary tries to answer the questions as
        to how this feat of engineering was built. The documentary special also
        tells of the development of America's first precision guided munition,
        the' Azon' bomb, and how it was used to destroy the
        bridge.</image:caption
