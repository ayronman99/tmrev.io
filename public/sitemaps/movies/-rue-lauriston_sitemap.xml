        >93, rue Lauriston, in the 16th arrondissement de Paris, is an address
        of bleak memory. It was indeed the headquarter of the French Gestapo,
        which was active between 1941 and 1944 and was headed by Henri Lafont
        and Pierre Loutrel, two wanted criminals. On the day of 1940 he was
        demobilized, little did well-meaning Léon Jabinet know that he would be
        associated with such disreputable characters. And yet, some time later,
        Odile Panzer, the Jewish girl he has been hiding at his parents'place,
        is arrested by the Gestapo. On this occasion Léon is offered a deal for
        her release: collaborating with the Carlingue (another name for the
        French auxiliaries of the Nazi police) and Odile will be free. Or
        else... What should he do?</image:caption
