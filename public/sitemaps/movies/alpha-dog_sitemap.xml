        >Johnny Truelove likes to see himself as tough. He's the son of an
        underworld figure and a drug dealer. Johnny also likes to get tough when
        things don't go his way. When Jake Mazursky fails to pay up for Johnny,
        things get worse for the Mazursky family, as Johnny and his 'gang'
        kidnap Jake's 15 year old brother and holds him hostage. Problem now is
        what to do with 'stolen boy?'</image:caption
