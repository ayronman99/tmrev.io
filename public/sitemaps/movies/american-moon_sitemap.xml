        >Has man really been to the moon? Itâ€™s been 50 years, and the debate
        rages on. For the firs time, a film compiles in a single piece of work,

        contrary to them. For the first time we can also analyze the Apollo
        pictures in detail, with the aid of some among the top photographers in
        the world. What was the Apollo project really? The biggest achievement
        in the history of mankind, or the biggest fakery of all times, watched
        on live television by more than half a billion people?</image:caption
