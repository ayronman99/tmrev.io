        >Over time, the people residing on Swampland began to take on new forms,
        their modified DNA altering their physiology to better suit their new
        environment. Generations passed and their original forms were forgotten;
        these humans had evolved into a new race: the Frogmen.If history (and
        genetics for that matter) shows us anything, it is that there is always
        variety.The genetic "success" of the Frogmen was also mirrored by the
        "achievements" of another group of human descent: the Cockroaches,
        otherwise known as the T-zhu Alliance. The brutal T-Hy poured out into
        the galaxy seeking new territories, resources, and the data crystals
        left by the original human explorers. The T-Hy's material driven hunger
        broke the peaceful lives of the Frogmen forcing them to take up arms in
        order to stop the T-Hy's insatiable ambitions. So began the MALO
        war.</image:caption
