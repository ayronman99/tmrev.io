        >Anthony Fonseca, nicknamed "Cymbaline", enjoys a hobby of photography
        and graffiti, which he practices together with his friend Fanny.
        Suddenly, two girls reappear in his life: Michelle, an editor of a
        magazine and social climber, and Flavia, a very rich daughter of a bored
        and spoiled father. Anthony thus finds himself having to share his life
        with three girls who are completely different from each other, but at a
        certain point he realizes that he is being followed by a fourth woman, a
        mysterious and unknown girl.</image:caption
