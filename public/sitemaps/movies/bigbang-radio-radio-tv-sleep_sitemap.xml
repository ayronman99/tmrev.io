        >The main part of this DVD is a concert film that was made during the
        tour for Radio Radio TV Sleep in January / February 2003. In addition to
        magical concert moments (both acoustic and electric), we get to meet the
        band in the tour bus, at sound check and at Youngstorget, Oslo during
        the demonstration against the war in Iraq. The film has very strong
        emotions and gives a very good insight into what it's like to experience
        this band live.</image:caption
