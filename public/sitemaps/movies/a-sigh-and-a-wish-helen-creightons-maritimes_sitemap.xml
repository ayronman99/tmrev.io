        >A Sigh and a Wish tells the story of pioneer folklorist Helen Creighton
        and of the enduring appeal of her remarkable collections of song and
        story. Creighton helped define Maritime culture as we know it. Thanks to
        her, folk songs moved out of the kitchens and the fishing boats and into
        the mainstream. Top contemporary Maritime musicians - talents like Mary
        Jane Lamond and Lennie Gallant - describe how deeply they have been
        influenced by Creighton. For 60 years, Creighton sought out ghost
        stories, superstitions and tales of buried treasure, as well as songs
        handed down from generation to generation: fishing songs, work songs,
        love songs. Timeless songs. A Sigh and a Wish is a moving tribute to the
        genius of a self-taught folklorist and to the continuing strength of the
        deep oral traditions she helped preserve. But it also raises important
        questions. Does Creighton's collection truly reflect Maritime culture,
        or is it tinged by her own upper-middle-class
        assumptions?</image:caption
