        >Comedy from Charlie Brooker starring Philomena Cunk, the witless
        commentator from Charlie Brooker's Weekly Wipe. Philomena knows
        absolutely nothing about Shakespeare, but that won't stop her attempting
        to present a groundbreaking documentary about him. Cunk will leave no
        stone unturned as she gets to the bottom of the Bard, visiting his
        birthplace, exploring the Globe, studying priceless artefacts and
        interviewing literally six different experts, including renowned actor
        Simon Russell Beale, Educating Yorkshire teacher Matthew Burton and top
        Shakespearean scholar Professor Stanley Wells. Shorter than Hamlet,
        funnier than King Lear and easier to spell than Cymbeline, Cunk On
        Shakespeare is absolutely the last word in Shakespeare
        documentaries.</image:caption
