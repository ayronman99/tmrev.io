        >Zhou Can moved to school in a small town from a big city, a place he
        didn't like, and kept thinking about going back to where he had lived.
        His grades are very excellent, so he doesn't have to worry about study
        in the new school. In terms of personality, he is always quiet, doesn't
        like to communicate with people, and his ability to make friends is
        lacking. Yu Jiao Yang is a wild and cheerful girl who has very poor
        grades in this small town. They are two people who are very different in
        every way but as the two meet and form a very close friendship, they
        stay together through every obstacle they go through.</image:caption
