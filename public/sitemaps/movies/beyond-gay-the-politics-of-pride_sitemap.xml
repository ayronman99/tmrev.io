        >Over the course of a year, film follows Vancouver Pride Society
        president Ken Coolen to various international Pride events, including
        Poland, Hungary, Russia, Sri Lanka and others where there is great
        opposition to pride parades. In North America, Pride is complicated by
        commercialization and a sense that the festivals are turning away from
        their political roots toward tourism, party promotion and entertainment.
        Christie documents the ways larger, more mainstream Pride events have
        supported the global Pride movement and how human rights components are
        being added to more established events. In the New York sequence,
        leaders organize an alternative Pride parade, the Drag March, set up to
        protest the corporatization of New York Pride. A parade in SÃ£o Paulo,
        the world's largest Pride festival, itself includes a completely empty
        float, meant to symbolize all those lost to HIV and to anti-gay
        violence.</image:caption
