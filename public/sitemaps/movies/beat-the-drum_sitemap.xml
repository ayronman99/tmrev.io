        >Young Musa is orphaned after a mysterious illness strikes his village
        in KwaZulu Natal. To help his grandmother, Musa sets out for
        Johannesburg with his father's last gift, a tribal drum, in search of
        work and his uncle. The journey confronts him with the stark realities
        of urban life, but his indomitable spirit never wavers; he returns with
        a truth and understanding his elders have failed to
        grasp.</image:caption
