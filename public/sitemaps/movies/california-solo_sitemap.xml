        >Lachlan MacAldonich is a self-described “lazy Scotsman” and former
        guitar player for a once-popular 1990s rock band. No longer famous, he
        now lives a comfortably numb existence working on an organic farm
        outside Los Angeles. He drinks himself into a stupor every night and
        retires to his shabby apartment to record his podcast, recounting the
        tragic deaths of great musicians. After a particularly heavy night of
        drowning his sorrows at a local watering hole, he is arrested for
        driving under the influence. This snag, coupled with a long-ago
        conviction for a drug offense, means Lachlan faces possible deportation.
        His only hope of remaining stateside is proving that his absence would
        cause extreme hardship for a spouse or relative – forcing him to
        confront relationships he thought were buried forever.</image:caption
