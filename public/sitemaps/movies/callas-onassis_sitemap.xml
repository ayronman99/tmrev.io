        >Maria Callas, one of the most talented opera singers of her time,
        seemed to have it all. Coming from humble origins, she always felt
        slighted by her mother's preference for her sister. She grew up in an
        unhappy environment, until her career in the operatic world took off.
        Aristotles Onassis also came from a poor Greek family. His ambition took
        him places where others dare not go and became a shipping magnate whose
        great wealth bought his entry into an international society he didn't
        ever dreamed of entering. These two powerful personalities were so much
        alike that their own passion served to destroy them.</image:caption
