        >A successful TV star during the 1960s, former "Hogan's Heroes" actor
        Bob Crane projects a wholesome family-man image, but this front masks
        his persona as a sex addict who records and photographs his many
        encounters with women, often with the help of his seedy friend, John
        Henry Carpenter. This biographical drama reveals how Crane's double life
        takes its toll on him and his family, and ultimately contributes to his
        death.</image:caption
