        >Celeste and Jesse met in high school and got married young. They laugh
        at the same jokes and finish each other’s sentences. They are forever
        linked in their friends’ minds as the perfect couple – she, a
        high-powered businesswoman and budding novelist; he, a free spirit who
        keeps things from getting boring. Their only problem is that they have

        minor setback?</image:caption
