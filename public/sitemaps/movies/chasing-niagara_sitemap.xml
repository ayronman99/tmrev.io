        >When pro kayaker Rafa Ortiz makes the decision to paddle over Niagara
        Falls, he sets in motion an incredible series of events that eventually
        takes on a life of its own. To prepare for this mission, Rafa enlists
        the help of world-renowned paddler Rush Sturges and a tight team of
        their friends. Together they go on a remarkable three-year journey from
        the rainforest rivers of Mexico to the towering waterfalls of the U.S.
        Northwest. Their journey concludes in Canada where the team plays a
        cat-and-mouse game with local police before Rafa's mission comes to a
        heart-stopping climax at the iconic Falls.</image:caption
