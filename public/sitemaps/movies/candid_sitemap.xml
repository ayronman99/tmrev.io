        >Stalking random people throughout the city, Jim records strangers to
        upload to his website as part of a voyeuristic social experiment. As he
        performs reconnaissance on his subjects, Jim meets Samantha, who snares
        him into her dark and mysterious web. It soon becomes clear that Jim and
