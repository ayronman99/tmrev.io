        >On 22 December 1997, forty-five indigenous residents of the small
        Southern Mexican village of Acteal were attending a prayer meeting in
        their village church when they were slaughtered by unknown paramilitary
        forces. They were members of the pacifist group Las Abejas (The Bees),
        who were supporters of the revolutionary Zapatistas but renounced their
        violent methods. The investigation into their deaths quickly went
        suspiciously cold. Scottish documentary maker Nick Higgins, an expert on
        Mexican culture and politics and the author of Understanding the Chiapas
        Rebellion, attains unprecedented access to the place, the people, and
        the story behind a barely-reported atrocity.</image:caption
