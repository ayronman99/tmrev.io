        >In this story about impoverished urban life, a woman named Kelly has to
        decide how much risk and sacrifice is worth the chance to get out of the
        ghetto. Stealing the 250,000 dollars that her fresh-out-of-prison
        boyfriend is hording from a bank heist, she makes a run for it, fully
        aware that if he finds her, she will be dead. Both of these people want
        a chance at a clean life, but after everything they must go through to
        get it, that life may turn out to be nothing but a dream.</image:caption
