        >Shot at Bell County Jail in Texas, Ali Siddiq: It's Bigger Than These
        Bars shares Ali's hilarious experiences of both incarceration and
        freedom. Siddiq talks with jailers and the jailed about life in lockup,
        and explains why dousing yourself in baby oil and refusing to leave your
        cell is always a bad idea. Encouraging and inspiring his convict
        audience, Ali makes hard laughs out of hard time, restoring faith in the
        power of second chances.</image:caption
