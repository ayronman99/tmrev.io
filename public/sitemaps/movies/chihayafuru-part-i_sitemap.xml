        >When Chihaya Ayase was in the 6th grade of elementary school, she met
        Arata Wataya. Arata Wataya transferred from Fukui Prefecture. Taichi
        Mashima was Chihaya Ayase's friend since they were little. Arata got
        close to Chihaya and Taichi from the card game karuta. Four years later,
        Chihaya is a high school student. Chihaya learns that Arata, who went
        back to Fukui Prefecture, doesn't play karuta anymore. Believing they
        will meet Arata again, Chihaya and Taichi starts a karuta club at their
