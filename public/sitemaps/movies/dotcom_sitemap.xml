        >A small village in Portugal, √Åguas-Altas, is being sued by a Spanish
        multinational corporation because the village hosts a website that uses
        the same name as an international brand of mineral water. A judicial
        battle for website begins, that quickly turned in to a media circus.

        internet is, are forced defend their website and their villages
        honour.</image:caption
