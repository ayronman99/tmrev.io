        >Mercedes is a private music teacher who dreams of the return of her
        husband Ramiro, who has not stopped writing and sending her a check
        every month. Mercedes lives with her children: the eldest, Sebastián, is
        a cadet who, after graduating after the coup d'état on March 10, becomes
        a censor of the magazine Carteles; Alicia studies in the university and
        her aspiration is to look for in the United States the father who left
        them when they were very young; Sebastián is the one who tries to keep
        the family together and Javier, the youngest, follows in the footsteps
        of the mother in music and is a flutist, his greatest aspiration is to
        play in the América orchestra where Enrique Jorrín is taking the first
        steps that will lead him to the Chachachá as a danceable
        rhythm.</image:caption
