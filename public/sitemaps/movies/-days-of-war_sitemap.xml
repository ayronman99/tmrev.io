        >An American journalist and his cameraman are caught in the combat zone
        during the first Russian airstrikes against Georgia. Rescuing Tatia, a
        young Georgian schoolteacher separated from her family during the
        attack, the two reporters agree to help reunite her with her family in
        exchange for serving as their interpreter. As the three attempt to
        escape to safety, they witness--and document--the devastation from the
        full-scale crossfire and cold-blooded murder of innocent
        civilians.</image:caption
