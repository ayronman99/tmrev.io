        >Filmed at their Royal Albert Hall debut gig in September 2000, Bond
        Live is a slick showcase for four classically trained, ex-session
        musicians and their fusion of string quartet and rock music. Whatever
        the hype (four beautiful women wearing scanty tops and dancing with
        violins while backed by a five-piece rock combo and a small, rarely seen
        string section), it has nothing to do with making classical music cool
        and everything to do with sex. In "Duel," first and second violins
        Haylie Ecker and Eos trade licks "guitar-hero" style, and most of the
        tracks are new instrumentals written for the album Born, though "The
        1812" does manage to reduce Tchaikovsky's overture to a five-minute
        dance number. With rock-show lighting, synthesizers, dance beats, and a
        finale involving the "James Bond Theme" followed by a Rio-style fiesta
        for the closing "Victory--Carnival Mix," this is camp, melodramatic,
        sexy fun.</image:caption
