        >In 1965, Takeshi Kitano drops out of a university and enters the
        Asakusa France Za, which is a performance theater. He becomes an
        apprentice to Senzaburo Fukami, who is a legendary entertainer.
        Senzaburo Fukami demands that Takeshi Kitano keep the mindset of an
        entertainer, not only on stage, but also in his daily life. Takeshi
        Kitano cultivates his dream of becoming an entertainer with other
        apprentices. Due to the popularity of TV, people attend the theater less
        and less, but Takeshi Kitano spends his youthful days with Senzaburo
        Fukami and other apprentices who are full of talent and unique
        personalities.</image:caption
