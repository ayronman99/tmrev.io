        >The atrocities Sok Chea witnessed as a child during the rule of Pol Pot
        continue to haunt to this day, nearly thirty years later. So she is
        shocked when she suddenly comes across the man who was in charge of her
        prison and whom she holds responsible for murdering most of her family.
        Once again he holds a prominent position, this time as Deacon of Death
        or leader of cremation ceremonies. She decides to collect evidence
        against him. He must stand trial. But can she succeed in a country still
        ruled by fear. Besides which, Cambodians believe in karma and
        forgiveness. Wrongdoers are punished after their death anyway and will
        suffer for many lives to come. Sok Chea'ss quest leads her to a
        confrontation with Karoby, in the same pagoda where the atrocities
        occurred.</image:caption
