        >Filmed by 12 HD cameras and recorded by a top mobile studio, the show
        offers one of the most magical performances of the NOW What?! tour.
        Every member of the band is in fantastic form, the band being strong
        from a full tour together, and the performance seems to be driving the
        band through the song like if audience and band were suspended in
        time.</image:caption
