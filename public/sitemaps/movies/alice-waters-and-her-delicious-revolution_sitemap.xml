        >Every great cook secretly believes in the power of food. Alice Waters
        just believes this more than anybody else. She is certain that we are
        what we eat, and she has made it her mission in life to make sure that
        people eat beautifully. Waters is creating a food revolution, even if
        she has to do it one meal at a time.</image:caption
