        >After taking a break for the summer before their senior year, Ryan and
        Jess rekindle their relationship, and find out that Jess is pregnant
        with twins. When Ryan's mother demands a paternity test, they find out
        that Ryan is only the father of one baby... The other father is Ryan's
        best friend Bryce, who Ryan discovers date raped Jess at a party over
        the summer. With college recruiters and an overbearing father looming
        over Bryce's head, he will stop at nothing to make sure that he clears
        his name--even if it means getting rid of Jess and her babies! Morgan
