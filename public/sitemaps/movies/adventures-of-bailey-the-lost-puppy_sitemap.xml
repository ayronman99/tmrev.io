        >Bailey, an adorable Golden Retriever puppy, is moving! On the road trip
        to their new home, his family makes a stop and mistakenly leaves Bailey
        behind. This mischievous and playful pup sets out to find his family and
        stumbles across "Sharkarosa," an exotic wildlife ranch. At the ranch,
        Bailey meets and is befriended by an assortment of animals, including
        kangaroos, camels, a bearcat, a baby tiger, and "Puck," the sheepdog
        entrusted with running "Sharkarosa." Will Bailey ever see his family
        again? Or will he be left to work at the ranch until the "Cows Come
        Home?"</image:caption
