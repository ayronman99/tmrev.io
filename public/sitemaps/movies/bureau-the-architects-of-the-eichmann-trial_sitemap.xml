        >Bureau 06 tells the dramatic story of the team of Israeli police
        investigators that researched and prepared the charges brought by the
        Jewish people against Adolf Eichmann. The charges, when collated and
        then heard in court 50 years ago, told the story of the Jewish Holocaust
        to the entire world in a way that it had not been told before. This
        changed the collective Israeli consciousness forever. Bureau 06 tells
        the personal stories of this team of investigators; their hardships,
        their confessions and the emotional turmoil they experienced, together
        and alone. Among these is the story of Avner Less, Adolf Eichmannâ€™s
        interrogator who left Israel after the trial and took back his German
        identity card.</image:caption
