        >Claude Goretta directed “L'invitation” in 1973. For filmmaker Lionel
        Baier, born in 1975, it is like a “travelling companion”, to adapt Serge
        Daney’s expression. He feels it is definitive proof that a Swiss can be
        deeply Chekhovian. The young filmmaker goes to Geneva to ask his elder
        how he achieved the whoosh of water effect in the film, why attention to
        detail matters so much, and how to film great actors such as François
        Simon. This encounter with Claude Goretta – but also with Isabelle
        Huppert, Nathalie Baye, Michel Robin and Frédérique Meininger – leads
        one of the greatest of Swiss filmmakers to open up about his
        work.</image:caption
