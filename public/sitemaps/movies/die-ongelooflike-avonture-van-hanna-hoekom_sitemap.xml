        >Based on the favourite Afrikaans children's novel, Hanna is 14 going on
        15 and is part of a rather unconventional family. They go on holiday to
        the Cederberg for a family reunion, which leads to plenty of surprises
        and reconciliation. Hanna is an intelligent and imaginative young girl
        who's earned herself the nickname "Hoekom," because she's forever
        questioning things. When her eccentric mother decides that the family –
        including her gay biological dad, actor stepfather, detestable
        half-brother and two stepbrothers – should spend their winter holiday in
        a remote house on a mountain, they end up stranded with nowhere to go
        and no-one to turn to except each other.</image:caption
