        >Brothers-in-law, Eduardo and Sabonis, married to sisters Cuca and Peque
        Ribeiro, have made a real mess of one of their business ventures and are
        in need of money, a lot of money. It will be Sabonis who, in one of his
        uncontrollable fits of rage, comes up with a plan to fix all their
        problems in one go: kidnap Modesto, brother-in-law to Alicia Zamora, the
        businesswoman who screwed them over. There’s just one problem: Alicia
        has no intention of paying even a penny to get her brother-in-law back.
        In the end, it will be Modesto himself who comes up with a new plan to
        help Eduardo and Sabonis get the money they need to save the family wine
        business. What they don’t know is that police officer Mati, the
        Ribeiro’s middle sister, is on to their little plan. Eduardo, Sabonis
        and Modesto have everything to lose, but as Sabonis would say, what
        could go wrong?</image:caption
