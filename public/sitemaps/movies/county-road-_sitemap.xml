        >This film is Taiwan’s first protest music documentary, examining Jiao
        Gong Band 交工樂隊. Jiao Gong Band initially received attention from
        their efforts opposing the Meinong Dam project. After a brief pause in
        the Dam issue, Jiao Gong began following farm and farming issues, with
        their musical style quickly gaining increased popularity. This film
        discusses the uneasy situation faced by Taiwan’s farm youth. The youth
        that sets out to the city seeking to develop themselves carry feelings
        of homesickness from leaving their farm and land; on returning to their
        hometown after the bubble economy, they continue to push the elder
        generation to leave the village. Aside from this, because of their
        difficult social status, farm youth can often only search for Southeast
        Asian “foreign brides” when seeking marriage. Within the film, new
        residents (新住民) discuss their feelings and mindset in moving to
        Taiwan and collaborate with Jiao Gong throughout the album’s recording
        process.</image:caption
