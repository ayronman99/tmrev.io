        >After World War Two, successive governments sold off and encouraged the
        clearing of less viable areas for agriculture. During the 1960s a
        million acres a year were opened up. Much of the land was unsuitable for
        farming yet the new landholders were obliged to bulldoze and burn the
        native bush or risk losing their allocation. Most were eager to do so
        and pressured the government to release even more land. The long-term
        consequences have been devastating, with industrial farming and salinity
        turning most of this priceless natural heritage into a biological
        desert.</image:caption
