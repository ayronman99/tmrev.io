        >In 1987 Korea, under an oppressive military regime, a college student
        gets killed during a police interrogation involving torture. Government
        of officials are quick to cover up the death and order the body to be
        cremated. A prosecutor who is supposed to sign the cremation release,
        raises questions about a 21-year-old kid dying of a heart attack, and he
        begins looking into the case for truth. Despite a systematic attempt to
        silence everyone involved in the case, the truth gets out, causing an
        eruption of public outrage.</image:caption
