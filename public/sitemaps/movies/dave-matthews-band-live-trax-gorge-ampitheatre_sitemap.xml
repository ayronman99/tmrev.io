        >Live Trax Vol. 44: 9.4.16 The Gorge Amphitheatre, George, WA With the
        spectacular river gorge as the backdrop, Dave Matthews Band took their
        final bow of the 2016 tour at the Gorge Amphitheatre before heading into
        an extended hiatus. The weekend, which has been affectionately dubbed
        “Labor Dave Weekend,” was full of incredible energy and solid
        performances that covered the breadth of the band’s catalogue. This show
        from September 4th kicked off with “The Stone,” complete with an
        audience sing-along, and ended with a two-song encore of “Pig” and “Stay
        (Wasting Time).” Special guests included Carlos Malta on woodwinds on
        “Say Goodbye,” “The Maker,” and “Typical Situation,” while touring crew
        member Joe Lawlor played guitar on a fiery performance of “Rhyme &
        Reason.”</image:caption
