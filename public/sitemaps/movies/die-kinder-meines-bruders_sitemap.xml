        >Eric leads a carefree life in Berlin. He loves his girlfriend Verena,
        but family, attachment and responsibility are foreign words for him.
        When he learns of the death of his brother, who lived as a dairy farmer
        in Saxony-Anhalt, Eric wants to wind up the insolvent farm as quickly as
        possible and deport Christoph's children to foster parents. When he
        realizes that the price dumping of the milk cartels drove his brother to
        his death he tells the big dairies to fight.</image:caption
