        >Seok-ho, a self-styled playboy with a beautiful wife, is fooling around
        with Ji-yeon, a voluptuous photographer, but pines for Chae-young, a
        college student who appears to be the most virtuous girl in all of
        Korea. But it turns out that Chae-young, who frustrates her suitor at
        every turn, is not so chaste after all. The plot thickens as Seok-ho's
        best friend Young-su, outwardly awkward and shy, sets his sights on
        Ji-yeon, not realizing that she is already involved with his best
        buddy.</image:caption
