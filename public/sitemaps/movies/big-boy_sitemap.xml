        >Po is a country young guy who dreams to become a cool B-Boy dancer to
        get attention from the girl he has a crush on. When Po hears the news of
        his grandfather Poon is in the hospital in Bangkok, he uses this news as
        an advantage to move to Bangkok, excusing his parents that he really
        wants to look after his grandfather. But grandfather Poon is perfectly a
        young at heart, playboy type and diehard who always has a quarrel with
        Po. Soon, their broken relationship slowly recovered when Po starts to
        pursue his B-Boy dream and grandfather Poon is his sole
        companion.</image:caption
