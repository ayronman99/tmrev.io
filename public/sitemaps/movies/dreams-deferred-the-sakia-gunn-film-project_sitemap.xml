        >In 2003, Sakia Gunn was fatally stabbed in a gay hate crime in Newark,
        New Jersey. She was fifteen years old and called herself an Aggressive,
        an homosexual woman of color who dresses in masculine attire but does
        not necessarily identify as either lesbian or female-to-male
        transgender. Dreams Deferred depicts the homophobia that caused her
        untimely death and questions the lack of national media coverage of the
        murder of a Black Gay youth.</image:caption
