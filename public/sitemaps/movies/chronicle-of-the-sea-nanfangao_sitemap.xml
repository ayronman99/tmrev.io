        >Nan-Fang-Ao, a village in northeast Taiwan, once thrived on its big-net
        fishing industry. Now migrant workers from the Philippines and China
        vigorously live and work with the locals on one of the few remaining
        fishing boats. As we observe their life at sea, where the air is abuzz
        with different languages and gestures, thoughts of home drift among
        those who have come to provide for their families. There is the captain
        who talks about the old days, the woman who sent her husband off to sea
        and runs a shop in the village, and the laborers from foreign countries
        who buy gifts for their families at the market. With a fresh look, the
        film depicts people living on the unchanging stage of the oceanâ€™s vast
        wilderness.</image:caption
