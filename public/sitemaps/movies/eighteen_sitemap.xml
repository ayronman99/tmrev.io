        >Eighteen year-old Tae-hoon and Mi-jung have been going out for 100
        days. During winter break they decide to take a trip to the beach to
        celebrate their anniversary. When they are back home after a few days,
        they have to confront a harsh situation – Mi-jung’s parents don’t allow
        them to see each other until they become college students. Tae-hoon
        struggles to keep their love and wanders around Mi-jung but she is
        eventually changed and avoids him as her parents wish. Winter turns to
        spring, and Tae-hoon and Mi-jung both turn nineteen.</image:caption
