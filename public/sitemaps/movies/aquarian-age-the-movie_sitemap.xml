        >Mayumi, the peaceful daughter of an E.G.O. leader, has never been able
        to come to terms with her faction's mission or her psychic abilities.
        Everything changes when, in the middle of a horrific attack on Earth, a
        mysterious boy named Hokuto appears. Mayumi is suddenly infused with a
        power she's never felt before. Hokuto convinces a new generation of
        E.G.O., ARAYASHIKI, WIZ-DOM, and DARKLORE members that the world is in
        danger. The POLESTAR EMPIRE, led by the ambitious Emperor, seeks to
        conquer the universe by resurrecting dead warriors. Four young women
        will discover their own personal strengths to face the ultimate evil in
        the Aquarian Age, a chaotic period rife with war.</image:caption
