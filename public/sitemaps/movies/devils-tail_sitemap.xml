        >The story begins with a prayer. And it ends with a prayer. The first
        one is a prayer to God. The second - to the Devil. Between the two
        prayers is Pavel - a talented, chaotic and irresponsible musician and
        composer. Everything is wonderful until the day he realizes he has lost
        the girl he loves. In order to win her love back, Pavel is ready to do
        anything - even pray to the Devil. When one prays to God, one relies on
        His mercy. When one prays to the Devil, this is a deal. You can ask for
        whatever you want and you have to offer something in exchange. And there
        is only one pawn in the Devil's game...</image:caption
