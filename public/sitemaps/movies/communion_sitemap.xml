        >When adults are ineffectual, children have to grow up quickly. Ola is
        14 and she takes care of her dysfunctional father, autistic brother and
        a mother who lives apart from them and is mainly heard the phone. Most
        of all she wants to reunite a family that simply doesn’t work — like a
        defective TV set. She lives in the hope of bringing her mother back
        home. Her 13 year old brother Nikodem’s Holy Communion is a pretext for
        the family to meet up. Ola is entirely responsible for preparing the
        perfect family celebration. “Communion” reveals the beauty of the
        rejected, the strength of the weak and the need for change when change
        seems impossible. This crash course in growing up teaches us that
        failure is not final. Especially when love is in
        question.</image:caption
