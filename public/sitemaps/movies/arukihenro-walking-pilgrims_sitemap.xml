        >For a great number of people the main motive for undertaking a
        pilgrimage consists in the journey itself - wandering along a path
        leading away from the familiar place and at the same time leading
        towards oneself. This constant quest and the continuous enhancement of
        the daily experience, in whatsoever form, seem to be a central need of
        each human being. The road movie and documentary film "Arukihenro"
        focuses on this need in relation to the lives of today's Japanese
        wandering pilgrims. It shows their motives, aims and desires on a very
        personal level along the 88 Temples' Pilgrimage that circles the
        Japanese island of Shikoku. Directed by anthropologist Tommi Mendel, the
        film was shown at festivals throughout 2007 in France, Estonia, Norway,
        UK, Brazil, Serbia and Slovenia.</image:caption
