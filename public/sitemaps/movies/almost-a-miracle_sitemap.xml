        >High school boy Machida is a loner who is not particularly good at his
        studies or extracurricular activities. He does seem to have his heart in
        the right place however. When he is injured at school instead of the
        school nurse at the infirmary a school-mate tends to him. He develops a
        crush for her and soon enough the feelings are returned.</image:caption
