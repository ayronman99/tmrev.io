        >Professional killer Ken (Hirofumi Arai) is trying to break away from
        the yakuza. Taking up work at a local motorcycle shop, he forges a new
        life under the motherly eye of Yoko (Jun Fubuki), an older woman who
        owns the shop. However, Ken's dark past isn't letting him go that
        easily. Akira (Jun Murakami), Ken's ruthless mentor and himself an
        assassin, has been coming around and pressuring Ken to return to the
        family. Together with orphaned teenager Tsuyoshi (Niinobu Ryomei), Ken
        decides to take to the road and settle matters in the only way he knows
        - by the trigger of his gun. Featuring music by Snake on the Beach, a
        solo project of legendary singer and guitarist Yusuke Chiba, A Road
        Stained Crimson takes viewers down the high-octane expressway of bikes,
        guns and rock 'n' roll.</image:caption
