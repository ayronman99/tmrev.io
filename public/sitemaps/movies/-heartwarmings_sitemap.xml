        >Sequel to 77 Heartbreaks, 77 Heartwarmings, sees the return of Charlene
        Choi as Eva, and Chau Pak-ho as her ex-boyfriend Adam. Although it has
        been a year since their relationship ended, Adam is still very fond of
        Eva and hopes to win her back. He comes across an app that teaches him
        what to do to reignite the passion in Eva. While Adam tries the tips
        mentioned in the app and gradually bridges the gap between them, Eva
        meets Thai star Marvel (Mario Maurer), who also vies for Evaâ€™s
        love.</image:caption
