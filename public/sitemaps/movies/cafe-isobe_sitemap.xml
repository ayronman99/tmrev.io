        >Sakiko is a typical teenager in many ways. She hates her divorced
        father, who chases after every skirt he sees. She does not know, if she
        will ever be loved by the other sex. When her dad suddenly inherits a
        lot of money and becomes really lazy, she hates him even more. He
        finally decides to start his own cafe, where Sakiko, of course has to
        help. From this moment, strange customers and good-looking waitresses
        form the center of tension between father and daughter.</image:caption
