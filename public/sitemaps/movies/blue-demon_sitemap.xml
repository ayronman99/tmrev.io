        >Shun is a transfer student who can't seem to adjust to his new class
        and falls into mild depression. However, one day he meets some fellow
        students by chance in front of a creepy Western-style mansion called the
        "Jailhouse" which is rumored to be home to a hideous blue monster. Soon,
        the group of six students, led by Shun and Anna, become trapped inside
        and desperately attempt to escape before the monster finds
        them.</image:caption
