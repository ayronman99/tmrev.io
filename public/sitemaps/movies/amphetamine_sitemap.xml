        >Openly gay banker Daniel debates whether to return to Australia or stay
        in Hong Kong when he meets Kafka, a straight swimming instructor. The
        young men fall in love, believing that their love can bridge anything,
        despite their difference in sexuality and Kafka's increasing drug use.
        Daniel does not regret his love for Kafka, who tries to love him back
        against his nature. But a flashback memory from Kafka's past makes it
        difficult for their relationship to work.</image:caption
