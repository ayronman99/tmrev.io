        >After André Levesque missionnaire, Oksana Karpovych is back at the RIDM
        with her first feature, which she filmed in her native country, Ukraine.
        To take the pulse of the country, the filmmaker adopts one of
        documentary cinema’s most prolific sub-genres: the train film. Filmed
        entirely in the old, run-down, overcrowded passenger trains used by
        ordinary Ukrainians, the film captures conversations, observes the
        landscape, and accompanies several protagonists on their journey; they
        open our eyes to popular preoccupations in a country that seems
        perpetually anchored in its highly visible Soviet legacy. A fine lesson
        in listening and humanity.</image:caption
