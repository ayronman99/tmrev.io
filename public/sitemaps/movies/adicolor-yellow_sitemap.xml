        >Yellow or Adicolor Yellow is a 2006 futuristic short film by director
        Neill Blomkamp, written by Terri Tatchell and Blomkamp. It was produced
        at the request of sportswear maker Adidas as a part of its "Adicolor"
        viral ads campaign, in which advertising agency Idealogue gathered seven
        directors, assigning a different color to each of them, and asked them
        to produce a feature based on their emotional and creative response to
        the given color, later to be distributed in the form of podcasts. The
        four-minute film, shot by Trent Opaloch in Blomkamp's usual handheld
        camera mockumentary style, deals with an Israeli robotic globe-trotter
        gone rogue.</image:caption
