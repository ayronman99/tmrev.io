        >Marie lives alone with her 16 year old son. She struggles to get by
        with this teenager who gets deeper and deeper in violence and juvenile
        delinquency. Speaking sentimentally, things are not going better: the
        relationship with her lover has come to an end. It may seems depressing,
        but Marie doesnâ€™t give up, even if love seems to be an inaccessible
        dream. But love, there is. We can feel the affection of this mother for
        her troublesome child, thanks to Mathilde Seigner, who gives an
        astonishing performance. A subtle directing, a strong and captivating
        story, in short: a must see.</image:caption
