        >David's turning 50 and having a Mid-life Crisis! He isn't sure his
        "perfect husband" loves him, and if he's chosen the right career. Aging
        is something he never thought about, but now he is faced with making the
        rest of his life count and hopes his close friends can help. Realizing
        that he may only have about 35 years left, he must figure out his life
        to ensure happiness and fulfillment. Fate changes everything when he
        meets a 15-year younger man who shows him that age does not matter, and
        that maybe his future happiness is right in front of him.</image:caption
