        >This is a recording of a live performance at Yokohama Arena from ASIAN
        KUNG-FU GENERATION's first arena tour held from the fall of 2006 to
        2007. For the band, who had always toured mainly at live houses,
        performing at a venue with a capacity of over 10,000 was a tremendous
        challenge, but they cleared this hurdle in an ideal way. The band's
        all-standing setup, the band's sound that created a bigger groove, and
        the audience's willingness to respond to the band's new challenge all
        came together to create a performance that is vividly conveyed in this
        album. This is a rare moment in which the band, who have always focused
        on the theme of "connection," demonstrate their full potential as a live
        band. The rehearsal documentary is also a must-see, offering a glimpse
        of the trials and errors of their first arena tour.</image:caption
