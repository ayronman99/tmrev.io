        >It's been seven years since the Wyoming Indian High School Chiefs have
        won a state championship in basketball. For most schools, this is a
        rather unremarkable statistic. But for the inhabitants of the Wind River
        Indian Reservation, who have experienced a century and a half of
        injustice, basketball is a form of empowerment, self-expression, and
        access to the world outside "the Rez." By using basketball as a vehicle,
        CHIEFS explores what it means to grow up Native American at the turn of
        the 21st century.</image:caption
