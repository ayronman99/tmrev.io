        >Kyle and Sarah are starting a life together in a renovated house, the
        same property where the original house burned down with its owner
        vanished a decade earlier. Despite rumors and warnings from others, the
        couple follows through with their move, only to encounter bizarre
        occurrences within the first night in their new home. When one of their
        friends soon disappears, Kyle and Sarah begin to suspect that they're
        the new targets of a cat-and-mouse game.</image:caption
