        >"AWAKENING" is a short film about an elderly woman (Louise Katchia) who
        hopes to restore her assimilated grandson's connection to their culture.
        Nathan (Solomon Trimble) is unwillingly sent to see a Shaman (Foster
        Kalama) in the cold backwoods of the Warm Springs Indian reservation.
        Immediately placed into a ceremony circle, Nathan is put into a trance
        on a spiritual quest to face his inner Native American as his modern
        self. Facing the unknown, Nathan overcomes his fear in an ultimate test
        of survival, fighting a violent cultural force within. Ultimately
        defeating the unknown, he becomes the inner Native American and restores
        his connection to his culture and faith.</image:caption
