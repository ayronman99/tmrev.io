        >29-year-old Eban has retreated home to his parent's house in Seaside
        Oregon after the dissolution of his teaching job in Seattle. There he
        courts 15-year-old Charlie and eventually the two start a sexual
        relationship. As the age of consent in Oregon is 18 years and given the
        age difference, the adults in this drama take a dim view of this
        development.</image:caption
