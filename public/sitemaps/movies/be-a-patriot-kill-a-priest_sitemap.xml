        >The war in El Salvador was the most cruel and bloody Latin America has
        ever seen. During that time of turmoil Latin American bishops created
        the famous preferential option for the poor, demanding justice, food and
        education in the name of the gospel. Using interviews and old footage,
        the film follows the civil war and the role of the Church in it. In
        1977, after the murder of Father Rutilio Grande, the Archbishop Oscar
        Romero took a strong anti government position, broadcasting sermons over
        Radio Luz demanding that the government stop the repression. He could
        not understand why he was thought to be a follower of Karl Marx, when he
        knew "he followed only Jesus Christ." An inspiring film about people of
        faith who stood up against injustice.</image:caption
