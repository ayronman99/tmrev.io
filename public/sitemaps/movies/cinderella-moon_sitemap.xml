        >Long ago, in a majestic Kingdom in China, events on Earth are reflected
        in Heaven and the sun and moon keep each other in balance. Trouble brews
        when the mistreatment of girls results in a moon that stubbornly refuses
        to move in the sky. Soon, the sun threatens to lose balance and fall
        from the heavens, destroying the Earth. The King knows that in order to
        restore balance in Heaven, he must first fix an imbalance between boys
        and girls on Earth. But how? One day, an oppressed orphan named Mei Mei
        disobeys her scheming stepmother and instead fulfills her destiny by
        attending the Full Moon Dance. It is there, wearing the magic slippers
        that her mother gave her before she died, she finally determines her
        fate â€¦ and the fate of her threatened world.</image:caption
