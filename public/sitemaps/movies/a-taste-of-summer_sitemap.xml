        >Gabby Ferrar moves to the town of Bright Shore, Massachusetts to open a
        restaurant after a stint as a sous chef in New York. Upon arrival, she
        encounters Caleb Delaney, a single father who runs his own restaurant
        and coaches the girlsâ€™ softball team. Both restaurants will compete in
        the Taste of Summer Food Festival hosted in Bright Shore. During the
        course of the summer, Gabby finds joy in running her own restaurant as
        she rediscovers her passion and gets to know Caleb.</image:caption
