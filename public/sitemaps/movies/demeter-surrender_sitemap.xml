        >Set in a broken future world, this short film allows a peek into the
        life of Demeter - a character described as tough, brilliant and
        completely psychotic. However, perception is everything - nothing is
        ever as it seems. Demeter must come to terms with people from her past,
        including her one-time mentor Nalos and her former partner,
        Daphene.</image:caption
