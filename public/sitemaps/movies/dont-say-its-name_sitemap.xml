        >After environmental activist Kharis Redwater is called back to the
        living world by her mother Mary Lynn after a questionable “accident”
        that cost Kharis her life, an ancient spirit is reborn outside of a
        small northern town out of revenge for the loss of her daughter’s life.
        Kharis returns as a Wheetago, a ferocious creature that only gets
        hungrier the more it eats. Can an ex-military Park Ranger, Stacy Cole,
        and Police Officer, Betty Stonechild, call back their traditional
        teachings to stop Kharis before she continues to feed on all who get in
        her way?</image:caption
