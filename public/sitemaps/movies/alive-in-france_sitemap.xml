        >Abel Ferrara headlines a film retrospective and a series of concerts in
        France dedicated to songs and music from his films. Preparations with
        his family and friends will form the material of this self portrait,
        showing another side of the director of legendary films BAD LIEUTENANT,
        THE KING OF NEW YORK and THE ADDICTION. Ferrara is joined on stage by
        past collaborators, including composer Joe Delia, actor-singer Paul Hipp
        and his wife actress Cristina Chiriac for concerts at the Metronum in
        Toulouse and the Salo Club in Paris in October 2016.</image:caption
