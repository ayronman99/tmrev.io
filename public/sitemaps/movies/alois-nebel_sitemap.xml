        >A train dispatcher encounters a mute stranger who appears out of
        nowhere, and finds himself mysteriously involved with a murder in
        Poland. The end of the eighties in the twentieth century. Alois Nebel
        works as a dis­patcher at the small railway station in Bílý Potok, a
        remote village on the Czech–Polish border. He's a loner, who prefers old
        timetables to people, and he finds the loneliness of the station
        tranquil – except when the fog rolls in. Then he hallucinates, sees
        trains from the last hundred years pass through the station. They bring
        ghosts and shadows from the dark past of Central Eu­rope. Alois can’t
        get rid of these nightmares and eventually ends up in sanatorium. In the
        sanatorium, he gets to know The Mute, a man carrying an old photograph
        who was arrested by the police after crossing the border. No one knows
        why he came to Bílý Potok or who he’s looking for, but it is his past
        that propels Alois on his journey…</image:caption
