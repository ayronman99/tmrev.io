        >Creature Feature is five interwoven tales of terror that occur one
        foggy Halloween night in Georgia. A babysitter learns a new appreciation
        for fine art and hard lesson about the consequences of being
        irresponsible...and naughty!; a group of college kids stumble on the
        mother of all Scarecrows; two teenagers are forced to steal from the
        wrong cantankerous old hermit who has been known to occasionally howl at
        the moon; a murdered father comes back for vengeance against his
        gold-digging wife and traitorous children; and all of this Halloween fun
        is made possible by a London Gentleman known as..."Jack"</image:caption
