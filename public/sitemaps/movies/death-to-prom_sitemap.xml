        >Two best friends make the best of going to high school by dreaming up
        fashion magazine photo shoots, and bribing their siblings to model for
        them.  René indulges all his fantasies and loves designing clothes.
        Frankie lives for her camera and punk rock. They both fall for Sasha,
        the shy soccer player with a soft spot for poems by Pushkin. When the
        three of them are caught between competing invitations to prom, their
        high-fashion drama could destroy their friendships along with the entire
        prom.</image:caption
