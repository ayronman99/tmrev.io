        >Bittoo takes pride in calling himself a "Sexy Video Shooter". He is the
        star of all wedding celebrations of Anandpur Sahib, a small town in
        Punjab. Bittoo believes in spreading happiness through the beautiful
        moments he captures, moments which you can rewind and keep watching for
        years and smile looking at them thus making them heartfelt experiences
        which last forever. He falls in love with an educated and strong-headed
        girl who makes him realize the importance of financial stability and
        monetary gains in order to gain respect and recognition. Smitten in love
        and bitten by the one he loves, the smart and righteous cameraman is
        lured to take a shortcut in order to earn a quick buck and get his life
        back on track. What follows is a madcap ride.</image:caption
