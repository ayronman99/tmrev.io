        >Cross Dreamers is the life story of 4 men who practice cross-dressing
        in Argentina. From an early age they had the need to transit the
        feminine. With the clothes, the makeup, the heels and the construction
        of a feminine identity, "Cross" seek to feel like women for a short time
        of their lives. However these 50 to 60 year old men had to repress this
        desire throughout their lives because they felt like monsters and hid it
        from their wives and children.</image:caption
