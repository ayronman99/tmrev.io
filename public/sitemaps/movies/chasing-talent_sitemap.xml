        >Mark (Casper Crump) and Laura (Mille Lehfeldt) are lovers. He is a
        singer in a failed boyband. She is getting tired of playing second
        fiddle to the relationship. But one day Laura is measured by the talent
        seeker Aslan, and it turns out that she is unbelievably talented. Laura
        becomes confident and successful. At the same time, Mark’s career is
        going downhill. Mark discovers that talent can not only be measured but
        also stolen by Aslan’s machine. In the name of love Mark sucks all of
        the talent out of his unsuspecting girlfriend and shoots for the stars –
        with massive consequences at home.</image:caption
