        >This fascinating narrative is based in part on 2 years of research,
        interviews, newly unearthed footage and photos, and the writings of
        Davis and Obama himself. Dreams from My Real Father weaves together the
        proven facts with reasoned logic and speculation in an attempt to
        fill-in the obvious gaps in Obama's history. Is this the story Barack
        Obama should have told, revealing his true agenda for "fundamentally
        transforming America?" Director Joel Gilbert concludes, "To understand
        Obama’s plans for America, the question is ’Who is the real
        father?’"</image:caption
