        >It's a movie for everyone whose life has been thrown off-course, out of
        whack, or simply not turned out the way they planned it. In other words,
        it's a movie for everyone, period. Set in suburban Long Island in the
        summer of 2002, with the psychic wounds of 9/11 still fresh, A Little
        Help is a story that takes a comic, searching and profoundly empathetic
        look at a few pivotal months in the life of dental hygienist Laura
        Pehlke (Jenna Fischer)-an ordinary woman whose life suddenly flies off
        the rails-and her heroic efforts to re-establish a sense of security and
        normalcy for herself and her son.</image:caption
