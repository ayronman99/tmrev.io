        >A whole village seems to hide behind a dark secret. At first glance,
        many abandoned and barricaded houses give the impression that life was
        once thriving in this small little town. A young reporter, Mara, along
        with her cameraman Maik, decide to visit Alt Manheim with the sole
        mission of finding some answers to the mysteries of what is happening in
        this small, once inviting town. Why are the inhabitants leaving? They
        encounter a few remaining residents who are willing to share with them
        some incredible and unbelievable stories. However, strange things begin
        to happen and Mara and Maik soon realize they have stumbled upon
        something bigger than they expected.</image:caption
