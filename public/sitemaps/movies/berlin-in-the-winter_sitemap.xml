        >The film is one of my recently series work, "Re-interpretation for the
        private films" which has been cited from old home movies. A Japanese
        diplomat, Mr.A.O. started for his assignment to Berlin since 1929. He
        was also the person fascinated by filmmaking. Of course, generally said
        his films were just the "Home Movie", however when we saw his films
        carefully, we could be found out the sensibility of other filmmakers in
        20s, just like Ruttmann, Vertov or so. I'd like to observe the lost
        films.</image:caption
