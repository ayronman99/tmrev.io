        >Archie has made a discovery that will change the world forever. A toy
        radio. Archie's brother Billy, is deaf. So, Archie duct tapes the radio
        to his head, to help him explore a world full of sound. Sophie is
        Archie's girlfriend. Archie thinks he is in love with Sophie, but Sophie
        is not sure they know what love is. They spend their time waxing each
        other's noses, deciding if getting slapped is worse than getting spit
        on, and arguing about anything that's not worth arguing about. Then one
        day, Archie decides to steal Billy fare and square from their repressive
        sister. Sophie decides to go along for the ride. The adventure that
        follows will force them to seriously consider: Do relationships rely on
        riding couches through automatic car washes? Is a toy radio really the
        cure to deafness? Is it legal to throw dead animals in dumpsters?
        Finding the answers to these important questions makes Archie, Sophie
        and Billy examine their relationships in ways they never thought
        possible.</image:caption
