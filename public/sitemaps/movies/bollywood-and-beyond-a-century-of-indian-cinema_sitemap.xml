        >Indian cinema has the largest audience of any art form on the planet.
        With a population of over a billion, India has recently enjoyed an
        economic boom and its movie stars are treated like deities. Today their
        fame stretches across the diaspora, in what has become a truly global
        industry. As Indian cinema celebrates its centenary, Sanjeev Bhaskar
        travels across the subcontinent to get under the skin of the Indian
        movie business as never before. From young hopefuls in the slums of
        Mumbai to superstars like Kareena Kapoor and Aamir Khan, he meets the
        stars of the silver screen and the people behind the scenes - legendary
        producers, directors, musicians and choreographers - exploring the
        stories behind some of the greatest films ever made.</image:caption
