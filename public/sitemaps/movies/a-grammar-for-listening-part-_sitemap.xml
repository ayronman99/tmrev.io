        >In part 3, Fowler furthers his on-going dialogue with the sound artist
        Toshiya Tsunoda (Yokohama, Japan). Toshiya Tsunoda develops an on-going
        philosophical line of enquiry regarding the art of field recording, as a
        conceptual act, and that of the relationship between the “field”, the
        recordist and the audience. During these investigations, he came to
        think about the meaning of choosing an object to focus on; drawing the
        conclusion that “perhaps it is similar to a hunter who becomes more
        interested in shooting the bow than the prey itself”.</image:caption
