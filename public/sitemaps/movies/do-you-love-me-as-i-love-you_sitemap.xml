        >Tien Xiao-Xiang is a fan of author Si-Yi and Tarot cards. But deep
        down, she has another love, childhood sweetheart Li Zhu-Hao. Just when
        she sees the perfect opportunity to reveal her love to him from
        fortunetelling, Li Zhu-Hao confesses his feelings to her best friend
        Song Yi-Jing! But Song Yi-Jing has a condition for Li Zhu-Hao, that is
        to help three couples to date. They are: aloof and misandric art
        professor Stone and lovesick gym owner Liu Zhi-Liang; the most unpopular
        weirdo in school, Ah-Yu, and the subject of her nonstop public displays
        of love, campus hunk Danny Lo; mob boss lady Yu and philosophy student
        Ah-Shan. To make it happen for these three unlikely couples is almost
        like mission impossible.</image:caption
