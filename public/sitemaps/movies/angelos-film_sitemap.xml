        >Angelos Papanastassiou, the man behind the camera, a story of a Greek
        patrician of WW2 times Athens. In the very first days of the Nazi
        occupation Angelos decided to record and document the Greece
        motherland's sufferings. Using a clandestine 16-mm film camera risking
        daily his own, and his families life, filmed, documented the Nazi
        atrocities in Athens all through the German-Italian occupation.
        Meanwhile his daughter, Loukia was born and we follow her first steps as
        the family life images juxtaposed over the tragic chapter of modern
        Greek history. Angelos Papanastassiou secretly developed, edited and
        saved the films, which later become one of the principal evidence of the
        Nazi atrocities at the Nuremberg Trials 1947. The Angelos’ Film composed
        from a unique film journal of wartime Athens and offers a new insight to
        Greece’s past, with the music of Tibor Szemzõ.</image:caption
