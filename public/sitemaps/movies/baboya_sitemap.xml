        >The piercing cold of 10 below zero wasn't even a problem. In February,
        2009, about 400,000 people gathered in Myung Dong for a brief meeting
        for a single reason. The late cardinal KIM Sou-hwan became the first
        cardinal in a land of poor faith. He summoned up his courage when no one
        took action. He practiced love as a miracle until he left us. He was a
        respected senior of the society beyond the religion in the turbulent
        times; a figure whose life had been like a fence for the disadvantaged.
        The late cardinal KIM Sou-hwan was ‘a great man of the era’. His
        passionate love is now revived on the screen.</image:caption
