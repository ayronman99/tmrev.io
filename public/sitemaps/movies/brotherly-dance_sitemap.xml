        >Savo from Kikinda (Serbia) and his brother recall how they called
        communal service few years back to empty the septic tank in their
        backyard. As careless servicemen weren't coming for days, Savo staged
        his death by drowning in the hole. Communal service sent three trucks
        while Savo was looking at them from the attic. A story of a small man
        who fought the system and won, only to become a huge YouTube hero
        afterwards.</image:caption
