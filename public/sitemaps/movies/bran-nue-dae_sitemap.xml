        >In the Summer of 1965 a young man is filled with the life of the
        idyllic old pearling port Broome - fishing, hanging out with his mates
        and his girl. However his mother returns him to the religious mission
        for further schooling. After being punished for an act of youthful
        rebellion, he runs away from the mission on a journey that ultimately
        leads him back home.</image:caption
