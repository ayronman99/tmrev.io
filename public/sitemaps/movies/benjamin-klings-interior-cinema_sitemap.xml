        >Benjamin Kling is an audio describer. He translates movies for blind
        and visually impaired viewers. After more than a hundred audio described
        films and series and while working on Alfred Hitchcock's Suspicion, he
        feels the need to question his practice: is he too objective? Does he do
        justice to the films in all their diversity, in all their art, in the
        craft of the director? To answer these questions, he decides to meet
        blind and visually impaired people from different backgrounds. He wants
        to learn more about their singular way of "watching" films (they insist
        on saying “watching a movie”) and their expectations about audio
        description. What can we learn, us as sighted persons, from their way of
        experiencing cinema?</image:caption
