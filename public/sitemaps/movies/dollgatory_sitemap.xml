        >George Speedopoulos (Conor McLean) owns a Dollar Store where his daily
        life is riddled with zero revenue and harassment from his eclectic and
        eccentric customers, all the while supporting a disenchanted jobless
        wife (Nadia Qaquish). George soon decides that a very immediate remedy
        would be to kill off his wife, collect the insurance money, and
        celebrate a new unencumbered debt free life. However, God is watching,
        and in a surprising turn of events George mistakenly ends up killing
        himself. He subsequently wakes up trapped 24/7 in a purgatory world
        especially arranged just for him known as, Dollgatory. In order to be
        granted redemption and escape Dollgatory, George must convince his
        outlandish set of past customers (who are all out to destroy him), to
        renew their faith in God. Will George ever successfully pass his
        judgment day with God, or remain a prisoner in Dollgatory for eternity,
        only the viewer knows the final answer!</image:caption
