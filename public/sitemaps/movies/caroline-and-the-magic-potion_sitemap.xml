        >Caroline dreams of a life filled with adventure. Then one day, while
        living with her healer Granny and troublesome cat Mus, Caroline gets her
        chance. While looking through her granny's healing potions, Caroline
        stumbles across a magic formula that will make her fly. Jumping with
        excitement, Caroline turns an ordinary umbrella into her own personal
        flying broomstick. But magic isn't always used for good and when the
        evil leader of a manufacturing company finds out about the magic potion,
        she kidnaps Caroline's Granny in order to steal the recipe. When
        Caroline finds out, she jumps into action and starts off on the
        adventure of her lifetime to rescue her Granny.</image:caption
