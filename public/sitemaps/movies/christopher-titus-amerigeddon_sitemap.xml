        >2018, what the hell is going on? Hawaii just got an incoming nuclear
        missile threat and because of our new leader, people believed it. We
        have lost our way as a country. The world thinks we’re a joke and
        there’s a joke in the most powerful position in the world. I would give
        my yakuza pinkie right now for Mitt Romney. All that being said the new
        show is a killer balance between right and left. Thoughtful
        conservatives and my Grandma are starting to realize that we made a
        mistake. AMERIGEDDON is bringing the country together one drunk audience
        at a time. It’s for all of us because it takes one side, The side of
        America. Don’t worry about anything people! It’ll be okay, we will
        survive, or live in a post apocalyptic gasoline fueled thrill ride where
        tribes fight each other over who should lead...just like now, except
        we’ll all have Mohawks.</image:caption
