        >David Attenborough returns to the island of Madagascar on a very
        personal quest. In 1960 he visited the island to film one of his first
        ever wildlife series, Zoo Quest. Whilst he was there, he acquired a
        giant egg. It was the egg of an extinct bird known as the 'elephant
        bird' - the largest bird that ever lived. It has been one of his most
        treasured possessions ever since. Fifty years older, he now returns to
        the island to find out more about this amazing creature and to see how
        the island has changed. Could the elephant bird's fate provide lessons
        that may help protect Madagascar's remaining wildlife? Using Zoo Quest
        archive and specially shot location footage, this film follows David as
        he revisits scenes from his youth and meets people at the front line of
        wildlife protection. On his return, scientists at Oxford University are
        able to reveal for the first time how old David's egg actually is - and
        what that might tell us about the legendary elephant
        bird.</image:caption
