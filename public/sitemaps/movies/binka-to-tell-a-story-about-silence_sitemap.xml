        >A film pioneer, Binka Zhelyazkova was at the forefront of political
        cinema under Bulgaria's Communist dictatorship. Though she remained
        faithful to the communist ideals she became an avid critic of the regime
        and brought upon herself the wrath of its censorship. As a result four
        of her nine films were shelved and released to the public only after the
        fall of the regime in 1989, and Binka Zhelyazkova became known as the
        bad girl of Bulgarian cinema. A provocative portrait that reveals the
        pressures and complexities that arise when art is made under
        totalitarianism.</image:caption
