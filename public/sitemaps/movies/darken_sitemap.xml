        >Darken is set in a bizarre, mysterious, and violent unknown world with
        danger and death around every corner. After a young woman is accosted by
        a dying warrior in the middle of the street, a bizarre incantation
        propels her into the realm of Darken - a violent prison-like world of
        labyrinthine rooms, interconnected with no apparent rhyme or reason and
        no way of escape. As she fights for survival within this brutal place,
        she finds allies who are rebelling against the rule of a self-appointed
        religious despot who demands allegiance to an all-powerful god called
        "Mother Darken." Eve and her allies must fight with everything they have
        if they are to have any hope of surviving the horrors Darken has in
        store for them.</image:caption
