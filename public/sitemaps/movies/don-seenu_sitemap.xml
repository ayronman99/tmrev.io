        >This story is all about a ambitious boy named Seenu (Ravi Teja) who
        dreams of becoming a don. He always likes to be called as ‘Don’ Seenu
        since childhood due to the strong influence of the Amitabh Bachchan
        starrer ‘Don’. He grows up with just one passion - that of becoming the
        World's No: 1 Don. Thanks to his enterprising nature, he gains access to
        the cream of the city's dons, and uses his cleverness to play off the
        top two - Machiraju (Sayaji Shinde) and Narsing (Sri Hari), fierce
        rivals - against each other.</image:caption
