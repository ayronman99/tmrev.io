        >Danko Babic is an ambitious and amoral gynaecologist at Croatia's
        leading fertility clinic. When his colleague Bantic is appointed as head
        of the clinic, Babic starts a secret war to overthrow his rival.
        Distracted by his ruthless campaign he makes series of fatal mistakes
        that result in the death of a patient. A crooked coroner and a corrupt
        police officer cover up his misdeeds, while Babic grows increasingly
        dependant on drugs and alcohol. He begins performing illegal abortions
        on prostitutes who work for Jedinko, a gangster who controls the local
        drug and sex trade.</image:caption
