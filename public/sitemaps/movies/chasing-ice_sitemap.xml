        >When National Geographic photographer James Balog asked, “How can one
        take a picture of climate change?” his attention was immediately drawn
        to ice. Soon he was asked to do a cover story on glaciers that became
        the most popular and well-read piece in the magazine during the last
        five years. But for Balog, that story marked the beginning of a much
        larger and longer-term project that would reach epic
        proportions.</image:caption
