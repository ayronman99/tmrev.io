        >Since the invention of the light bulb, natural darkness is increasingly
        invaded by artificial light. Once, light was considered unconditionally
        as an entirely positive element: the more light, the better. It
        increases safety and has a positive effect on our moods, but scientists
        are discovering that light also has a dark side as we are discovering
        its many unforeseen consequences.</image:caption
