        >Natasha is a TV host assigned to cover the mysterious happenings on
        Pulau Indah Kayangan. Together with her crew, Adam and Dino, they
        explore the island, which was solely inhabited by local tribes until a
        big company decides to develop it as a tourist attraction. Upon arrival
        at the island, they are met by a handsome but mysterious young man named
        Cook who has been assigned as their guide on the island. As Cook takes
        them around the island to start their investigation, they start to
        experience frightful ghostly visions and witness horrific murders on the
        island. Difficulties and challenges continue to mount as the aborigines
        on the island also start to get aggressive and hostile towards their
        presence. As they struggle with the mysterious findings and hostile
        environment, they must quickly determine if they are being led further
        from sanity or closer to the truth.</image:caption
