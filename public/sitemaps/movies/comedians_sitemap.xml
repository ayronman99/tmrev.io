        >Six aspiring comedians tired of the mediocrity of their lives, at the
        end of an evening stand-up course they prepare to face their first
        performance in a club. In the audience there is also an examiner, who
        will choose one of them for a TV show. For everyone this is the great
        opportunity to change their life, for some it could be the last one. The
        performances begin and each comedian takes the stage with a great
        dilemma: to respect the teachings of their master, devoted to
        intelligent and uncompromising comedy, or to twist their numbers to
        satisfy the much less refined taste of the examiner? Or maybe look for a
        third way, one of absolute originality? Through the stories of six
        comedians, Comedians is a reflection on the very meaning of comedy in
        our time, facing absolutely topical issues.</image:caption
