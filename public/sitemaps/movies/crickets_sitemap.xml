        >Kaoru, a wealthy woman whose youth is fading, abandons the hustle and
        bustle of the city to live a peaceful life in a house on the coast.
        There she takes care of an old deaf, dumb and blind man as if he were an
        insect, a child or a pet. He canâ€™t do anything for himself, so she feeds
        him and accompanies him on his walks. This strong mutual dependency
        offers Kaoru an escape from society and allows her to free herself from
        restrictions imposed by common sense.</image:caption
