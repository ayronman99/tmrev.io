        >London gentleman David spends a day and all his cash to bring his
        one-night stand a presentation folder at her office in Liverpool, only
        to be rather rudely ignored a minute later. After a night on the
        streets, he meets diner waitress Tina, who takes pity on him. David wins
        spending money at the race tracks and decides to spend it on a playful
        tour of the city guided by Tina, which is mainly an excuse to get close
        romantically and learn about each-other.</image:caption
