        >Temmuz is an openly gay sculptor living at a flat with his dog in
        Istanbul. He lives a bohemian lifestyle and has a happy go lucky,
        carefree, eccentric (such as believing in good luck charms) character,
        frequently distracting him from his work as a children's book
        illustrator, and eventually leading him to be abandoned by his boyfriend
        via e-mail. He is given solace and affection by her wealthy mother, who
        is fully supportive of him, and best friend and co-worker, Beste. In the
        meantime, he keeps seeing a young man in his dreams, who repeatedly
        calls him for help and rescue. One day he runs into this guy while
        getting on the bus, who is accompanied by his mother, and helps them get
        into their home as the young man was born without limbs. From then on,
        two lives would collide into each other, starting a brotherhood full of
        discoveries and mutual help.</image:caption
