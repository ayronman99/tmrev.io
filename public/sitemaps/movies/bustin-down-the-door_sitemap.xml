        >During the winter of 1975 in Hawaii, surfing was shaken to its core. A
        group of young surfers from Australia and South Africa sacrificed
        everything and put it all on the line to create a sport, a culture, and
        an industry that is today worth billions of dollars and has captured the
        imagination of the world. With a radical new approach and a brash
        colonial attitude, these surfers crashed headlong into a culture that
        was not ready for revolution. Surfing was never to be the same
        again.</image:caption
