        >It seems that in recent years Angel sightings and experiences are
        everywhere. Perhaps this is because the world is more and more
        complicated and people are feeling exhausted from keeping up when time
        is moving too fast and they are endlessly distracted by technology which
        leaves them spiritually empty. Many people believe that Angels and
        Demons exist and are active in our world today. With demonic possessions
        on the rise and a world in chaos, it makes sense to those who have
        experienced and witnessed encounters with the divine that Angels exist
        and can help us cope with our everyday lives.</image:caption
