        >When mankind beams a radio signal into space, a reply comes from
        ‘Planet G’, in the form of several alien crafts that splash down in the
        waters off Hawaii. Lieutenant Alex Hopper is a weapons officer assigned
        to the USS John Paul Jones, part of an international naval coalition
        which becomes the world's last hope for survival as they engage the
        hostile alien force of unimaginable strength. While taking on the
        invaders, Hopper must also try to live up to the potential that his
        brother, and his fiancée's father—an Admiral—expect of
        him.</image:caption
