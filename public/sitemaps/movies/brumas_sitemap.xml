        >Fifty years have passed and the director meets Maria Jos√© again. She
        used to be a maid at his parents' house, when he was a child. From her
        he has heard the most fantastic stories. She was then eighteen and he
        was around six. The young woman became an elderly lady, a wrinkled great
        grandmother with the sea embedded in her eyes. She lives in a
        fishermen's village with white small houses perched at the edge of a
        cliff in Peniche, a neighborhood known as "Windows of the Sea". She now
        tells the story of her life in short sequences based on her experience
        and wisdom. Her story reflects itself in the personal and deformed
        narrative of the director. Seduced, the grandson and the great grandson
        all share a fabulous adventure. The games, the deep blue of the
        unpredictable Atlantic, under the splendor of the mists.</image:caption
