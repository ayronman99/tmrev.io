        >Dennis and Barb McDonald are empty nesters from the suburbs. On this
        day they get legal possession of their new house. They have privately
        purchased the burned out house directly from its owner. John Jeffery
        grew up in this house. He has been living on the property since the fire
        destroyed the house a year ago. John is the last of the old families
        with deep roots still on the street. He is now surrounded by recent
        neighbours who are more interested in retrofitting character homes than
        the people who live in them.</image:caption
