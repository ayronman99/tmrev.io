        >We follow Ichi during his high school years. Mr. Dai is the best
        fighter in school... whenever he fights Ichi is there and has a huge
        smile on his face. Mr. Dai thinks that Ichi is laughing at him but in
        fact he enjoys watching the violence that goes through the fights.
        Everyone is bullying, taunting and making fun of Ichi... even little
        kids from his karate class. Yet Ichi refuses to let go of his anger and
        fight others. Just when Mr. Dai is about to get Ichi, a new transfer
        student starts to make his own laws... by beating up everyone and
        breaking their bones! In a fight with the new student, Mr. Dai ends up
        on the ground, beaten and broken up from almost everywhere. It seems
        like this new guy wants to fight Ichi because supposedly he is the only
        one that could give him some challenge.</image:caption
