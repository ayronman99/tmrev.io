        >Filmed between 1945 and 1971, 16memorias tells the story of the Posada
        Saldarriaga, a Medell√≠n family that grew up amid the euphoria of
        industrialization, the sugar mills sugar bowls, trips to Miami, sows and
        balloons. Twenty five years of almost uninterrupted daily life that they
        were about to get lost in an old house they give us the strange
        possibility of seeing our childhood for the first time; to recover
        brother's accomplice smile when we conquer kingdoms that no one else saw
        and felt how powerful we were every time we received applause from our
        parents. Searching the origin of adult life and recognizing the distance
        that separates us from those scenes wonderful, what seemed to be a
        cluster of forgotten images becomes the only evidence that remains to
        ensure that there was a time when we believed that all days were to be
        warm, simple, and blue.</image:caption
