        >On 19 July 1965, the South-African poet Ingrid Jonker walked into the
        sea near Drieankerbaai in Cape Town at the age of 31. She left behind a
        little daughter and an oeuvre of three laurelled collections of poems.
        Jonker's work fell into oblivion, until on 25 May 1994 president Nelson
        Mandela opened the very first session of the first democratically
        elected parliament of South Africa with Jonker's poem Die kind wat dood
        geskiet is deur soldate by Nyanga, a poem from 1960 that refers to the
        demonstrations near Sharpeville. Mandela chose the poem for good reason;
        he called Jonker 'both an African and an Afrikaner'. A white person in
        South Africa cannot get a bigger compliment. In the documentary
        Korreltjie niks is my dood, director Saskia van Schaik reconstructs the
        poet's eventful life, making her powerful poetry with its South-African
        rhythm tell part of the story. (filmcommission.nl)</image:caption
