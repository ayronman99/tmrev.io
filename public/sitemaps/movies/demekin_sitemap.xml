        >As a child, Masaki Sata was teased and bullied because of his
        appearance and called “Demekin” (popeyed goldfish). He decided to fight
        back and eventually became unbeatable in fights. His red hair also
        became a trademark. Masaki Sata and his buddy Atsunari then spent their
        days fighting and riding motorcycles. After middle school, Masaki Sata
        went on to high school and Atsunari begins to work at a ramen
        restaurant. One day, Atsunari comes up with the idea of starting a
        motorcycle gang with Masaki Sata. What awaits for them are
        enemies.</image:caption
