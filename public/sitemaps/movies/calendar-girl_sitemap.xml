        >In my imagination, she came to me. Jong-moo is happy the calendar model
        Na-yeong is there smiling for him although they can't be together. One
        day, the girl of his dreams moves right next door to him and Jong-moo's
        boring life turns into excitement. Jong-moo learns about how she suffers
        behind the fanciness and he puts everything he has on the line to
        comfort her. Na-yeong is caught between his innocence and her work.
        Meanwhile, Jong-moo's friend Yong-jin dreams of a hot night with his
        cute girlfriend Ji-hee but every time he tries he stands on the verge of
        death and in the end Ji-hee confesses something to him... The two couple
        put their lives on the line for love.</image:caption
