        >Renee returns home one Saturday after giving an early morning piano
        lesson. She lives in the provinces with her husband Juan and their five
        year-old son Santi. Over breakfast, they discuss a possible move to
        Buenos Aires but rule it out after Juan provides a reasoned argument
        against it. He suggests a family trip to the beach. Renee proposes for
        Juan alone to take Santi to the beach while she takes her ailing mother
        Virginia to the country. The film bifurcates as the narrative alternates
        between the two excursions. Renee picks up Virginia at an
        assisted-living facility; they drive to a rustic cabin, sit by the
        fireplace and later take a walk in the forest. Juan and the inquisitive
        Santi travel further, to an almost empty beach, walk down a pier, build
        a castle out of sand, and meet two fishermen who entertain the boy with
        sea tales and teach him how to gut a fish.</image:caption
