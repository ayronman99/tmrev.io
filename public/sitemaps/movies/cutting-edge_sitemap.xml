        >This one-hour verit√© documentary shows a day in the life of a
        successful barbershop on Harlem's 125th Street. The film shows the vital
        role community barbershops play as a forum for black men to discuss any
        topic, whether controversial or banal, sacred or profane, political or
        personal, in an environment of heated debate and/or male fellowship.
        Topics discussed in the film include HIV/AIDS, infidelity, gay marriage,
        greedy preachers, Bill Clinton, the world's sexiest actresses, and more.
        Though in some ways this is a quintessential black barbershop, where
        macho attitudes often prevail, women do play a role in the shop's
        conversations, and with the increasing gentrification of the area, a
        number of diverse clients (including a white gay man) occasionally enter
        the mix.</image:caption
