        >In 2003, the British broadsheet newspaper The Guardian famously
        declared that ‘dance music was in terminal decline’. Citing the greed of
        superstar DJs and unimaginative, uninspired music as the reason fans
        were leaving the genre, it seemed at the time to be the lowest point for
        dance. Yet out of these ashes rose some of the most seminal dance record
        labels of today. 2003 was the year in which Toolroom, Size, Cadenza, Ed
        Banger, Refune, Armada and Buzzin Fly were born. Despite emerging in the
        toughest year for the music industry, these labels survived and were
        eventually flourishing in 2013, ten years later. This documentary tells
        the story of this explosive decade.</image:caption
