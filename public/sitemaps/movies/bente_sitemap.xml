        >A back to back treatment of a malaise which has shocked Philippine
        society for the past so many years: the mysterious disappearances and
        killings of Filipino journalists and activists. The film focuses on a
        hard-hitting radio commentator and his conflict with a former classmate
        who is a suburban town mayor. The radioman’s story runs parallel to the
        tale of a student-activist on the run with his activist-girlfriend.
        These parallel stories are interwoven with a third story, that of the
        former military man , now their would-be assassin. This killer’s
        unexpected obsession with his wife leads to a climax of murder and
        mayhem.</image:caption
