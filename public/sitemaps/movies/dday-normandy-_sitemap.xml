        >June 6, 1944: The largest Allied operation of World War II began in
        Normandy, France. Yet, few know in detail exactly why and how, from the
        end of 1943 through August 1944, this region became the most important
        location in the world. Blending multiple cinematographic techniques,
        including animation, CGI and stunning live-action images, “D-Day:
        Normandy 1944” brings this monumental event to the world’s largest
        screens for the first time ever. Audiences of all ages, including new
        generations, will discover from a new perspective how this landing
        changed the world. Exploring history, military strategy, science,
        technology and human values, the film will educate and appeal to all.
        Narrated by Tom Brokaw, “D-Day: Normandy 1944” pays tribute to those who
        gave their lives for our freedom… A duty of memory, a duty of
        gratitude.</image:caption
