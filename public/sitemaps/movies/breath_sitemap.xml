        >It is the story of a deaf girl in Shanghai. Despite the hectic pace of
        the city, she still feels a strong sense of loneliness. Although there
        are multiple parties and opportunities to meet new faces, she still
        feels unique in the crowd. At the end of the film they explain that many
        people who suffer from deafness are diagnosed with depression or
        anxiety. The girl represents all those millions of beings in the world
        that are not included.</image:caption
