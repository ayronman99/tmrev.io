        >Some thirty years ago, a working-class subculture was taking grip of
        cities across the UK that has left a lasting legacy. This began on the
        back of the mod revival of the late 1970s when notorious football firms
        from the cities like Liverpool, Manchester and London stole expensive
        designer sportswear from the countries they visited. It didn’t start
        with the high-street giants telling these lads what to wear. Instead,
        they set the trends and the high-street stores caught up. As the 1980s
        began in Britain, under the radar the ‘casual’ had already arrived. From
        Barcelona to Berlin, Milan to Moscow, teenagers today are copying
        fashions and a culture that developed on the streets and terraces of
        British cities. But how did the football casual subculture come about?
        What did they stand for? What made them tick? Why it’s legacy is still
        having an impact on today’s fashion industry.</image:caption
