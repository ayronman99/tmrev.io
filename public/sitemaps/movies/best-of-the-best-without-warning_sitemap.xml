        >A group of Russian mobsters have stolen a huge supply of paper for
        printing U.S. currency, and are now flooding the market with conterfeit
        bills. When one of the mobsters decides to give herself in and hand over
        a data CD to the DA, she is shot and killed, but not before handing the
        disc to an unsuspecting Tommy Lee. Despite working with the police as a
        martial arts instructor, Lee doesn't go to the cops with the disc, but
        instead goes on the run, giving the mafia time to kidnap his daughter
        and hold as a hostage in exchange for return of the disc. Will Tommy
        ever see his daughter again?</image:caption
