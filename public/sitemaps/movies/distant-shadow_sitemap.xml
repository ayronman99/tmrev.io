        >Michelle Wallace is a girl haunted by the demons of her past, having
        witnessed the brutal murder of her mother at the age of four. Sixteen
        years on she lives in a run-down boarding house looking forward to a
        future with her boyfriend away from the squalid life she has been
        leading. Michelle is befriended by her new neighbour, Charles Paskin, a
        mysterious middle-aged man. Unbeknown to Michelle, Charles is actually a
        British government assassin involved in a highly confidential operation.
        His mission is to retrieve government files about a top secret operation
        which has been stolen. He has been instructed to dispose anyone
        associated with these documents, but all is not as it seems. Through a
        bizarre turn of events, Michelle becomes embroiled in Charles's mission,
        and a fast-paced story of intrigue and suspense begins to
        unfold</image:caption
