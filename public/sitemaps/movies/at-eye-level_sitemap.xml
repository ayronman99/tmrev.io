        >11-year-old Michi lives in a children's home, every day fighting to win
        the respect of the other kids, till the day he finds his real dad, Tom -
        who happens to be a dwarf, even shorter than Michi is, the opposite of
        his idea of manliness and strength. When the kids find out, Michi's life
        becomes hell and he flees. With nowhere to go, he moves in with Tom, who
        is new to this fatherhood thing, while Michi tried to hide his
        embarrassment and shame from his fellow school kids. This forces Tom,
        who had coped well till now, to confront his handicap head on. As time
        passes, they discover they have more in common than other sons and
        fathers, until their relationship is again suddenly put to the hard
        test...</image:caption
