        >Financial Officer Katharina Kamp has to collect tax debts from the stud
        owner Carl von Balkhausen. She arranges a local appointment, but the
        grumpy squire ignores her. When Katharina unexpectedly loses her brother
        and his wife in an accident, she initially has very different worries.
        She lovingly takes care of her niece Lara, who survived the accident and
        now sits in a wheelchair indefinitely. By chance, Carls and Katharina's
        paths intersect again. He and his horses work wonders for Lara and
        Katharina.</image:caption
