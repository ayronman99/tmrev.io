        >For many families at Cattle Creek Campground, the annual camp meeting
        signifies a time of fellowship when families can spend a week away from
        the hectic pace of modern life. Children learn that they can live
        without air conditioning and television. During the day, they engage in
        water fights or make numerous visits to the "store," where cold
        pineapple sherbet is sold. Grownups sit in lawn chairs in the front or
        back of their "tent" and talk about the latest news, how the children
        are growing up and what has happened since the last camp meeting. And
        there is plenty of food. Everyone prepares an abundant supply of their
        best recipes. Nightly preaching is scheduled at the tabernacle, a large,
        open structure with a tin roof, wooden benches and a gravel floor. Many
        a young child has kicked the gravel there to watch the dust fly and then
        been admonished by a watchful mom or dad, in some cases
        both.</image:caption
