        >Dead by Monday is a darkly comic tale of love and death... but not
        necessarily in that order. Julie is a sweet, vulnerable young woman who
        lacks confidence and is obsessed with the memory of her dead husband
        whom she idealizes. Alex is an angry writer. Talented but unable to
        repeat the success of his first novel, he has nothing left to say. Or
        live for. He just wants to die. Fate introduces these two lost souls at
        the edge of a cliff. While picking flowers Julie accidentally falls off.
        Alex, who has come to blow his brains out, is interrupted by her cry for
        help, just before he pulls the trigger.</image:caption
