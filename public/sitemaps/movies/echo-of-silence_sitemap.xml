        >In a small town of Hokkaido, Yunni, Fusako Kurokawa (Saki Takaoka),
        lives a quiet life with her father. Life here is very simple, but it is
        good enough and she is happy enough. Days go on as usual. with some
        coincidence, she meets this man one day, Wataru Kadokura (Atsuro Watabe)
        a man who cannot speak. A very peaceful "time" now becomes part of her
        daily life as this strong emotion suddenly takes place in her simple
        quiet life.</image:caption
