        >The love story of sixteen-year-old Arturs is interrupted by the First
        World War. After losing his mother and his home, he finds some
        consolation in joining the army, because this is the first time national
        battalions are allowed in the Russian Empire. But war is nothing like
        Arturs imagined â€“ no glory, no fairness. It is brutal and painful.
        Arturs is now completely alone as war takes the lives of his father and
        brother. Also, no progress is made in the promised quick resolution of
        the war and timely return home. Within the notion that only he alone
        cares about returning home and that his homeland is just a playground
        for other nations, Arturs finds strength for the final battle and
        eventually returns home to start everything from scratch, just like his
        newly born country.</image:caption
