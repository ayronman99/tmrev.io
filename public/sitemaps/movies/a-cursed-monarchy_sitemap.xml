        >It is the early 1300's and the treasury of France, under the rule of
        Philippe IV (Philippe le Bel or Philippe the Beautiful), is empty. The
        king decides the only solution is to raid the treasures of the Knights
        Templar (amongst others) and concocts various charges of treason, heresy
        and deviance against the Knights and their Grand Master Jacques de
        Molay. Having confessed under torture to the crimes of which he is
        accused, de Molay is condemned to be burned at the stake. With his dying
        breath he curses the king, the king's advisor (Guillaume de Nogaret),
        the pope (Pope Clement V) and the thirteen succeeding generations of
        their families. There follows one of the most dramatic periods in French
        history, half a century of political intrigue, murder, treason, war and
        famine, which ultimately culminates in the 100 Years War.</image:caption
