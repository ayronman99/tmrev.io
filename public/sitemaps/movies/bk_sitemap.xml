        >The story takes place on New Year's Eve that a group of friends have
        been celebrating together for years. The host is the newly divorced
        psychologist, Aliz, and her guests are her younger brother, Döme, the
        chemistry teacher, Kristóf, the gynecologist, Gábor, the cook, and Márk,
        the photographer. They are all childhood best friends. In the meantime,
        Gábor's wife, Saci, the lawyer, and Márk's girlfriend, Fanni, the young
        special education teacher joins the group. The topic of the conversation
        veers in the direction of how nowadays people store many secrets and
        confidential information on their cell phones, and what kinds of
        conflicts may arise if the phones fall into unauthorized hands. Each of
        the seven members of the group insists on not having any secrets, on
        their lives being an open book, to which Aliz suggests that they should
        prove it.</image:caption
