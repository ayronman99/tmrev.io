        >Uptight French chef, Sara Westbrook, gets fired up when her upscale
        caf√©, Chez Varenne, is suddenly overshadowed by a new restaurant moving
        in next door run by a group of rowdy firemen. Led by handsome former
        fire fighter Gill Callahan and his friend Danny, The Five Alarm Grill is
        soon a big success while Sara and Patsy, her pastry chef, struggle to
        bring in customers. Sara suddenly softens when she meets Gill's
        ten-year-old daughter Hannah. Ignoring the obvious tension between her
        dad and Sara, Hannah is soon playing matchmaker. Can Gill and Sara's
        burgeoning romance survive the temptation to compete with each other, or
        will the heat of competition drive them apart?</image:caption
