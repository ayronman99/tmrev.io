        >Clash in the College is an exploration of conflicts that emerge in the
        lives of college students when political ideologies erupt in their
        midst. The film shows how students get indoctrinated and how it impacts
        their lives. James and Elvyn's relationship has barely begun when
        politics begins to drive them apart. Evelyn has bonded with Maya, who
        believes it is the government's duty to help the less fortunate members
        of society. James, meanwhile, has joined a campus group led by Quentin,
        a conservative activist. Completely, filmed and produced in Centre
        County, Pennsylvania, Clash in the College covers a wide range of social
        and political issues, including abortion, immigration, government
        spending and education, while emphasizing finding middle ground where we
        can all agree.</image:caption
