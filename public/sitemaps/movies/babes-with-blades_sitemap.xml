        >On the dark streets of Draiga, a mining colony occupied by the Visray
        Empire, lives Azura, the last of a fearsome warrior race known as the
        Sarnians. After witnessing her once beautiful home world turn into a
        lifeless husk, Azura must fight to the death in the gladiatorial ring to
        stay alive. Meanwhile, a group of human freedom fighters form a
        resistance, seeking to try and protect their families from the
        oppressive and cruel rule of the Visray Section Commander Sorrentine.
        Unbeknownst to Azura, the fate of all humans on Draiga is about to rest
        in her hands. Can she survive long enough to save her
        colony?</image:caption
