        >5150 ELM'S WAY is located at the end of a quiet street in a small town.
        When Yannick fell off his bike, he knocked at the door of the Beaulieu
        residence so he could clean the blood off his hands. But Jack Beaulieu
        and his family had other plans for Ian. Beaulieu is a righteous
        psychopath and fanatic chess player who wants to rid the world of evil.
        And even though Ian has done nothing wrong, he is beaten, tortured and
        tormented before Beaulieu makes him an offer: win at chess and he is
        free to go. And so Ian is now a pawn in Beaulieu 's game. A game in
        which he will either lose his mind or his life.</image:caption
