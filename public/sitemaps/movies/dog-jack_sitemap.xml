        >"Dog Jack" is the story of a slave boy and his dog who escape the
        master's plantation, join the union army, and have to face their former
        master on the battlefield. The story is inspired by the historical
        true-life adventures of the beloved mascot of the Pennsylvania 102nd,
        who was so prized by his regiment for his skills in battle that he was
        twice exchanged for a Confederate prisoner of war.</image:caption
