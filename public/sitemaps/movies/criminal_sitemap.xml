        >Arjun and Mahi have been married for 4-5 years, but their relationship
        is not what it used to be. Now they are hellbent on divorcing each
        other. Their common friends, Gagan, and Jasleen, try to patch things up.
        While doing it they plan a holiday together which gets cancelled
        somehow. They come back not realizing that 5 prison escapes are now
        hiding in their house. In their own home, they become prisoners in
        hiding.</image:caption
