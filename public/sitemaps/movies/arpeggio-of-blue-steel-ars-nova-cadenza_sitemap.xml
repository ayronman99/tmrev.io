        >The group of privateers known as the Blue Steel continues their mission
        to deliver blueprints of the Vibration Warhead Torpedo, a weapon that
        may turn the tides of war in their favor, to the United States. However,
        a new threat arises from their enemy, the overwhelming Fleet of Fog in
        the form of "The Student Council", a group of warships composed of the
        remaining Mental Models, the ships' humanoid avatars, who have yet to
        face the unpredictable captain of the Blue Steel, Gunzou Chihaya. As the
        Blue Steel gets closer to understanding the origins of the authority
        controlling the enemy, Iona's past reveals the beginning of the war and
        her reason for siding with humanity.</image:caption
