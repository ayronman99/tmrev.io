        >A documentary that explores the life of one of the world's most
        populated cities from its streets. Shot in 2009-2012 (before and during
        the Egyptian revolution, and ending with the most recent presidential
        elections), the film explores the country's collective identity,
        inherent struggles, and the sentiments that lead through the historic
        changes taking place in Egypt today. For his third documentary,
        Egyptian/ American filmmaker Sherief Elkatsha rides through the
        congested streets alongside a diverse cast of characters-from taxi
        drivers to ambulances, from traffic cops to private citizens-capturing
        the unspoken codes of conduct, frustrations, humor, fatalism, and
        life-or-death decisions of driving in a city where the only rule is:
        there are no rules.</image:caption
