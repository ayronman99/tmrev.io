        >The summer of 2010, like many other years. I stay with my parents in
        Tsukishima on the banks of a river that joins Tokyo Bay. An uneventful
        ritual visit except that I decided to go and see and hear my brother for
        the first time since he locked himself up in the darkness of his room,
        too small for his size. Will I meet a drunken monster who only shouts
        grotesque words at his sisteras I had imagined him to be for so
        long?</image:caption
