        >Desert and Rocky Mountain Bighorn Rams III is a series of fantastic
        hunts throughout the past three years (1997 - 1999) and includes two
        years of hunting scenes from Alberta Canada's auction tag. You'll see
        George Harms take a state record desert ram in California, and a world
        record CA Bighorn with a bow. Bighorn 3 also follows Gary Hansen's #3
        state record Idaho Bighorn hunt, and through Oregon for a CA Bighorn.
        Mark Almgreen takes a great desert sheep with a muzzleloader, Ann Palmer
        shoots a great desert ram in Arizona, and we'll see a pistol hunt that
        completes all four methods of hunting. With two additional Bighorn
        scenes, Bighorn III highlights nine outstanding hunts and closely
        focuses on field judging rams between 160 and 208 Boone and Crockett
        points.</image:caption
