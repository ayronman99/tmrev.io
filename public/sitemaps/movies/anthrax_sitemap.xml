        >When cattle mysteriously start dying of anthrax in a small Alberta
        ranching community, an RCMP officer tries to keep the peace as ranchers
        lay the blame on a local agricultural research center. A reporter
        encourages the angry ranchers - led by the Mountie's mother-in-law - to
        stage a sit-in at the research center. When an eccentric old rancher
        dies after being exposed to a deadly strain of anthrax, the protesters
        are quarantined. No one notices that the reporter has disappeared -
        along with several vials of the deadly bacteria. The RCMP officer begins
        his own investigation, gleaning information from a U.S. government
        agent. He finds himself racing against time to recover the stolen
        anthrax.</image:caption
