        >If you've ever listened to pop music from the 1960s and early 1970s,
        you've heard the (probably uncredited) work of The Wrecking Crew. The
        Wrecking Crew were a group of in-demand Los Angeles studio musicians who
        played on hundreds of iconic hits, including the Beach Boys' "Help Me,
        Rhonda" and The Mamas and The Papas' "California Dreamin'." Many
        different musicians played as part of the loosely organized Wrecking
        Crew, but there were three mainstays: drummer Hal Blaine, guitarist
        Tommy Tedesco, and guitarist and bassist Carol Kaye. Kaye was one of the
        few females working session musicians of the era. According to Vulture,
        both The Beach Boys' Brian Wilson and super producer Quincy Jones have
        referred to her as the greatest bassist in the world.Â </image:caption
