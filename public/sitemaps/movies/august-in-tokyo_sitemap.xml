        >In a corner of Tokyo, a man named Natsuo lives as a yakuza and a woman
        named Natsuki works part-time. Although they rarely think about their
        families, they attempt to reunite with them. Brother and sister, father
        and daughter; the distance between them begins to shrink, but... This
        film portrays the dynamics of people trying to co-exist in nature and in

        forward. This is a movie about their small footsteps.</image:caption
