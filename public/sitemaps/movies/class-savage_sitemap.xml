        >Before we can join society as productive and acceptable human beings,
        we are forced to endure a difficult and trying experience - high school.
        In a world run by youth, primal attributes dictate who is 'King of the
        Classroom'. When Marty, a troubled but talented teenager, moves into the
        locker beside his school's 'Classroom King', a charismatic but grossly
        sadistic cocaine dealer, his position on the high school food chain
        sinks to an unsurpassed low. Marty is forced to make the decision of his
        life: put up with the savage humiliation, or respond with the same
        primal attitude he is attacked with. His choices slowly but surely
        reveal who is Class Savage.</image:caption
