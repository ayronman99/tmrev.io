        >"That imbecile grandiose who does not know Lourie!" â€“ Vladimir
        Mayakovsky once proclaimed. At the beginning of the century, the name of
        this composer and musician thundered no less than the names of Prokofiev
        or Stravinsky. The star of the Stray Dog Cafe, a colleague of
        Khlebnikov, Miturich, Annenkov and Mandelstam, after the revolution he
        headed the music department of the People's Commissariat for Education,
        becoming the main one in the country "for music". At the same time, his
        affair with Anna Akhmatova took place. They lived together for only a
        few years, until Arthur Lourie decided to leave for the West. They were
        able to write to each other again almost half a century later...
        People's Artist of Russia Svetlana Kryuchkova and People's Artist of
        Russia Valery Kukhareshin were filmed in the film. Artur Lurie's music
        was performed by the "XX century" ensemble under the direction of Maria
        Khodina, grand pianos Sergei Oskolkov and Daniil Yekimovsky, soprano
        Victoria Evtodyeva.</image:caption
