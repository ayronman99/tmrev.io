        >Blow Debris similarly suggests narrative but prefers to offer it in the
        form of a drifting, almost aimless experience; the piece enacts a
        passage or journey as we follow a group of nude wanderers in a desert
        landscape. As with Electric Earth, what could be postmodern anomie
        becomes celebratory drifting. Aitken spurns a romantic nostalgia for a
        pristine past and its untrammeled landscapes in favor of the stories
        suggested by the discarded remnants and detritus that litter the expanse
        of the Mojave Desert. He also fetishizes the feeling of the desert. Even
        in the cool, dark space of the gallery rooms housing the huge
        projections, you sense the lassitude of the characters and time seems to
        slow down. And then things explode, time reverses, and you are compelled
        to walk around some more, from dislocation to relocation and back
        again.</image:caption
