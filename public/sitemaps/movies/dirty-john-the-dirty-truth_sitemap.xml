        >John Meehan created a terrifying trap of seduction, deceit and betrayal
        for countless victims. The illuminating revelations into his backstory
        showcase a series of events that flipped switches to create a monster
        wired for psychopathy. Goffard exposes John’s troubled background that
        built the foundation for his ominous fantasy world of lies and
        manipulation. In addition to hearing the Newell family’s terrifying
        tale, John’s first wife Tonia Bales and her daughters Emily and Abigail
        Meehan speak out, along with other women from his past who were caught
        in his web of lies.</image:caption
