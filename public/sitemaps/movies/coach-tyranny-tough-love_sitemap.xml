        >We know that Coach Tyranny is the most ferocious coach on the high
        school landscape, but this time, the real battles take place off the
        playing field. In the second episode of this animated series,
        unsuspected love interests force Tyranny into a tug-of-war over his
        heart and, ultimately, his soul. Meanwhile, a family get-together
        reminds Tyranny that his mother has never stopped teaching him eternal
        truths. Watch Coach Tyranny discover what it means to honor his mother
        and father, as well as learn other lessons God wants to teach all of
        us.</image:caption
