        >Itinerant Kurdish teachers, carrying blackboards on their backs, look
        for students in the hills and villages of Iran, near the Iraqi border
        during the Iran-Iraq war. Said falls in with a group of old men looking
        for their bombed-out village; he offers to guide them, and takes as his
        wife Halaleh, the clan's lone woman, a widow with a young son. Reeboir
        attaches himself to a dozen pre-teen boys weighed down by contraband
        they carry across the border; they're mules, always on the move. Said
        and Reeboir try to teach as their potential students keep walking.
        Danger is close; armed soldiers patrol the skies, the roads, and the
        border. Is there a role for a teacher? Is there hope?</image:caption
