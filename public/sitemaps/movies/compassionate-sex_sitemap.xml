        >Dolores is a mature and kind woman whose husband abandons her because
        he can't stand her uncanny generosity. Desperate to get her husband
        back, she devotes her life to works of charity, which is to go to bed
        with the other men of the town. Dolores, now "Lolita", becomes so famous
        that all men seek out her help now. It is through her compassionate sex
        that she brings back the colour and the happiness to a town that was
        immersed in sadness. Written by HoMordomo.</image:caption
