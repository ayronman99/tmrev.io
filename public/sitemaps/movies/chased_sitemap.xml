        >After leaving practice, collegiate football players Seth and Charlie
        are grabbing a pizza and planning for a relaxed weekend when everything
        in their lives takes a sudden turn. Accidentally offending some local
        thugs out front of the pizza parlor, the two athletes drop the pizzas
        and begin running for their lives with the thugs in close pursuit.
        Rounding corners and jumping walls Seth and Charlie begin to depend more
        and more on each other as the chase continues. Finally, after ducking
        through a hidden basement hatch, the adrenaline of the moment reveals
        that their dependence on each other extends far beyond the field and the
        chase. Over the next several days, Seth begins to struggle as he fights
        to come to grips with his sexuality and the intensifying feelings he now
        experiences for his lifelong friend. Eventually, risking the friendship,
        Seth caters to a love that can't be ignored only to find out that the
        feelings were mutual</image:caption
