        >The Academy of Country Music and Dick Clark Productions have announced
        they will tape an all-star concert special, ACM Presents: Tim McGraw’s
        Superstar Summer Night, on Monday, April 8, 2013 at the MGM Grand Garden
        Arena in Las Vegas and will be broadcast at a later date on the CBS
        Television Network. Fifteen time ACM Award winner, acclaimed actor and
        entertainer Tim McGraw is handpicking the hottest music of summer and
        calling on his friends to help kick off the 2013 touring season. Â The
        two-hour star-studded concert event will feature performances and
        collaborations from country, pop, rock and more, as well as a few
        surprise special guests from the worlds of film and television. Â All
        proceeds will benefit ACM Lifting Lives, the charitable arm of the
        Academy, and an organization that McGraw was closely affiliated with
        over his last tour.</image:caption
