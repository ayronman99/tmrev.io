        >Disposable Hero documents Brian's journey from hospital beds to podium
        tops!!! No one in freestyle has had it as good and as bad as Brian
        Deegan. Brian has collected more X Games and Gravity Games medals than
        any other competitor. He's appeared on the cover of Racer X Illustrated,
        Transworld Motocross & FreeriderMX. Features of him have appeared in not
        only these motocross industry related magazines but in FHM, ESPN The
        Magazine, DUB and Rolling Stone. Yet at the same time, he's accumulated
        more X-Rays, Pins, Rods, Plates, Casts, Gashes, and screws than most
        freestyle motocross riders. To top it all off, he most recently lost a
        kidney and severely injured his spleen while filming for MTV's Viva La
        Bam. "Disposable Hero motivates you to throw away your crutches and kick
        the weak in their ass, The Grim Reaper was at the door and Deegan did
        not answer." - Jerry Bernardo</image:caption
