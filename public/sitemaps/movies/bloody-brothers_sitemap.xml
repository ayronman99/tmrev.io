        >Frederick R. Fridel re-edited his first two features, Axe (1974) and
        Kidnapped Coed (1976) which both star Jack Canon, into a new movie that
        has both of these characters linked by the fact that they are twin
        brothers who were separated at birth having not known of the other's
        existence who would go on to each commit a horrific criminal act on the
        same date some 35 years later, and who's demise would bring them back
