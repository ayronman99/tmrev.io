        >Set in France during the mid-1970s, Vanessa, a former dancer, and her
        husband Roland, an American writer, travel the country together. They

        town they begin to draw close to some of its more vibrant inhabitants,
        such as a local bar/caf√©-keeper and a hotel owner.</image:caption
