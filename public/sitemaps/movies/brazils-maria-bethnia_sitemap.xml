        >This is a journey of friendship, an Argentinian is going to rediscover
        his continent while searching for his friend from Bahia. And while the
        work, the records and the career of this great lady of Brazilian music
        are well known, the starting point, the training, the first years
        remained till now in a vaguely legendary and imprecise blur. Thanks to
        many investigations that concern as many places as times, thanks to
        journeys back in time through the towns and regions, the film seeks the
        origins of Maria Bethânia’s voice and style. Helped and led by Bethânia
        herself, with the assistance of Caetano Veloso and Chico Buarque, the
        two princes of Brazilian music, along with the complicity of the great
        Gilberto Gil, the author is allowed to go to the first context : the
        North-East. In the family home in Santo Amaro, the film finally touches
        the childhood of Maria Bethânia – and her brother Caetano, and this
        mysterious point – from which the music radiates.</image:caption
