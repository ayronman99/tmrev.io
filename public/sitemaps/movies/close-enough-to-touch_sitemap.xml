        >Two families, two homes and too many secrets. The Hendersons are a
        textbook dysfunctional family: Jason is a money-hungry philanderer;
        Amanda is an inattentive alcoholic. And both are eagerly consuming
        whatever sordid sexual opportunities cross their paths. Then there's the
        kids: Suzanne is a fashion-model while Neal is halfheartedly following
        his father into a legal career. When the next-door neighbors - a sexy
        widow and her prudish daughter - arrive, it's only a matter of time
        before the curtain falls on this charade.</image:caption
