        >"Christian and Michael" is part one of a trilogy, with "Marietta" and
        "Northport". All three films explore the domestic life of a cultural,
        intellectual couple, Christian and Michael, a museum curator and an
        artist. In "Christian and Michael", the couple is at home in their
        apartment in Vienna, Austria, in the same apartment building where
        Christian grew up, a building that the family has owned since the aught
        years of the 20th century. Their space is surrounded by contemporary art
        as well as antiques and found objects. The interior is a form of self
        expression; the camera searches through the settings almost as a
        separate character, observing how space is filled and used, how culture
        is not left in the museum or office, but brought home as part and parcel
        of their daily lives. This film is in color, more essential to the lush
        yet modernistic environment.</image:caption
