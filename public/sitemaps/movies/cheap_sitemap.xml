        >An explicit thriller detailing the feasibility of producing and
        distributing snuff films, which are still only considered to be an urban
        legend. Driven mad by his failure to sell a profitable film to the porn
        industry, a director decides to create authentic snuff films with the
        assistance of two teenage runaways and a perverted cameraman. When the
        films bring in a profit through an amateur internet production company,
        they begin to see the film industry for what it really is: a world of
        backstabbing and double crosses. The group of twisted filmmakers then
        extract their own form of graphic revenge on the very people who made
        them successful.</image:caption
