        >The ABC telemovie event Dangerous Remedy tells the fascinating story of
        Dr Bertram Wainer. Living and working in Melbourne in the 1960s, Dr
        Wainer put his life at risk to expose police corruption in an effort to
        change the law on abortion and put an end to the illegal operations that
        were killing young women. It’s a truly inspiring story. Dr Wainer’s
        determination, even when his own life and that of his family’s was
        threatened, never faltered. He was living proof that one person can make
        a difference and change the status quo. With the support of Dr Wainer’s
        family, the filmmakers have endeavoured to capture the essence of his
        struggle to expose police corruption and change the law.</image:caption
