        >Narrated by Academy Award® winner Jeff Bridges, DREAM BIG: Engineering
        Our World is a first film of its kind for IMAX® and giant screen
        theaters that will transform how we think about engineering. From the
        Great Wall of China and the world's tallest buildings to underwater
        robots, solar cars and smart, sustainable cities, DREAM BIG celebrates
        the human ingenuity behind engineering marvels big and small, and shows
        how engineers push the limits of innovation in unexpected and amazing
        ways. With its inspiring stories of human grit and aspiration, and
        extraordinary visuals for the world's largest screens, DREAM BIG reveals
        the compassion and creativity that drive engineers to create better
        lives for people and a more sustainable future for us all. DREAM BIG is
        a MacGillivray Freeman film produced in partnership with American
