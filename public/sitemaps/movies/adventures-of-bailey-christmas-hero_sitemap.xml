        >It's "Christmas time" at the Baker household, and Bailey is at it
        again. Worried that he will not get any presents from Santa because he's
        been a bad doggie, Bailey learns about a mysterious Native American
        Indian called the "Handsome Fellow," who may be able to make his
        Christmas wishes come true. With thoughts of tennis balls, stuffed
        animals and more dog bones then he can count, he sets out to find this
        legend, inadvertently dragging his brother along for the ride. But when
        Bailey's misguided missteps cause harm to Duke and even threaten their
        family's Christmas plans, Bailey must not only find a way to save his
        brother, but he is also forced to make a big decision... one that just
        might enable him to finally understand the "true" meaning of
        Christmas.</image:caption
