        >A mysterious street-painter, Jouji, wanders aimlessly, homeless.
        Together with his homeless pals, he makes his living by selling his
        paintings on the street. His paintings, dynamically exploding on pieces
        of cardboard, catch the eyes of Kyoko, an art dealer. He can feel alive
        only if he keeps painting, but unable to find something to fill his void
        inside, he tries to drown himself in alcohol. Drawn to Jouji, Kyoko
        commissions him to paint for her. The two travel to a secluded
        mountain-side, and there Jouji becomes inspired both by the natural
        surroundings and Kyoko herself.</image:caption
