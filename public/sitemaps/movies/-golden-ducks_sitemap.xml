        >Devastated by a love affair, former in-demand gigolo Future Chang
        (played by Sandra Ng) retreats to Thailand, leading the life a
        dissolute. Thanks to the intervention of his high school teacher, Mr.
        Lo, Future summons the courage to return to Hong Kong. With the help of
        his friend Ricky, a gym trainer, he works hard to get back into shape,
        determined to make a comeback in the “duck” (male escort) trade. To
        Future’s surprise, Hong Kong has undergone a dramatic transformation
        since he left the city. Even the rules of the duck trade have completely
        changed! In order to ply his trade, Future is reduced seeking clients at
        an old age nursery home for women. Meanwhile, the places where women can
        buy happiness have become much more accessible, operating in
        neighborhood establishments such as a Thai restaurant…Determined to
        adapt to their new environment, Future and his desperate cohorts Dick
        Wide, Nebula and Broker Chan decide to dedicate themselves to satisfying
        the needs of their new client.</image:caption
