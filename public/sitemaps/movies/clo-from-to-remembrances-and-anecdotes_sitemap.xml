        >More than 40 years after making "Cléo de 5 à 7," Agnes Varda invites
        her star, two other cast members, and her assistant directors to look
        back. She takes us through the film, from opening scene to the end,
        visiting its Paris locales, placing her aged actors in the same spots,
        telling stories, and listening to others' reflections on the making of
        the film. She and they talk about making a film on a low budget, its
        showing at Cannes, and trying to fix a problem in the last shot. Her
        assistant directors discuss casting, costumes, sets, and the ways the
        film changed their approaches to filmmaking.</image:caption
