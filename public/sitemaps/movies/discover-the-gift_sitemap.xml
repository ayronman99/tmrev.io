        >Within each of us, there are special Gifts simply awaiting discovery.
        The sense of joy, power, fulfillment, freedom, and unconditional love
        that we experience in our lives is directly related to these Gifts, yet
        so many of us have yet to unlock their full potential, leaving us
        longing for a sense of happiness and fulfillment. For sister and brother
        team Shajen Joy Aziz and Demian Lichtenstein, something was missing in
        their lives until they tapped into the power of their own unique Gifts,
        leading to a profound personal transformation that has enabled them to
        connect to the fullness of life. Their incredible personal journeys of
        spiritual growth have fueled their desire to share what they have
        learned and in Discover The Gift, they share their story and take us
        step-by-step through this journey of discovery which has the power to
        change not only individual lives, but can transform our entire
        world.</image:caption
