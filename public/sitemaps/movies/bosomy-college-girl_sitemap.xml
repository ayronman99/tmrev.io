        >Hyeon-woo loves Seo-yeon for a long time and has been confessing his
        feelings constantly, but Seo-yeon refuses Hyeon-woo every time. Bo-ram
        and Min-jae always come together and drink together whenever Hyun-woo is
        dumped. However, Min-jae hides his relationship with Seo-yeon to
        Hyeon-woo. Min-jar tells Seo-yeon to stop teasing Hyeon-woo but Seo-yeon
        just enjoys the situation. Bo-ram who used to like her childhood friend
        Hyeon-woo, holds a special class to boost his confidence. He has become
        depressed after being dumped by Seo-yeon. Hyeon-woo is thankful for
        meeting Seo-yeon because of her. Only after some time did each of them
        know their real feelings.</image:caption
