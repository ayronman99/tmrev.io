        >High school student Takumi lives with his two mothers in a beautiful
        house in Tokyo. Moving into a house across the street is Sora and her
        two fathers. One day Takumi and Sora begin a quest to seek answers long
        hidden and silent in their unconventional families. Takumi sets out to
        determine the identity of his father, and Sora devises a plan to
        integrate herself fully into her family. The ordeals of these households
        stretch the traditional notions of family, convention and
        tradition.</image:caption
