        >Taylor Reynolds, a typical suburban mom, who made some bad life
        decisions and was sentenced to three years in jail for a DUI and
        possession of drugs. After her release, Taylor fights the stigma of her
        past misdeeds, works to regain the support of her daughter Bianca and
        husband Jeff, and once again become a contributing member of society.
        But just when Taylor's life is getting back on track, her former
        cellmate and career criminal, Meghan Flanagan, unexpectedly appears and
        invades Taylor's world. Meghan has a devious plan. She wants Taylor to
        come clean and confess the truth behind her early release. Taylor will
        stop at nothing to keep her family safe from Meghan, even if it means
        stepping back into the world she ultimately escaped.</image:caption
