        >Izzy is ready to make a difference in the world as she starts her
        career in public relations. When Grant Beiste - the big-headed corporate
        celebrity in town - accidentally hits her father with a car, Izzy is
        thrown into a public scandal that forces her to work closely with Grant.
        As she fights to save both her father and Grant's public image, she
        falls in love and learns not to judge a book by it's
        cover.</image:caption
