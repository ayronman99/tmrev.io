        >"Lewis Klahr's collage films have always mimed the processes of memory
        by pulling together the discards of contemporary life (images from ads,
        text books, or comic books, objects such as game pieces, menus, playing
        cards) into scenarios that seem like some Hollywood film dimly
        remembered. In Daylight Moon, he reaches even further back, to try to
        recall the moments in which a small child configures the world out of
        patterns of visual fascination, a mode of seeing that relies on touch
        and the feel of things rather than deep space. One of his most abstract
        films, Daylight Moon rarely reveals a human figure. Instead of
        characters, Klahr gives us the play of enigmatic spaces and empty sites
        that promise both the invitation of desire and the discovery of crime"
