        >Britta, the new girl in school Highland, has reason to be jubilant this
        Christmas: Her sadness has served to invoke Holly Boy, the holiday
        spirit, waking him from his deep slumber imposed by a dark elf, King
        Otto. This sets off a battle earthly and supernatural fury that develop
        simultaneously. The Young Britta must face her fears and death defying
        aerial action in the holidays from school, while Holly Boy has to fight
        against the forces of evil. Both battles must escape to save their
        lives, school, and the sacred forest, although, in reality, what is
        really at stake is the Christmas and values.</image:caption
