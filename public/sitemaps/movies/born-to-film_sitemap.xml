        >Three no-budget semi-professional filmmakers finally get their due in
        this witty but respectful documentary. Director Frederic Sojcher visits
        three fellow Belgian auteurs whose ambitions outstrip their budgets, or
        their recognition. Max Naveaux is a projectionist who decided to take a
        stab at making movies himself, putting together small-scale war films
        whose realism was heightened by the fact that the Belgian Ministry of
        Defense gave him permission to use real bullets for one of his movies.
        Schoolteacher Jacques Hardy has dabbled in creating film noir, costume
        horror, and comic-book adventures, most starring his friend Christian
        Vranken, who makes his living as a church caretaker and insists on
        casting approval for his female co-stars. And Jean-Jacques Rousseau is a
        self-styled surrealist whose commitment to obscurity is great enough
        that he insists on being interviewed while wearing a ski
        mask.</image:caption
