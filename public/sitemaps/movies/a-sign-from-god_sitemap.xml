        >Greg Watkins' romantic black comedy A SIGN FROM GOD depicts a
        semi-fictionalized day in the life of independent filmmaker Caveh (Caveh
        Zahedi) and his girlfriend Laura (Laura Macias) as they struggle with a
        series of challenges and accidents (including eviction from their
        apartment, possible pregnancy, and a car crash) while desperately
        seeking a sign from God about the future of their troubled relationship.
        Laura's increasingly pessimistic attitude she perceives that the
        cascading negative events of their lives portend a negative "sign" about
        the relationship is offset by Caveh's serene and abiding faith that
        everything happens for a reason... Director Greg Watkins is a frequent
        Caveh Zahedi collaborator. Watkins & Zahedi co-directed A LITTLE STIFF,
        and Watkins is the cinematographer of Zahedi's I DON'T HATE LAS VEGAS
        ANYMORE.</image:caption
