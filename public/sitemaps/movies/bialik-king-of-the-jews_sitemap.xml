        >By the age of thirty he’d already become the most famous poet in the
        Jewish world. He spent very few years living in Tel Aviv, but he loved
        the city dearly. Some 100,000 people attended his funeral in 1934. “King
        of the Jews” is a portrait of the most beloved Jew of his day, Chaim
        Nachman Bialik. Combining special animation, a voice track by Chaim
        Topol, rare archival footage, long-forgotten photographs, poems by
        Bialik performed by Ninet and interviews with the foremost Bialik
        researchers and fans in Israel and around the world, this film retells
        the story of the little boy from the shtetl, who became King of the
        Jews.</image:caption
