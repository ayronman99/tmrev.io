        >A documentary committed to exposing the way in which thousands of
        unemployed workers come daily into the city of Buenos Aires in order to
        sort and classify the garbage that neighbors leave behind every evening
        on their doorsteps. The movie, which took two years to film, shows the
        process of sorting and selling the trash collected by cartoneros that
        work independently as well as by those who have created co-ops in order
        to protect themselves from abusive middle management. The documentary
        follows the trash through the whole process: from the neighborhoodâ€™s
        sidewalk all the way to the paper mill. Among the many stages of
        garbage, the film also offers a reflection on the relation between
        garbage and art. This hour-long film unveils the complexity of informal
        recycling and its social, political and cultural
        implications.</image:caption
