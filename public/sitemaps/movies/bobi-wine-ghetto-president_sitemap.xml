        >Uganda has one the youngest populations in the world and one of its
        most flagrantly anti-democratic governments. These are ingredients for
        revolution, and Bobi Wine and his wife Barbie Kyagulanyi are stirring
        the pot. When the charismatic Bobi, a musician and member of parliament,
        announces his campaign for president, Uganda’s youth are ecstatic,
        filling parks and streets for every speech, and singing Bobi’s anthems
        of peace and freedom. But then comes the crackdown, orchestrated by
        Yoweri Museveni, a brutal dictator who has ruled Uganda for 36 years.
        Bobi and his crew survive arrests, beatings, torture, riots and
        raids.</image:caption
