        >Two newly wed men Anupam and Rajat who are established in life are
        henpecked husbands. They plot to flee from their wives and jobs. Due to
        a twist of another aspiring husband turned dacoit Bullet Singh all plans
        get spoiled. Finally things take a hilarious turn and end interestingly.
        The celebrated actors have put in their best. But Anirban Bhattacharya
        steals the show with his deliberately faulty speech. Some elements do
        not make it a family movie though. In spite of the U certificate some
        references do not make it suitable for children. Written by
