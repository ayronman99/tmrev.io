        >On October 16, 1992, an impressive and eclectic group of artists
        gathered at Madison Square Garden in New York City for the purpose of
        celebrating the music of Bob Dylan on the occasion of his 30th
        anniversary of recording. Bringing together musical greats as far-flung
        as Johnny Cash and Eddie Vedder, The Clancy Brothers and Lou Reed, the
        four-hour show celebrated a truly remarkable lifetime of songs in front
        of a sold-out audience of over 18,000. Warmly dubbed the Bobfest by
        participant Neil Young, the show was broadcast around the world and
        featured a cast of musical notables performing carefully chosen and
        often surprising selections from the incomparable Dylan songbook. At
        evening's end, the man of honor himself appeared on stage and gracefully
        brought it all back home again. In a world where all-star celebrity
        gatherings have become commonplace, the Bob Dylan celebration stood out
        as, first and foremost, a legitimately memorable musical
        event.</image:caption
