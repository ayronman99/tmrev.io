        >“9 Days Awake”, the film adaptation of the eponymous novel by Eric
        Stehfest. Jannik Schümann plays Eric, a junkie who lives to party. He is
        addicted to the one drug that makes him feel invincible- "like Jesus and
        the terminator at the same time." When he is accepted to an acting
        school in Berlin, he tries to reconnect with his great love Anja (Peri
        Baumeister), change his life, and strive to be better. But numerous
        conflicts and issues follow him, leaving him to retreat back to his old
        ways as other situations escalate.</image:caption
