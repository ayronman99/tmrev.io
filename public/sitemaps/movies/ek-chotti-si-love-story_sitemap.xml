        >Ek Chotisi Love Story (English: One Small Love Story) is a 2002
        romantic film directed by Shashilal K. Nair. The film is an adaptation
        of Krzysztof Kieślowski's A Short Film About Love (Krótki film o miłości
        1988). It is a story of 15-year-old Aditya (Aditya Seal) and his
        voyeuristic love of his nameless neighbor (Manisha Koirala) featuring
        bathroom masturbation scenes — which are virtually unseen in Bollywood.
        Soon Aditya’s hobby turns into infatuation as he begins to follow her
        movements closely. He feels sexually drawn towards her when he sees her
        coming out of her bath, her hair dripping wet. He feels jealous when he
        catches her making love with her boyfriend (Ranvir Shorey). Manisha is
        unaware of her secret admirer. When the boy musters up the courage and
        speaks his heart to her, she takes it in her stride and gives him a
        little teaser on adolescent love.</image:caption
