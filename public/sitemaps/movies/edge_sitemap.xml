        >EDGE. On the surface, it's the story of a madman terrorizing a helpless
        city, taking lives without a second thought. Blood is this man's water.
        Enter Jack Rivers, detective for the city's police department and ace
        headhunter who always gets his man. Stymied by the difficulty of
        catching this serial murderer, Jack begins to stumble in a blind fury
        and the line between 'justice' and 'murder' becomes blurred. This is the
        story of a man whose life is about to change forever. He's about to go
        over the EDGE.</image:caption
