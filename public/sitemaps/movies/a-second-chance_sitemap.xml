        >Julia and Moises fell in love and got married when they were young,
        idealistic, and passionate; now in their 30s, their marriage has cooled
        and their lives have sunken into the mediocrity they had sought to
        avoid. This realization inspires a quest to regain the lost dreams of
        their youth, which is complicated when a handsome student begins to
        pursue Julia. She begins an affair with the fiery young activist that
        may just put the excitement back into her marriage. This is a funny and
        insightful exploration of the intricacies of relationships, love, and
        idealism, and Jesus Ochoa as Moises turns in a stellar
        performance.</image:caption
