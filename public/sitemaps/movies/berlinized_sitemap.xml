        >The documentary BERLINIZED describes this very Berlin-specific attitude
        in a reflection on and a journey to mid-1990s' Berlin. Filmmaker Lucian
        Busse, an active protagonist of the period, documents the transformation
        of Berlin after the Wall. But Berlinized represents more than just the
        1990s - it is a metaphor for this virally catching creative feeling, the
        slightly rough directness, spiced up with a big dash of typical Berlin
        humor. Berlinized lets the former protagonists reflect how that
        temporary feeling of freedom shaped their individual lives, and to what
        degree that freedom can still be found among the neat order of today's
        Berlin. These reflections are as diverse as the interviewees and as
        multifaceted as the changes in those times.</image:caption
