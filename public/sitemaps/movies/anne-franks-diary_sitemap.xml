        >During World War II, a teenage Jewish girl named Anne Frank and her
        family are forced into hiding in the Nazi-occupied Netherlands, as she
        keeps a diary of the next few years. NOTE: This is a French *edited*
        version of the 1995 original anime film by Akinori Nagaoka, which is
        listed as some minutes longer (102, while the France edit is cut down to
        88). The edited version also replaced the original musical score with a
        more orchestral soundtrack. First shown in 1999 via festivals (some with
        an English dub), then released on DVD in 2000 with French audio &
        English subtitles, it took a while for an official English dub to be
        released next, but a trailer was posted on YouTube in April of 2015. The
        edited film with an English-audio dub was finally made available for
        free on YouTube as of May 2020. The "original" title in the info on TMDB
        is incorrectly in English but locked; the English should be in the
        "translated title" spot. It's in French on a poster though: Le Journal
        d'Anne Frank.</image:caption
