        >The teenage Chika feels empty after the death of her parents. Her older
        sibling is busy with her career and then her boyfriend breaks up with
        her. But Chika’s life starts to change when she meets Yoza. Chika
        accidentally destroys Yoza’s handycam, causing him to get hit by a taxi
        and hospitalized, thus causing him to cancel his departure to New York.
        Yoza dreams of becoming a filmmaker and he keeps asking her to replace
        his handycam. Chika is annoyed and confused because of his unpredictable
        attitude. Behind it all, Yoza keeps a secret that neither Chika nor
        anyone knows.</image:caption
