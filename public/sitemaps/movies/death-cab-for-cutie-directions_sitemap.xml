        >Death Cab for Cutie presents: Directions, an innovative anthology of 11
        short films inspired by each song on the band's acclaimed album Plans.
        Every song was directed by a different director and includes 2 bonus
        videos of unreleased songs. The unprecedented collection came about as
        the brainchild of otaku-house, the production company owned and run by
        childhood friends Nick Harmer, bassist for Death Cab for Cutie, and
        video director Aaron Stewart-Ahn. They saw the opportunity to enlist a
        variety of talented young artists to each make a short film set to a
        Death Cab song, without the constraints of the traditional music video-
        no arbitrary performance footage, the band themselves would not appear
        in the films. The ultimate goal was to create a series of small films
        that worked together as both individual pieces of art and as a unified
        whole.</image:caption
