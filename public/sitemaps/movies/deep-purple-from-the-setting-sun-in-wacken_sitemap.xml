        >The show is a blast from the first note to the last and grows song
        after song, supported by the audience impressive presence. During this
        concert, Deep Purple left their “safe zone”. That is why this concert is
        the one that represents a feeling of improvisation and electricity
        similar to the band's classic years - more than many other live releases
        by the band. The show has been filmed by 9 HD cameras and it is also
        available in 3D on the Blu-ray version (the first time for Deep
        Purple)</image:caption
