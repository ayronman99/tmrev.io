        >4TH &amp; GOAL is the epic tale of six young men in their quest to join
        the most elite club in professional athletics: the NFL. Shot over six
        years, we first meet Deqawn, Albert, Gibril, Tim, Randy, and Bret at the
        famed junior college football program at City College in San Francisco.
        We follow them through the 2003 championship season to the top D1
        collegiate teams in the nation and into their encounter with world of
        professional football. What their individual fates reveal is as much a
        prophetic tale of brotherhood, family and the harsh realities of growing
        up as it is about excelling on 100 yards of turf.</image:caption
