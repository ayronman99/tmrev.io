        >Every year thousands compete in the world's greatest singing
        competition - that you've never heard of. AMERICAN HARMONY journeys deep
        into the ultra-obsessive, zany, and heartfelt world of competitive
        barbershop singing, where passion is equaled only by raw talent, and the
        reward is not fame or fortune, but simply victory. The film focuses on
        four quartets vying to win the International Championships of Barbershop
        Singing, in what turns out to be the closest and most controversial
        victory in its 70 year history. Max Q is the heavy favorite - a
        superstar quartet comprised of former Champions. Looking to upset them
        is OC Times (The Heart-Throbs), Vocal Spectrum (The Rookies) and
        Reveille, an aging foursome who that has been together for 30 years. In
        total, fifty quartets duke it out for the coveted gold medal, while
        facing the pressures of quartet life - from big egos to brain cancer and
        everything in between. - Written by Colin King Miller</image:caption
