        >Four rogues, who were best friends as kids, have one big problem:
        they're sitting on both sides of the law. Martin is a policeman, while
        Nikolai, Ralf, and Timo can't distinguish between personal possessions
        and the possessions of others! When all four find themselves in a fix,
        they're forced to return to their former tricks against a common foe, Mr
        Niemeyer. Martin is not as successful, however, either at his job or
        marriage, and thinks he deserves a better life. Now he sees an
        opportunity to save his career by "playing" with his old friends on a
        mission that is so crazy that even the two foolish brothers can do some
        good.</image:caption
