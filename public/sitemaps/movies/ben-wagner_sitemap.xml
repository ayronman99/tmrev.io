        >George Wagner (Sam Bottoms) moves his wife and family, including son
        Ben (Justin Gocke), to a new town, where he begins a real estate job for
        Angelo Romano (Craig Clyde). Ben, a high school freshman, doesn't seem
        to get along with his busy, somewhat distant father. He finds
        consolation with a mysterious young girl, Regina (Bettina Rae), and her
        Grammy (Sylvia Sidney), who are both thought by the townspeople to be
        witches. Ben soon believes himself bewitched by Regina, a secret he
        shares with his sister, Liz (Jamie Ballard), and he becomes more
        confident, making the school's basketball team and earning better
        grades, while still searching for his father's approval. Ben's snotty
        teenage sister, Susan (Elizabeth Shumway), who's trying to stay friends
        with the stuck-up rich girl Ashley Addison (Amy Allred), blackmails Liz
        into learning about Regina, causing a near-fatal accident when Liz
        follows Ben to the lake and tumbles into a stream.</image:caption
