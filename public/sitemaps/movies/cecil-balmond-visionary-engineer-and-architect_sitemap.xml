        >"Cecil Balmond: Visionary Engineer and Architect" is a compelling
        documentation of a unique thinker and practitioner at the height of his
        architectural career. Through his conversation with architecture
        theorist and critic, Sanford Kwinter, Balmond reveals his vision and
        talent while the two tour his retrospective exhibition at the Graham
        Foundation in Chicago. Since the early 1980s Balmond has collaborated
        with many of today's important contemporary architects such as Toyo Ito,
        Rem Koolhaas and Daniel Libeskind. With his astounding aesthetic
        algorithms, Balmond has introduced innovative structural concepts that
        have resulted in some of the most challenging buildings in the canon of
        contemporary architecture.</image:caption
