        >Admittedly, it is not so often possible to see the birth, flowering and
        extinction of some creative direction in art during the life of one
        generation. Perhaps one of the rare examples of this kind gives us a
        creative direction that has gone down in history under the name "social
        art", which is regarded in the West as the most significant contribution
        of Soviet fine art to the world artistic process of the second half of
        the twentieth century. In our film, the fate of this creative direction
        is reflected by its brightest representatives â€“ Vitaly Komar, Alexander
        Kosolapov, Leonid Sokov, Boris Orlov, Rostislav Lebedev and Mikhail
        Roshal. Their collective story about the fate of "social art" unfolds
        against the background of the chronicle of the political and artistic
        life of the 70-90s.</image:caption
