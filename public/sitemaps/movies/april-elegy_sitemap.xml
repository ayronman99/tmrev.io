        >The poet Salvador Merlino didn’t live to see published April’s elegy,
        his last book, as he died when it was still in the printing press. His
        daughter Mary (72) and his son, Carlos (74), kept the parcels of copies
        of their father’s book stashed away for 50 years, high up, on top of a
        wardrobe. The curiosity of young Federico will force them to come face
        to face with themselves.</image:caption
