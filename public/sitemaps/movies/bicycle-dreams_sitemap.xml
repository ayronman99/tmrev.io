        >They are seekers, madmen, and angels hell-bent on riding across America
        on a bicycle in less than ten days. But what begins as the adventure of
        a lifetime is transformed in an instant when tragedy strikes the race.
        These voyagers discover what is truly at stake as they pedal on, praying
        for the deliverance only the finish line can bring. By journey's end,
        some are saved, others are lost, but all learn that the fuel that takes
        a soul toward its own true destiny is desire.</image:caption
