        >Four college students and an Iraq War vet, lost on a desert highway,
        encounter a terrified young woman with a black van on her trail. They
        survive the ensuing chase but their car doesn't, forcing them to seek
        help at a nearby ranch. Only when it's too late does the group learn
        that it's crossed the threshold into Hell! Welcome to the Web, home to a
        bizarre cult of murderers, perverts and mental defectives, whose
        sacraments include mutilation, dismemberment, unspeakable sex acts, and
        slow, agonizing death for all who enter. None of their "guests" have
        ever made it out alive. Tonight may be different...but don't count on
        it.</image:caption
