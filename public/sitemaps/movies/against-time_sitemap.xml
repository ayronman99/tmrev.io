        >About to finish high school, budding inventor Z.T. (Ean Mering) dreams
        of escaping both his sleepy town and his gloomy, widowed Dad, COLE
        (Craig T. Nelson). But his ambitions get a stunning reality check with
        the arrival of ZACK (Robert Loggia), a raving, 68 year-old drunk
        claiming to be the boy's older self. Suspiciously unable to recall the
        exact details, Zack is desperate to avert a single, tiny mistake he
        claims sent the rest of his years into a tragic spiral. As the two forge
        a shaky alliance to piece together the old man's fragile memory, Z.T.
        deals with the pressure from his well-meaning Coach (John Amos) and
        courts a new love, DELENA (Emilie Jacobs). After a devastating
        confession from Z.T.'s father, Zack's visit takes on new gravity, as one
        man, split in two by fifty lost years, realizes that both his future and
        past now hang perilously, in a race AGAINST TIME.</image:caption
