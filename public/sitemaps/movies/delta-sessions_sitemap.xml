        >Delta Sessions is a video put together by WestsideConnection.net that
        highlights the best riders on the Delta waterways in North Central
        California. The Delta is a huge set of waterways that were built for the
        purpose of farming and are fed by rivers on their way to the ocean. The
        waterways are narrow channels that are usually protected by large banks
        or bushes that block he wind making the Delta a great place to find
        endless smooth water. While you may have not heard of some of the riders
        in this video, the Delta is an area rich in style and wakeboarding
        talent, and this video seeks to showcase that talent. It's a high energy
        video that really gets you going.</image:caption
