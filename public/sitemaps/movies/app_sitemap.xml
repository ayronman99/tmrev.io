        >Love is dumb. Now there's an app for that. A shy engineer desperately
        needs venture capital for his virtual wing woman app. Can he and his app
        seduce a heartbroken girl at a swanky LA bar to prove it works?.. A
        modern-day take on Cyrano de Bergerac, APP follows Paul as he
        desperately tries to get venture capital for his sexy wingwoman app from
        a sex-starved investor, Mike. To convince Mike to invest, Paul uses his
        app to seduce a feisty stranger, Zoe. As the App whispers advice, Paul
        becomes a hipster Don Juan and they grow closer through the night. But
        when Paul starts to feel a genuine connection, all his calculations
        become a little more complicated.</image:caption
