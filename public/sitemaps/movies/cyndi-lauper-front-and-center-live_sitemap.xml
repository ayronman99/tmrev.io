        >The release of She’s So Unusual in 1984, catapulted Cyndi Lauper to the
        top of the charts and established her as a household name. She became
        the first woman to record four Top 10 singles on a debut album; “Girls
        Just Want to Have Fun,” “Time After Time,” “All Through the Night” and
        “She-Bop.” With her iconic four-octave voice, Cyndi celebrates the 30th
        Anniversary of the Grammy-winning smash debut album with Front and
        Center. Taped from New York City’s Highline Ballroom, the performance
        marks the first time Lauper has ever performed the album from start to
        finish</image:caption
