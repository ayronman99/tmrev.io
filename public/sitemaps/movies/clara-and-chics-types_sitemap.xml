        >Three days in the lives of six friends who are nearly 30 years old,
        live in Grenoble, and have a rock band called the "Why Notes?". They're
        to play in Paris at Charles's school reunion. In getting to Paris and
        back, the characters interact with Aimee's ex-husband and her abrasive,
        cruel ex-mentor, Louise's would-be lover who turns out to have a
        husband, Mickey's long-time lover and her children, Bertrand's Germanic
        wife and their children who speak no French, and Frederic's distant
        mother. The band also meets Clara, a mercurial free spirit who beguiles
        Bertrand, then Mickey, then takes up with someone else in the
        band.</image:caption
