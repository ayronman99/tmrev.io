        >Sloan Carter is a young girl who has recently been blinded. Her father
        leaves for the weekend and her two best friends, returning home from
        University, keep her company. A protege of her father's, passing through
        town, also spends the night. The peaceful weekend is interrupted by a
        shadowy threat and the safe country getaway turns into a fight for
        survival.</image:caption
