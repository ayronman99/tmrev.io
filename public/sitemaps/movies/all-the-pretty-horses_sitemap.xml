        >The year is 1949. A young Texan named John Grady finds himself without
        a home after his mother sells the ranch where he has spent his entire
        life. Lured south of the border by the romance of cowboy life and the
        promise of a fresh start, Cole and his pal embark on an adventure that
        will test their resilience, define their maturity, and change their
        lives forever.</image:caption
