        >A police officer in the special branch, Bhaskar Chenmai, alias Bachi
        (Jagapathi Babu) one day receives a boy Habibi (Master Teja) from a
        courier from Dubai. Claiming that his mother had told him that Jagapati
        Babu is his father, the boy starts addressing him as father. The
        uncomfortable Bachi tries various methods to get rid of the boy, but his
        ways serve only to get him drawn towards the boy and become friends
        ultimately. Meanwhile, Bachi is the chief security officer for Tatineni
        Koteswara Rao (Prakash Raj), the Rs 50-crore winner of the Paris
        lottery. But Bachi's search for the boy continues and he manages to nail
        the father by his name, Bachi (Pruthvi Raj) and arrests him. But is he
        the real villain of the piece?</image:caption
