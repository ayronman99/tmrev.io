        >"InuNeko" is the story of a very strange love triangle between a
        teacher, her student and the young man they both love. Things get really
        strange, though, when Yuki, the teacher played by former Miniskirt
        Police member Tomomi Miyauchi, switches bodies with Makino, her student
        played by gravure idol Charlotte Yabuki. Toraichi (Masato Uchiyama), the
        young man in the middle of all this isn't quite sure what to make of it
        all... including how Yuki has somehow inherited Makino's hairy
        armpits.</image:caption
