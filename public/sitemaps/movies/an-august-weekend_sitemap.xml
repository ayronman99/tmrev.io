        >Happily married to Thomas, her daughter just off to college, Katja
        teaches math and music at the local elementary school. Her life seems
        perfect. Until a chance encounter turns her world upside down. The very
        weekend her family is away, she meets Daniel, an attractive, inquisitive
        fellow, backpacking through Germany. A travel journalist, just passing
        through, he camps out on her lawn. They connect. She finds his
        independent, freewheeling lifestyle fascinating. He tells her of his
        journeys. He makes her feel alive, reawakens her youthful hopes and
        dreams. Now old regrets come rushing back. After three exciting days,
        she is faced with the decision: does she go with him, or does she stay
        in her own, safe little world?</image:caption
