        >Da-hee gets married to Min-soo who is older than her. Thanks to him, he
        also gets a son who is not too old, Jae-hyuk, who she tries to get
        acquainted with, albeit awkwardly. After staying with Na-yeon, she
        suddenly has to meet Jae-hyuk, and Na-yeon has a date with Jae-hyuk.
        Min-soo is surprised to find three people coming back home from a date.
        It made him angry to see his son with two women. Right away, Min-soo
        seeks Da-hee and asks about Na-yeon. Na-yeon met Min-soo secretly.
        However, Da-hee who is aware of Min-soo and Da-hee's relationship,
        shares this fact to Jae-hyun.</image:caption
