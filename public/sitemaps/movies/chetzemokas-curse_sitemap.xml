        >Chetzemoka's Curse is about a young, twenty-something woman, Maya (Maya
        Berthoud), who is haunted by the memory of her first love and her
        subsequent betrayal. She still feels the pain, works to exorcise it as
        she wiles away her life as a maid in a small town hotel. But her road to
        health seems to include passing the bad karma along. She encourages an
        older married man to run off with her and betray his wife and kids.
        Betrayal is in the air. Even an itinerant street musician sings about
        his infidelity. Bottom line, he says, is that he betrayed
        himself.</image:caption
