        >Lazarus de Jesus is the adopted son of a wealthy lady from Lisbon, whom
        he calls Grandmother. It is she who introduces him to Godfather, a great
        businessman who takes him as his protégé, and Angelina, the woman
        Grandma wants him to marry. But Lazarus has other hidden interests, the
        most important of which is an obsessive fixation on female armpits. When
        he sees the violinist Maria Pia playing, Lazarus immediately falls in
        love and starts to live for her, which will precipitate an absolutely
        unpredictable ending.</image:caption
