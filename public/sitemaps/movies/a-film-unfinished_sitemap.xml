        >Yael Hersonski's powerful documentary achieves a remarkable feat
        through its penetrating look at another film-the now-infamous
        Nazi-produced film about the Warsaw Ghetto. Discovered after the war,
        the unfinished work, with no soundtrack, quickly became a resource for
        historians seeking an authentic record, despite its elaborate
        propagandistic construction. The later discovery of a long-missing reel
        complicated earlier readings, showing the manipulations of camera crews
        in these "everyday" scenes. Well-heeled Jews attending elegant dinners
        and theatricals (while callously stepping over the dead bodies of
        compatriots) now appeared as unwilling, but complicit, actors,
        alternately fearful and in denial of their looming fate.</image:caption
