        >A young man has to go to the hospital for an operation. Upon his
        arrival he watches paramedics roll out a deceased person from the
        hospital room he is about to be checked in to. Lying in bed with nothing
        to do his mind starts to wander. He strikes up a conversation about life
        with an old man who paints a rather dark picture of what can happen
        during oneâ€™s stay in a hospital. The old man shares his ironic
        philosophy on life, causing him great anxiety. Will he make it out
        alive?</image:caption
