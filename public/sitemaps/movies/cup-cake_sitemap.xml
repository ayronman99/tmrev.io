        >P.J`s in a pickle, his parents are missing, he is a spectacular failure
        at running their bakery, 'Cup Cake', and he is up to his neck in debt
        with the local loan-Sharks. To add to his misery, he has been duped into
        marriage by their impossibly tanned and serially jilted sister, Kitty.
        Enter Gala, a mysterious, beautiful artist with a few tricks of her own.
        P.J. , a robot-obsessed dreamer and his hapless friends, aided by the
        ever resourceful Gala, set about cooking up the revival of 'Cup Cake's'
        fortunes, and spicing up P.J`s love life along the way.</image:caption
