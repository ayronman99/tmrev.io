        >Based on the best-selling religious studies book by Joseph Atwill, this
        documentary shows that Jesus is not a historical figure, the events of
        Jesus' life were based on a Roman military campaign, his supposed second
        coming refers to an event that already occurred, and the Gospels were
        written by a family of Caesars who left us documents to prove it.
        Besides Atwill, six other controversial Bible scholars weigh in, showing
        that the teachings of Christ came from the ancient pagan mystery
        schools, and that Christianity was used as a political tool to control
        the masses of the day and is still being used this way
        today.</image:caption
