        >Houses, neat, some pretty, some with children playing in front, collide
        with sounds. Sounds remembered from so long ago, maybe from one of
        Beirut's many wars, maybe even from future wars. In this 6 minute video,
        the street scape of Broken Hill, 'the accessible outback' country town
        of Australia, is seen from the viewing platform of past realities, woven
        into a tapestry of morality, memory and experience. There, exponential
        repetition sets apathy on a collision course with fear and where
        displacement of the senses, synchronicity and loss accelerate at
        vertiginous speed. Mangled silences interrupt, but only to disrupt the
        remnants of illusion and safe living, to send eidetic shock waves
        through rose coloured lenses. The question of responsibility then
        emerges to demand if not an answer, then a pause for grief, for
        consideration due to the boundaries of the senses and the centrality of
        the body's, any-body's, pain and sorrow.</image:caption
