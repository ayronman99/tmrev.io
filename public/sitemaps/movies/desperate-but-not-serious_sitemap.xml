        >Lily is a twenty-something aspiring writer who receives an invitation
        to attend a wedding reception with Jonathan, a handsome entomologist who
        also happens to be the man of her dreams. The only problem is that she's
        in San Francisco and the wedding is in L.A. Lily is therefore forced to
        enlist the aid of her friend Frances, an unrepentant party girl who has
        the L.A. nightclub scene wired. Their plans are completely derailed when
        they inadvertently lose the all important wedding invitation. This sets
        in motion an evening full of near misses with Jonathan, and thrusts Lily
        and Frances into a swarm of offbeat encounters with the underground
        Hollywood crowd. Off they go from club to club, from party to party and
        from boy to boy in an effort to find the wedding
        reception.</image:caption
