        >Tarachime is a documentary film which observes 'life' through
        childbirth. Kawase Naomi, a film director working under the theme of
        family, life and death, presents the bond of life through her own
        childbirth experience. "First, I was planning to film from the day I
        conceived a child and to the moment I gave birth. But I realized, while
        filming, that this is not the story of "one life." In the end, the film
        sublimed to a higher stage on which we can witness the knot tying one
        life with another."</image:caption
