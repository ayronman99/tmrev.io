        >Michael Wolffsen (Tyler Mane) receives an urgent phone call and takes
        his nephew and fiancee and makes the journey home to his only other
        living relative: his estranged, eccentric (and extremely paranoid)
        father, Gary (Muse Watson), who is obsessed with building an
        unassailable compound. Once they arrive at Garyâ€™s modest home,
        surrounded by acres and acres of grounds full of cameras and other
        security sensors, Michael is surprised and concerned to learn that his
        father is in the early stages of dementia. The house is now also covered
        in supernatural and occult symbols. Welcome to the compound, COMPOUND
        FRACTURE. Will the stronghold that was designed to save them be their
        everlasting tomb?</image:caption
