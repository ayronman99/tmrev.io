        >Sir Ian McKellen reads the poetry, Michael Wood traces the journey on
        the ground. Together they conjure up the extraordinary life, times and
        words of Chinaâ€™s greatest poet, Du Fu. In this film, the first to ever
        be made about Du Fu in the west, Michael follows his tracks by road,
        train and riverboat. Along the way, he meets ordinary people, dancers
        and musicians, who help to tell the amazing story of a poet whose words
        have resonated through the centuries, describing the experiences of
        ordinary people caught up in war, corruption, famine and natural
        disasters. "I am one of the privileged. If my life is so bitter, then
        how much worse is the life of the common people?"</image:caption
