        >An aging Irish businessman, an aspiring Australian actress, a retired
        American baseball player and a widowed British bodyguard attempt to
        complete the four most difficult ultra marathon races on Earth-- a goal
        previously only attempted by professional athletes. The four races bring
        them to the world's most picturesque and brutal deserts in Chile, China,
        Egypt and Antarctica, where they will push their bodies, minds and
        spirits to their limits. Desert Runners chronicles the intense,
        year-long journey of these dedicated runners and the many obstacles that
        they face - both expected and unexpected,external and internal - and
        provides an intimate view into the complex ways human beings deal with
        heartbreak and triumph.</image:caption
