        >Alice, a buoyant and impertinent red-hair teenager is far from the
        charming little girl her mother adopted as she was unable to have a
        child of her own. Being an endless source of problems and affected by
        the specter of her motherâ€™s disappointments, Alice acts with her back
        against the wall, forging lies and blurring lines between the fiction
        she designs for herself and the reality of her existence. Until her
        mother discovers she is pregnant.</image:caption
