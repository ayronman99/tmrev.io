        >Sang-min has always been beaten by So-yeon. He is being comforted by
        Min-yeong, the wife of his junior. Was it because of her sympathy for
        Sang-min? The two of them get to sleep. Geun-bae takes a peek at them
        and takes pictures. Geun-bae who liked So-yeon for a long time, always
        tells her that Sang-min cheats on her so he can sex with her.
        Unexpectedly, So-yeon who is in love with Sang-min didn't fall for
        Geun-bae easily.</image:caption
