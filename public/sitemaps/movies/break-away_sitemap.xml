        >Francois is a hard working husband and dad that gets laid off from his
        job. None of his efforts to get another job succeed and he is forced to
        use what he has, including an old bicycle, in order to provide for his
        family. With the help of his "black sheep" brother, a bicycle shop owner
        and a pro-cyclist, Francois makes some life-changing discoveries about
        his life, career and faith in God. Although a fictional story, Break
        Away, was inspired by true events around the recession that left people
        without work. The message brings hope and offers practical and Biblical
        solutions in a very entertaining way.</image:caption
