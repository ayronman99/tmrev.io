        >This is a documentary about the Uruguayan boxer Alfredo Evangelista,
        who at height of his career even fought against Mohammad Ali. A
        considerable part of the film is a long interview with him in
        Carabanchel prison in Madrid. Alfredo, one of Uruguay's last sporting
        legends, tells his story for the camera. He talks about his life and his
        career in sport, and he reflects bitterly and lucidly about the mistakes
        he has made and his situation today.</image:caption
