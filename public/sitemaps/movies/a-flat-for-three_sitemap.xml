        >Ulisse, Fulvio and Domenico decide to rent an apartment together in
        order to live with their modest work. However the three encounter any
        difficulties that have forced them to always be one step away from
        starvation. Ulisse has to maintain his wife and daughter selling
        recordings of important foreign singers, Fulvio has the task of
        reviewing silly scandals of celebrities instead of writing articles for
        major artists, while Domenico must keep his wife and children going to
        make love with old single pensioners.</image:caption
