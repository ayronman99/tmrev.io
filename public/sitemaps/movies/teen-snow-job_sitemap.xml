        >It's three days before one of the biggest dances of the winter, and a
        humongous overnight snowfall means one thing - SNOW DAY! To Ron's
        horror, every teen in town immediately heads to one place - The Mall.
        Jude and Jonesy immediately wreck havoc with their wild stunts and get
        Ron-the-Rentacop on their bad side. Jonesy proceeds to get fired - again
        - but Jude's day off leads him to the opportunity of a lifetime - a
        chance to drive the ice rink's zamboni. Unfortunately he drives it right
        through The Penalty Box and is banned from the mall -
        forever</image:caption
