        >A Backyard in Nowhere is an independent film that mixes Western and
        Gonzo elements with traditional fly fishing Blinded by stories of giant
        Northern pike, a trio of fly fishers set out to explore the remote
        Innoko River in Alaska. They end up getting a whole lot more than they
        bargained for After the fly fishers meet the Native Americans that live
        in the drainage, their adventure begins to take wild twists and turns
        Moving deeper into the Backyard, the fly fishers find some of the best
        pike on the fly fishing ever caught on film. But, to their misfortune,
        the Backyard turns out to be a lot like the old West Generous servings
        of booze, taking the law into one s own hands and gun slinging over a
        piece of land, are challenges that need to be overcome to find the
        giants of the Innoko.</image:caption
