        >Portrait of Costa da Morte (coast region in Galicia, Spain) from an
        ethnographic and landscape level, exploring also the collective
        imagination associated with the area. A region marked by strong oceanic
        feeling dominated by the historical conception of world's end and with
        tragic shipwrecks. Fragmentary film that approaches to the
        anthropological from its protagonists: sailors, shellfish, loggers,
        farmers ... A selection of characters representative of the traditional
        work carried out in the countryside in the region, allowing us to
        reflect on the influence of the environment on people.</image:caption
