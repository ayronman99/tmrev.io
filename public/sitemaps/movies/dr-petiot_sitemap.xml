        >A true story shot in a German Impressionistic style. In France during
        the Nazi occupation, Dr. Petiot (Michel Serrault) offered to help Jews
        escape the Nazis. They would come to his house, and he would kindly give
        them lethal "vaccinations" for their anticipated travel to Argentina.
        Then he would steal everything the brought with them (in addition to
        their up-front payment to him) and burn their bodies in his home-made
        crematorium.</image:caption
