        >A group of friends listen as one man tells them a story about a time
        when, in a small cafe, he discovered a peephole into the ladies'
        bathroom and became addicted to looking through it at female genitals.
        They ask him questions and come to conclusions about sex. This is a
        filmed, scripted version. Then, the actual person who this happened to
        relates the same story; this time, however, it is an unscripted
        documentary, in which the same things occur as in the scripted
        one.</image:caption
