        >Jeff Lucas is already an outcast, but when he makes a horror film
        instead of a documentary for a class project, the ridicule his
        classmates inflict upon him soon turns to outright abuse. After being
        forced into an auto race with one of his more sadistic classmates,
        Jeff's car careens over a cliff and the troubled student is presumed to
        be dead. When a new family moves into the home previously inhabited by
        Jeff and his family, a series of bizarre occurrences lead the family's
        high-school-age son to believe that Jeff has returned to inflict revenge
        upon those who wronged him in life.</image:caption
