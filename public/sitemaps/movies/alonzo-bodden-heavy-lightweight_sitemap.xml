        >In this day and age if it were all heavy it wouldn’t be a comedy
        special, it would be a depression special, and Alonzo Bodden is very
        aware of this. That’s why he goes back and forth, from Heavy to
        Lightweight, because he knows we need a break from news in comedy. He
        likes to mix it up and he hopes you will join him for a laugh and a
        think or two.</image:caption
