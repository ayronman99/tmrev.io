        >The plight of the "one-point-five generation" of over 20,000 Koreans
        who immigrated to Argentina is explored in the debut feature from
        director Bae Youn Suk. Soon after Bo-rum's father's illicit clothing
        factory is raided by the authorities, the displaced worker catches the
        eye of pretty, former co-worker Duk-Kyu. As the pair set out on their
        first date to the tourist hot spot of La Boca, the good time that they
        have together is nevertheless underscored by their relative
        unfamiliarity with the strange surrounding. From the young,
        rabble-rousing Koreans who resent the fast-track success of their more
        industrious fellow countrymen to the second generation that offers hope
        for the future, this is the story of people trying to find a new life as
        their identity as Koreans fade and a new breed emerges to forge ahead
        into an unknown but promising future.</image:caption
