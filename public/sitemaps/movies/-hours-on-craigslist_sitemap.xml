        >24 Hours on Craigslist is a 2005 American feature-length documentary
        that captures the people and stories behind a single day's posts on the
        community-focused, classified website Craigslist. The film, made with
        the approval of Craigslist's founder Craig Newmark, is woven from
        interviews with the site's users, all of whom opted in to be contacted
        by the production when they submitted their posts on August 4, 2003. The
        documentary screened in nine film festivals during 2004 and 2005,
        winning a 'best feature documentary', and played in a limited,
        self-distributed, theatrical release in 2005 and 2006. The film was
        released on DVD on April 25, 2006</image:caption
