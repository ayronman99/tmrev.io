        >Incompatible fugitive recovery agents, the flighty Jersey Bellini
        (Michael Dudikoff) and his more serious-minded female partner, B.B.
        (Lisa Howard), have, for the last time, ticked off mobster Wald (Tony
        Curtis) by apprehending his rather inept henchmen just as they are about
        to commit a robbery or kill one of Wald's enemies. That's when Wald
        turns their fate over to the ruthless Crazy Carlos (Steve Bacic), with
        the intention of having Bellini and B.B. killed. But the hapless bounty
        hunters keep having good luck just when they need it most. ~ Buzz
