        >Chigusa and Yuuto always spent time together as children. They enter
        high school at the same time and happen to be put into the same class.
        Yuuto's mother ran off and his father is an alcoholic, so it seems as
        though the only time he can feel any relief from the pain of his life is
        when he spends time with Chii-chan and can be reminded of the happy
        little moments from his past.</image:caption
