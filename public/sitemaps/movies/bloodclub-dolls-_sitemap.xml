        >Following the news of a heinous tragedy, a young woman searches the
        streets for her missing brother, the person accused of committing the
        incident. Unaware of his true status or location, he finds himself in
        the employ of an underground fighting ring using inmates like him to
        entertain wealthy clients, eventually moving up the ranks of the
        fighters quite quickly. Eventually frustrated at the lack of information
        from the investigation, she turns to a detective to help him, but with a
        dangerous socialite also looking into the club they try to push their
        rescue efforts into high gear into order to save her
        brother.</image:caption
