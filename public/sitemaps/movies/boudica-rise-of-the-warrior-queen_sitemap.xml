        >Boudica is an innocent sixteen-year-old girl who is forced into an
        arranged marriage by her father, the leader of a Celtic Tribe. However,
        her mother is unsure, doing whatever it takes to protect her daughter;
        so much so that she takes Boudica and persuades her to flee the village
        and live in her childhood home, away from an arranged marriage and a
        miserable life.</image:caption
