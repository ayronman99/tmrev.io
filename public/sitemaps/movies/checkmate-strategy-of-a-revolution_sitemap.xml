        >How does one trigger a revolution? In the Romanian uprising in 1989,
        everything seemed to happen by itself. The people were fed up and were
        plagued by poverty and terror. There comes a time when action must be
        taken! But, it turns out that history is not that simple, as this
        investigative documentary proves. The film is a thorough and revealing
        reconstruction of the events leading up to Ceaucescuâ€™s downfall and
        execution. In actual fact, the Romanian revolution was a strictly
        managed operation, controlled from the outside. Hungary, Germany and
        especially America had big fingers in the pie.</image:caption
