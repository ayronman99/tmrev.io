        >Ang Panday 2 begins with Flavio/Panday (Revilla) and Maria settling in
        the peaceful and quiet town of Matandang Kahoy. All is well until
        Lizardo returns and captures Maria. On his quest to save his lady love,
        Flavio crosses paths with Ariana whose father had been killed by
        Lizardo. As the two join forces, Ariana finds herself falling for
        Flavio. All this happens in a magical world filled with dragons, fairies
        and other mythical beings. According to Director Carlo J. Caparas who
        penned the story, the King of Philippine Movies himself, the late
        Fernando Poe Jr., would be impressed with the production of Ang Panday
        2. FPJ had starred in the original Panday films, and had long been
        associated with the beloved Pinoy komiks character.</image:caption
