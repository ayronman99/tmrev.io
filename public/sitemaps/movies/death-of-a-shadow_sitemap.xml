        >Soldier Nathan died during World War I. A strange collector imprisoned
        his shadow and gave him a new chance: a second life against 10000
        captured shadows. It is love that guides him, as his purpose is to meet
        Sarah again, the woman he fell in love with before he died. But then he
        discovers that she's already in love with someone else, jealousy clouds
        his mind and pushes him towards a bitter decision, not without
        consequences.</image:caption
