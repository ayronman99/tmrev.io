        >La Restinga is located in the principal Peruvian Amazonic city,
        Iquitos. It is an association that works supporting endangered children
        and teenagers, such as street working children. Their saint is the
        Shoebox's Jesus Child, represented as a shoebox kid. One important work
        of La Restinga is to organize the children in order them to produce
        videos and reports. Amazonico follows the kids and films the characters
        they present: a disabled man who dances for a living, a gay soccer team,
        the well-known orchestra The Explosion Group, Huerequeque -who was an
        actor in the Werner Herzog`s film Fitzcarraldo-, a story-teller known as
        the Llullampero, and amazonic painters.</image:caption
