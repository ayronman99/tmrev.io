        >If Carol Channing didn't exist, no one could have made her up. One in a
        billion, Carol , at 89, remains an unstoppable, megawatt dynamo.
        Broadway diva extraordinaire is just the icing. Carol Channing hovered
        at the pinnacle of the entertainment world from the late-1950's through
        the 1960's and beyond, living life sensationally large. As Carol has
        observed, '...if you're lucky enough to have two hit shows, the world
        passes through your dressing room'. At 89, she remains
        irrepressible.</image:caption
