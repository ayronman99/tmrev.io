        >When two freshmen pledges are accepted into the biggest party frat on
        campus, they think they have it all. That is, until the assistant dean
        forces the Alphas to share their house with a sorority or face expulsion
        from school. Not wanting to see their lifelong dream of becoming Alphas
        destroyed, the pledges convince the other members of the house to take
        back what's theirs, waging an epic battle of the sexes to fight for
        their right to party.</image:caption
