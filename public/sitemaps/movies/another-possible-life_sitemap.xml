        >A man and a woman meet again after many years - on the territory and
        circumstances of post-socialist Bulgaria. A university graduate and
        poetess, forced to adapt herself to the new social environment, she
        survives in her own country as a tram driver. Having arrived for his
        father's funeral after years of travels abroad, he catches a glimpse of
        his old flame accidentally in a tram. Could they bring back their
        emotional time, the time of their lives? Could they try to resurrect
        whatever bound them together in their youth?</image:caption
