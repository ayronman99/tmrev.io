        >Rachel is a girl, adopted by an upper middle class family, who rebelled
        at 17 and left her family and studies at a traditional college in Sao
        Paulo to become a call girl. Shortly after starting work, she decided to
        write a blog about her experiences. Since some clients thought she
        looked like a surfer she adopted the name "Surfistinha" which means
        little surfer girl.</image:caption
