        >With the untimely passing of frontman Stuart Adamson in 2001, the title
        Final Fling couldn't be more sadly appropriate. This two-disc set
        captures Big Country toward the beginning and near the end of their
        20-year career. The first disc features a 1988 performance from an
        outdoor peace concert in East Berlin, shortly before the release of
        Peace in Our Time (and before the Berlin Wall came down in 1989). It's a
        straightforward, electric set played in front of a huge, enthusiastic
        crowd during the twilight hours. The second disc finds the Scottish
        rockers back at their old stomping grounds, Glasgow's Barrowlands, while
        on their Driving to Damascus tour with the Alarm in 2000. They may look
        older, but their chiming twin-guitar attack is as passionate and rousing
        as ever. Both sets include such fan favorites as "Look Away," "Fields of
        Fire," and Top 40 hit "In a Big Country." --Kathleen C.
