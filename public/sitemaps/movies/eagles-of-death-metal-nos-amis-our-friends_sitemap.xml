        >The November 13, 2015 terrorist attack in Paris claimed 130 lives
        around the city -- 89 of them at the Eagles of Death Metalâ€™s Bataclan
        Theatre concert. "Eagles of Death Metal: Nos Amis (Our Friends)"
        spotlights the American rock band as they recount their experiences
        before and after the tragic events. The film explores the deep bonds
        between band co-founders Jesse Hughes and Josh Homme (also a member of
        Queens of the Stone Age), as well as the intense connection the band has
        always had with its devoted fans, which moved them to return to Paris to
        perform once again in February 2016.</image:caption
