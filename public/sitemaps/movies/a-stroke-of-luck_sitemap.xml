        >Villaviciosa de al Lado is a peaceful town stuck in time, living
        exclusively of the fame of a 200 years-old spa. Therefore, city hall's
        debts threatens to close the spa and ruin all town. Their salvation
        becomes when suddenly mayor Anselmo and the rest of members of city hall
        realize that they won the Christmas Lottery. But their happiness turns
        in horror after to discover that the prize belongs to a serial number
        distributed by the town's brothel, causing the suspicion of the wives
        and fear of the husbands after a TV interview where Mari, brothel's
        owner, claims that the almost men of the town will have prize from the
        lottery. Wanting a way to charge the prize to save the town without
        having to suffer the anger of their respective women, Anselmo, Ricardo,
        CÃ©sar, Juandi and Paco plots a plan in order to steal the money from the
        brothel, meanwhile Mari tries reconcile her stranded life and restore
        the memory of her deceased father, a former mayor.</image:caption
