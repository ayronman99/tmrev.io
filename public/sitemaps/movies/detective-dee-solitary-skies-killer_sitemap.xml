        >Bizarre "husband killing" happened into the wedding day. Four people
        running out from wedding room and shouting "not me", and then raised a
        knife to commit suicide. The process of the crime was watched by the
        guests, but they coincidentally pointed the finger at a weak girl,
        pointing out that she is the culprit behind the scene. Even the young
        girl herself confesses to the crime, revealing that she is a "bad luck
        star" who can't control those close to her. The death of an innocent
        watcher in the woods, the brutal death of a key figure in prison, and a
        mysterious village littered with corpses, all seem to be inextricably
        linked to the tragedy of death.</image:caption
