        >Shivaraj is a rich business man who has no feelings towards
        relationship. Nayana falls for him and joins his company. But he never
        reprocates her. He reveals to her that he hates relations and the word
        'tomorrow' because one day his father said tomorrow he will return but
        never didn't. He learns from Nayana's father that his father
        (Dr.Rajkumar) had dedicated his life for farmers. He also does the same
        and succeeds. But he falls unconscious on his self created 'Farmers
        Day'. He tells that the day he was talking to Nayana he had a small
        accident and discovered that he had cancer which cannot be treated. As
        the film ends, everybody cry including Nayana who says that she knew
        about his cancer.</image:caption
