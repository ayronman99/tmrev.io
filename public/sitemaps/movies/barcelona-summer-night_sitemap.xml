        >In 2012 the comet Rose crossed the skies of the city of Barcelona and
        its magic that night caused 346 love stories flourish. An atmosphere of
        dreams, hopes and desire mixed to give a special connection between
        people. From these stories six are the stars of the film. A dinner among
        friends with a love of life is coupled with a first time for miles. An
        encounter that can change their lives and revive old ties that clash
        with the discovery of a baby on the way. In parallel, the struggle
        between friendship and love strikes the last story, a clandestine love
        between gay athletes who have to make a tough decision.</image:caption
