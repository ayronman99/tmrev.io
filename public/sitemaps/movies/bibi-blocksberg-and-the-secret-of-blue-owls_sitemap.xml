        >Poor Bibi - due to her bad marks in maths she has to spend the whole
        summer in the boarding school of Altenberg to scrape through a series of
        exams - otherwise she'd stay down in school, being forced to repeat the
        year. No camping, no white-water rafting, no vacation at all. So it
        doesn't surprise anyone that the young witch is quite disgruntled when
        arriving at Altenberg Castle. Her roommate is a touchy unpleassant
        fashion victim and headmaster Quirin Bartels is so muddle-headed that he
        can't even remember the names of his students properly. But then Bibi
        makes friends with Elea, a girl wheelchair-bound since a terrible
        accident where she also lost her beloved parents. Now Bibi is determined
        to help the sensitive Elea, searching a way to heal her from her palsy
        legs.</image:caption
