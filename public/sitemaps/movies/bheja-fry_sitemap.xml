        >Ranjeet Thadani (Rajat Kapoor), a bored, arrogant music company
        executive hurts his back the night he has found a prize catch for a
        weekly bring - your -idiot talent dinner hosted by his friends and him.
        He ends up spending the evening with this idiot, Bharat Bhushan (Vinay
        Pathak) who tries to help him get his wife (Sarika) back who left him
        earlier that day. The result is utter chaos let loose by the idiot, who
        cannot do a single thing without messing it up further. The plot turns
        around to be a series of mini disasters that leave Ranjeet's comfortable
        life in ruins. Call it the idiot's revenge!</image:caption
