        >The great media prankster, Joey Skaggs, wants to fool the world media
        AGAIN, and, with the most complex hoax of his career in the pipeline, he
        now must use every trick in his prankster's arsenal to make it work. Art
        of the Prank is an emotional journey following the evolution of artist
        Joey Skaggs-a fierce proponent of independent thinking and the man who
        has turned the media hoax into an art form. With unprecedented access to
        the man and his archives, the 95-minute documentary interweaves a
        current unfolding hoax with a look behind-the-scenes at some classic
        performance pieces (all reported as fact by a wide range of prestigious
        journalists) plus commentary from co-conspirators and others.
