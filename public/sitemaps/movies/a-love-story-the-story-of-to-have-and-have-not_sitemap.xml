        >In the '40s Howard Hawks boasts that he can make a movie out of the
        worst thing Hemingway ever has written. When Hemingway asks, which novel
        he means, Hawks says To Have and Have Not. Jules Furthman writes a
        script, which follows the book closely. The location of the story is
        Cuba, but the US Government is against depicting corruption and violence
        on Cuba, and threatens to withdraw the film's export license. William
        Faulkner rewrites the script, and relocates the story to Martinique.
        Hawks's wife, Nancy Slim Gross, happens to see a young model at the
        cover of the magazine Harper's Bazaar, and shows it to her husband.
        Hawks is a star-maker, who likes to discover and nurture new talents.
        After a screen test, he chooses the 19-year-old model as the lead
        actress opposite Humphrey Bogart. She changes her name from Betty Perske
        to Lauren Bacall. At the first takes she is so nervous that she
        shakes.</image:caption
