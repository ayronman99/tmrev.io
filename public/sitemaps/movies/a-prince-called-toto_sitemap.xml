        >Tot√≤, the mythical comedian of Italian stage and screen, was the
        illegitimate child of a noble man in one of Naples's poorest
        neighborhoods. As a child, he enlisted in the army simply to eat three
        square meals a day. Later, his dizzying success in show business brought
        him riches he had never dreamed of, plus stories of love and jealousy,
        the most important being with 16 year old Diana who eventually became
        his wife, only to leave him and inspire the Italian classic torch song
        Malafemmina, meaning bad woman.</image:caption
