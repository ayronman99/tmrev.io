        >Ruurd Walrecht`s interest of historical crops began when he was very
        young. He started a life long crusade to protect, preserve and maintain
        them. This Dutch Don Quichote of rare vegetables built an incredible
        collection of hundreds of crops that were on the brink of extinction.
        Suddenly, Ruurd moved to Sweden leaving his colourful mix of helpers
        behind. They tell the story of this master horticulturist and his Green
        Ark. Because his life work is very important to all of
        us.</image:caption
