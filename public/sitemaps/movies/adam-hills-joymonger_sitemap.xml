        >Adam's positive energetic comedy and rampant spontaneity have seen him
        collect rave reviews, and a legion of fans across Australia, Great
        Britain, Ireland and Europe. He has not surprisingly bagged a swag of
        awards in recent years including a Helpmann Award in 2007, and been
        nominated three times for the prestigious Perrier Award at the Edinburgh
        Fringe Festival. "Joymonger" delivers one of Adam's most acclaimed
        shows, recorded live with AUSLAN interpreter Leanne Beer at Melbourne's
        Athenaeum Theatre. "Hills delivers stand up so effortlessly brilliant
        you wonder why some comedians even get out of bed" The Guardian, London
        "If you cannot enjoy Adam Hills you cannot have a pulse. Four Stars" The
        Scotsman "Hills's wit is incisively dry and sharp and his observations
        are bitingly precise" Sunday Herald Sun</image:caption
