        >A high school teacher, Masato Saito, is told by his best friend, police
        officer Shinya Saito, about a strange murder case. The incident was that
        a woman broke through her belly and had an umbilical cord popping out of
        her belly, and at the same time three men were said to have blew bubbles
        from their mouths and died. One day, Shinya's wife, Junko, receives
        something called Baby Mail. The baby mail says, "I have a grudge against
        someone who is trying to have a child. I will raise my child." When she
        opens the attached file "@", the baby cried and the LCD of her cell
        phone cracked, which was creepy. A month later, she was found in a
        condition similar to the bizarre incident. However, she was diagnosed as
        four months pregnant when her body was found, even though she had her
        period a month ago.</image:caption
