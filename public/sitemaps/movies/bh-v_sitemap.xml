        >About one faulty circuit breaker and about a man who only found out
        after death that he had not lived well. František Souček is an
        electrician who is killed by an electric current during a routine
        switchboard repair. In spite of everything, he returns home and finds
        that everyone suspiciously ignores him... After František's death, much
        has changed: his daughter Iveta is dating the pervert Igor from the
        neighborhood, his son Vašek has adopted as his surrogate father the
        judoka Vincent, who has become the lover of his wife Líba... only an
        encounter with God in heaven can save everything...</image:caption
