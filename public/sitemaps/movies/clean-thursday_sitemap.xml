        >Not far from Grozny, on an alternate railroad track, there is an old
        steam locomotive with several wagons attached to it. The steam engine
        gives steam — hot water is in the boilers, and a bathhouse is equipped
        in the cars, where soldiers and officers wash, laundry is washed ... A
        washing on wheels — at the same time a soldier’s bivouac, a piece of
        peaceful life, and the beginning of a new road. To this locomotive,
        these cars come - platooned, in batches and one at a time - tired,
        tired, unshaven, angry Russian guys. They scrape dirt off themselves.
        Soak from stubborn soot, warm with souls. They put on clean underwear.
        They drink vodka. They smoke. They talk about love, remember loved ones
        and native places. Cry. They sing. And around - the landscape after the
        battle. It's not over yet ... An accidental explosion. Stray bullet. And
        our guys washed into the unknown. Clean. Hoping to
        survive.</image:caption
