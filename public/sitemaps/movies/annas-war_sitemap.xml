        >The entire family of a 6-year-old Anna dies in the mass coordinated
        execution of Jews. The mother covers up Anna with her own body, and the
        girl miraculously survives. For the next few hundred days Anna hides in
        the disused chimney at the Nazi Commandant's office. From her shelter
        she watches as life passes her by until the village is liberated from
        the Nazi. In these inhuman conditions Anna not only survives but keeps
        her humanity. Many factors help her: memories from the life swept away
        by war, the cultural foundations laid by the parents and a friend who
        saves her from loneliness.</image:caption
