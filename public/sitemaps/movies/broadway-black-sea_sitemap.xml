        >Refugees from the Caucasian republics, Armenians, Azerbaijanis and
        Russians, meet on the shore of the Black Sea: they work as shop keepers,
        life guards, karaoke singers, or just enjoy their holidays. It all
        happens at a place called Broadway, which is no-where to be found on a
        map, not even the most detailed ones. The temporary inhabitants of
        Broadway construct a whole world en miniature, consisting of small
        carts, tents or booths parked in close, haphazard rows. The scenery,
        which is put up for a few weeks during the summer, bubbles with life â€“
        and in no way corresponds with ordinary daily life in
        Russia.</image:caption
