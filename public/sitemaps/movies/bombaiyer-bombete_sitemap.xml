        >Lalmohan Ganguly, alias Jatayu − a sidekick of Feluda − gets invited to
        Mumbai (previously Bombay) to watch the shooting of a film based on a
        novel written by him. Once in Mumbai, he, along with Feluda and Topshe
        gets embroiled with underworld kingpins. He seems to have transported
        the Nana Sahib's necklace. But fortunately because of Feluda the real
        thief is caught and convicted. Although the original story was written
        in the 1970s, the movie is set in more recent times and depict the real
        problem of underworld involvement in Bollywood.</image:caption
