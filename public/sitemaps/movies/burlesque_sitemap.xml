        >The Burlesque Lounge has its best days behind it. Tess, a retired
        dancer and owner of the venue, struggles to keep the aging theater
        alive, facing all kinds of financial and artistic challenges. With the
        Lounge's troupe members becoming increasingly distracted by personal
        problems and a threat coming from a wealthy businessman's quest to buy
        the spot from Tess, the good fortune seems to have abandoned the club
        altogether. Meanwhile, the life of Ali, a small-town girl from Iowa, is
        about to change dramatically. Hired by Tess as a waitress at the Lounge,
        Ali escapes a hollow past and quickly falls in love with the art of
        burlesque. Backed by newfound friends amongst the theater's crew, she
        manages to fulfill her dreams of being on stage herself. Things take a
        dramatic turn though when Ali's big voice makes her become the main
        attraction of the venue.</image:caption
