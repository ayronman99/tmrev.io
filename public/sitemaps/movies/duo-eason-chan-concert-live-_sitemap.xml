        >Eason Chan recently held his biggest-scale concert series to date with
        18 concerts at the Hong Kong Coliseum between March and April 2010,
        breaking his personal record. The critically acclaimed and highly
        popular Canto-pop superstar handed in his all in the DUO concerts, which
        saw him perform various sets of songs with a similar motif chosen from
        his own repertoire as well as those of other artists. He brought his
        unique style to favorites like Faye Wong's "Promise", Roman Tam's "Good
        Song Dedicated to You", Sandy Lam's "Dawn", Tat Ming Pair's "Forbidden
        Lust", Kay Tse's "Street of Wedding Invitations", and Japanese song Mr.
        Lonely originally by Tamaki Koji</image:caption
