        >The day before Soo-min’s big concert day, her college friends Won-ho,
        Sun-ki, Hong, and Jin-sook gather to celebrate Soo-min. Talking about
        their old memories and having fun seems like a happy moment of old
        friends. But soon when Soo-min leaves to the bathroom, Jin-sook starts a
        disturbing story about Soo-min that she has been sexually abused by her
        dad and brother after her mom’s death. As all friends are shocked, one
        by one starts to talk about Soo-min’s whole secrets as if they know
        everything about her without knowing Soo-min is overhearing their
        conversation. It drives Soo-min to the irrevocable revenge with secrets
        behind.</image:caption
