        >'A New Beginning' focuses around the story of Leung, the bodyguard of a
        Chinese Triad boss, Wong, to whom his loyalty is unrivaled. Living in
        Hong Kong, Wong requests that his bodyguard travel to the UK to protect
        a young British woman, whose true identity is known only by Wong
        himself. Even his own errant son, Yuen, is kept in the dark, which leads
        to a betrayal that threatens to destroy the family and all that his
        father has worked hard to protect.</image:caption
