        >A young girl zealously wants to go to school and learn to read and
        write. Almost everywhere she is met with hostility or indifference. The
        only young boy who takes her to his school is thrown out by the teacher,
        because helping her prevented him from arriving in time. On her way home
        she and other girls are taken as prisoners by boys playing as Taliban
        fighters. They tear her school book to pieces and threaten to stone
        their female captives.</image:caption
