        >Three teenagers are confined to an isolated country estate that could
        very well be on another planet. The trio spend their days listening to
        endless homemade tapes that teach them a whole new vocabulary. Any word
        that comes from beyond their family abode is instantly assigned a new
        meaning. Hence 'the sea' refers to a large armchair and 'zombies' are
        little yellow flowers. Having invented a brother whom they claim to have
        ostracized for his disobedience, the uber-controlling parents terrorize
        their offspring into submission.</image:caption
