        >Uprooted from Los Angeles after her mother is stricken with breast
        cancer, thirteen year old Fen struggles to adjust to life in Taipei. As
        Fen navigates her way through school and reconnects with her
        long-separated father, her turbulent bond with her mother worsens. Fen
        drifts further away from her mother through a series of rebellious acts
        before her younger sister is misdiagnosed with SARS, pushing Fen and her
        mother towards a heated, long-gestating confrontation.</image:caption
