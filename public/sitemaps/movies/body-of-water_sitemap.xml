        >Julia is a young lawyer who has been in conflict with her father for a
        long time. Her mother seems a bit insane, and Julia thinks that he is
        partially responsible for this. She has also split with the father of
        her son and tries to escape all these concerns by working hard. On a new
        case, she is brought back to the house near the lake where she was
        raised to help a group of environmentalists to protect its natural
        beauty against the industrial project of a power company. But by doing
        so she has to fight the greed of the locals, and their trust in an evil
        spirit that is believed to be attached to the lake.</image:caption
