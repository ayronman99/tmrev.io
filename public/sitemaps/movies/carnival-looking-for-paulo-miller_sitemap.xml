        >A 2008 short made in accompaniment with Our Beloved Month of August,
        documenting Gomes's and his crew's hapless search, during 2007's
        carnival, for one of Arganil's most storied and elusive characters (who
        does, in fact, ultimately appear as an interviewee/player in the
        finished film). Paulo "Miller" is known for taking a dangerous jump into
        the Alva from a bridge each year during carnival, but what this film is
        about is, in keeping with the free-roving feature, much less the subject
        himself than Gomes and co.'s inability to pin him down; not only does he
        not do his famous jump during this year's carnival, but an ostensible
        technical/audio failure (as with the feature, it's very difficult to say
        how much of this film is "fact," how much invented) during Gomes's
        initial on-camera meeting with Paulo "Miller" leads to five minutes of
        lip-readers attempting to decipher their conversation.</image:caption
