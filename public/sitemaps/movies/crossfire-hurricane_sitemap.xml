        >This film is released as part of the ongoing 50th anniversary
        celebration of the Rolling Stones. It tells the story of the Stones'
        unparalleled journey from blues obsessed teens in the early 60s to their
        undisputed status as rock royalty. All of the Stones have been newly
        interviewed and their words form the narrative arc that links together
        archive footage of performances, news coverage, and interviews, much of
        it previously unseen. Taking its title from a lyric in "Jumpin' Jack
        Flash," this film gives the viewer an intimate insight into exactly what
        it's like to be part of the Rolling Stones as they overcome
        denunciation, drugs, dissensions, and death to become the definitive
        survivors. Over a year in the making and produced with the full
        cooperation and involvement of the Stones, this film is and will remain
        the definitive story of the world's greatest rock 'n' roll
        band</image:caption
