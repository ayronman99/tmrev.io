        >One thousand years after cataclysmic events forced humanity's escape
        from Earth, Nova Prime has become mankind's new home. Legendary General
        Cypher Raige returns from an extended tour of duty to his estranged
        family, ready to be a father to his 13-year-old son, Kitai. When an
        asteroid storm damages Cypher and Kitai's craft, they crash-land on a
        now unfamiliar and dangerous Earth. As his father lies dying in the
        cockpit, Kitai must trek across the hostile terrain to recover their
        rescue beacon. His whole life, Kitai has wanted nothing more than to be
        a soldier like his father. Today, he gets his chance.</image:caption
