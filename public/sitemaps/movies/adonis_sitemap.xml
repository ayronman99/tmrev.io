        >Yang Ke, a Beijing Opera actor, is fatefully driven into the underworld
        of masculine sex workers, and becomes a class of his own. He finds
        himself on a roller coaster between heavenly love with both men and
        women, and a living hell ensnared by devious villains and hypocrites.
        Despite his faith, endeavor and willingness to give, he remains a
        prisoner to his karma. Hell awaits when heaven seems near, and the
        ultimate truth is revealed only in a heartbreaking moment from which
        there is no return.</image:caption
