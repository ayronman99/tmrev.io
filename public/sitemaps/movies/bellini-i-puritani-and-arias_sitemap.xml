        >First off this is a live broadcast from 1966, Trieste. The picture is a
        nice black and white, and sound is in digital and DTS and is good. As
        for the cast, D'Angelo is very touching as Elvira, she is more of the
        stand and deliver singer of the old school, but that is not distracking
        for myself. She is a colortura soprano with a light sound, she was a
        student of Toti dal Monte and had a span at the MET from 1961 to 1968,
        where she shared productions with singers like Sutherland, Scotto, and
        Peters. If you like your belcanto with plenty of high notes (plenty of
        high d's and e's)you will enjoy her performance. Her mad scene (only
        slightly cut) is a high point in the performance as are all the scenes
        she's in. The rest of the cast is good and the Arturo Luciano Saldari
        sings well minus a high note or two. The main drawback here is the score
        is cut by over 40 mins. I am guessing that is was the tradition of the
        time. Overall a nice vintage performance.</image:caption
