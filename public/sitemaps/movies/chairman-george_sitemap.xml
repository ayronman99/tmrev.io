        CHAIRMAN GEORGE is a documentary feature about a Greek-Canadian
        troubadour who refuses to live anything but an extraordinary life. ln
        Ottawa, George is a statistician who lives with his mother. But every
        few months, he takes an extended leave from his job and heads to China
        where he metamorphoses into an international man of culture. Armed only
        with his bouzouki, guitar and cell phone, he becomes a star in China
        (with both the critics and the ladies). He concludes that since he is
        "the only Greek in the world who can sing in Chinese," it is his duty to
        perform at the Closing Ceremonies of the Athens Olympic Games, as the
        torch is passed from Athens to Beijing.</image:caption
