        >The story of the water fluoridation controversy which has arisen from
        moral, ethical, political and safety concerns regarding the fluoridation
        of public water supplies. The controversy occurs mainly in
        English-speaking countries, as Continental Europe does not practice
        water fluoridation. Instead, fluoride is added to most table salt in
        Europe. Those opposed argue that water fluoridation imposes ethical
        issues, may cause serious health problems, is not effective enough to
        justify the costs, and has a dosage that cannot be precisely
        controlled.</image:caption
