        >In 2000, VH-1 produced the television biopic Daydream Believers: The
        Monkees' Story. In 2002, the movie was released on DVD, and featured
        both commentaries and interviews with Dolenz, Jones and Tork. The aired
        version did differ from the DVD release as the TV version had an
        extended scene with all four Monkees but with a shortened Cleveland
        concert segment. It was also available on VHS.</image:caption
