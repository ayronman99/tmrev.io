        >After the cataclysmic events in New York with The Avengers, Steve
        Rogers, aka Captain America is living quietly in Washington, D.C. and
        trying to adjust to the modern world. But when a S.H.I.E.L.D. colleague
        comes under attack, Steve becomes embroiled in a web of intrigue that
        threatens to put the world at risk. Joining forces with the Black Widow,
        Captain America struggles to expose the ever-widening conspiracy while
        fighting off professional assassins sent to silence him at every turn.
        When the full scope of the villainous plot is revealed, Captain America
        and the Black Widow enlist the help of a new ally, the Falcon. However,
        they soon find themselves up against an unexpected and formidable
        enemyâ€”the Winter Soldier.</image:caption
