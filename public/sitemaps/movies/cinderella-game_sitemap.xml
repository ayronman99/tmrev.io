        >Sana Haitani (Kasumi Yamaya) is a member of an idol group. She's
        following the dreams of her now deceased older sister who always wanted
        to become a top idol. Unfortunately, Sana's idol group is disbanded. She
        is then kidnapped and taken to an uninhabited island. What awaits for
        her is a card battle. If she wins in the card battle against other
        kidnapped idol girls, she can become a top idol. But, if Sana loses ...
        she will die.</image:caption
