        >After twenty years of broken bottles and empty hallways, Mort Gleason
        witnesses his nephew Moo being beaten while in a drunken stupor. The
        short contact with family brings Mort back to what are left of his
        senses and he returns to the last home he remembers in Chicago. His
        sister Eileen lives in their family home now with her sixteen year old
        son, Abe. Her older son Moo, the now missing nephew, helped spark Mort's
        return to his family. Three, four, five weeks pass as Mort waits outside
        his home and makes a tenuous re-entry into family life. Abe dreams of a
        sailboat and distant horizons. He saves money and sees an advertisement
        for the Kathy II. He and his friend calculate a way to buy the vessel
        from two unscrupulous rogues who make ends meet wholesaling liquor and
        operating a sometime boatyard.</image:caption
