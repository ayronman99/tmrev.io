        >Three stories, one day in EDSA. An opportunistic entrepreneur develops
        a bond with a street kid trying to help him get to his business meeting
        in Makati, after losing his cellphone to a snatcher. A teacher from the
        province haggles with a former OFW, turned taxi driver, whether the
        country should follow world standards in basic education requirements.
        And a snatcher trying to reform himself with the help of a nurse by
        trying to return what he stole. Three stories all asking the same thing:
        what matters most, the collective or the individual gain?</image:caption
