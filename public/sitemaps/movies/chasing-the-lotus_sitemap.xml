        >For forty years, underground film-makers Greg Weaver and Spyder Wills
        documented surf discovery as it migrated around the world. Their shots
        captured on celluloid became the images for such films as Stylemasters,
        The Forgotten Island of Santosha, Big Wednesday, Pacific Vibrations,
        Uluwatu and many more. This documentary is a cinematic journey inspired
        by many of the reels that were lost in the making of these films. Since
        that time, these reels have resurfaced and are now brought to light. A
        fusion of rare super 8mm film, photo stills and contemporary interviews
        blend together to make Chasing the Lotus the most in-depth look at the
        evolution of the surf culture and surf discovery ever
        made.</image:caption
