        >When society breaks down due to a violent outbreak that turns victims
        into undead monsters, a former elite soldier breaks out of jail to find
        his family. Against the odds, he fights against hordes of undead, hoping
        to finally reunite with his wife and daughter. But he also discovers
        that in a world of hunger, uncertainty, and desperation, the living can
        be just as dangerous as the undead.</image:caption
