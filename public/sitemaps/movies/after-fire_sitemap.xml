        >Set in the military outpost of San Antonio, Texas, AFTER FIRE
        highlights the challenges faced by the fastest-growing group of American
        veterans: women, who now account for one in five new recruits to the
        U.S. Armed Forces. Demonstrating courage during their military service
        and resilience in its aftermath, three women military veterans candidly
        confront the fallout of their experiences on their personal lives as
        they adjust to the civilian world. The film throws a spotlight on the
        human toll of military service - including military sexual trauma,
        combat injuries and bureaucratic dysfunction - telling a universal story
        about strength in the aftermath of trauma.</image:caption
