        >Vietnam veteran Leon Barlow is struggling as a writer, and his personal
        life isn't much better. His unsympathetic ex-wife Marilyn doesn't
        approve of his visits with his two children, and he has problems with
        alcohol. Yet even when Leon manages to catch up on alimony and child
        support payments, things in his life seem to decline further, until a
        sudden tragedy catches him off guard.</image:caption
