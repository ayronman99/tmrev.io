        >In an interview at age 84, Chuck Jones (1912-2000) talks about his
        life, particularly his childhood: he describes an adventurous uncle; his
        mother, who never said no; his father, a critical and abusive man who
        had his uses; Chuck's going to art school and studying the human body;
        success as an animator; and, old age. As he talks, we also see clips
        from his work, we watch him draw, and simple animation illustrates parts
        of his story. He talks about growing up on Sunset Boulevard, going to
        the beach, his enjoyment of Mark Twain, his mother's loving creativity,
        the connection of his personality to some of his cartoon characters, and
        the joy of being alive.</image:caption
