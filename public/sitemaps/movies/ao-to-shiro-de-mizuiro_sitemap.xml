        >Uchiyama Kaede and Shiina Kasumi used to be best friends. Now in high
        school, Kasumi grew more popular than Kaede, which has led her to
        continually bully her ex-best friend. One day after school, Kaede meets
        Kishida Takumi, a bike thief who's especially talented in picking locks.
        She asks him for a favour: if he could possibly open the key to the
        school roof. Meanwhile, the arrival of a new teacher seems to bring
        changes to the school.</image:caption
