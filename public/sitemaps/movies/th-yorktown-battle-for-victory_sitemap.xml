        >Celebrates the 225th anniversary re-enactment of America's momentous
        1781 Revolutionary War victory at Yorktown, Virginia. The four-day
        commemorative event was held October 19-22, 2006, with many of the
        events staged on the original field. Four different battle re-enactments
        feature re-enactors from around the world portraying Continental
        Soldiers, American Militia and Riflemen, German Hessians, British
        Regulars, the French Army in America as well as cavalry, artillery,
        camps, 18th century women and sutlers. Cameras are "embedded" with these
        soldiers on the field of battle and in their camps, carrying the viewer
        on this journey to final victory in the American
        Revolution.</image:caption
