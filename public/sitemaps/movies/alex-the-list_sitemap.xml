        >Alex, a lovable, unassuming dog trainer is in love with a great woman -
        Katherine - smart, talented, from a good family. Katherine adores Alex's
        quirky sense of humor, honesty and capacity to listen. Having decided to
        pop the question, Alex is blindsided when Katherine produces a detailed
        list of well-thought-out "improvements" she feels will tweak Alex on
        their way to becoming the ideal couple. Alex instinctively rejects the
        suggestion that he needs to change anything. But with the threat of a
        new competitor, Alex decides to "do the list." Guided by a coterie of
        friends that include: Dave, Alex's loyal childhood buddy, best female
        friend Lily, her husband Michael, and their 8 year old son, Nicky,
        Alex's journey has him reconsider and question his beliefs, values and
        world.</image:caption
