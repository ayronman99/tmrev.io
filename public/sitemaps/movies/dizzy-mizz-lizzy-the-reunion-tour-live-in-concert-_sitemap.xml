        >Live in Concert 2010 is a 19-song live recording of two concerts at the
        K.B. Hallen on 16â€“17 April 2010, by the Danish power rock band Dizzy
        Mizz Lizzy. On September 15, 2009, the band announced the Danish Dizzy
        Mizz Lizzy reunion tour taking place in Spring 2010 with concerts in
        Odense, Aarhus (2 shows), Aalborg, Esbjerg (2 shows) and Copenhagen (4
        shows). The idea was spawned while Christensen, Nielsen and Friis went
        bowling, which they often did when meeting up. Dizzy Mizz Lizzy were
        overwhelmed when the tour's first show on 9 April at the K.B. Hallen had
        sold out in less than 15 seconds on 20 September 2009, and less than 45
        seconds for the other shows. They realized the demand for their shows
        was far greater than expected. The band subsequently expanded the tour
        to a total of 52 dates, making this one of the most successful comebacks
        in the history of Danish music.</image:caption
