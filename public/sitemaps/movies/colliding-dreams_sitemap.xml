        >We live at a moment in time when the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, now
        more than a century old, continues to be of overwhelming international
        political and societal importance. From its inception, that conflict has
        also, of course, had powerful and deeply troubling consequences for
        Israelis and Palestinians themselves. The story at its most basic level
        is one that involves two peoples struggling for national recognition and
        expression in a small but richly significant piece of land. The tragedy
        of this history, as both the Israeli novelist, Amos Oz, and the
        Palestinian scholar, Sari Nusseibeh, have each pointed out, stems from a
        conflict between the rights of two peoples with equal and legitimate
        aspirations to nationhood and self-expression in a single small
        territory to which they can both lay claim.</image:caption
