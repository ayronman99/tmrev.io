        >Harry Gordini is on his way to Italy for a holiday with his family. On
        his way he accidentally picks up the wrong suitcase which holds in it
        hundreds of millions worth of new superdrug. Now the drugdealers want
        the drugs back and kidnap Harry's wife and son. But unfortunately Harry
        isn't just anyone, he's an ex-Navy SEAL and veteran of the Gulf war,
        code named "Wolverine". He successfully rescues his wife and kid from
        the drugdealers, but unfortunately their problems aren't yet over.
        Adolfo Jones, the head of the crime organisation, is still at large, and
        he's being helped by couple of dirty DEA-agents. Once again the
        drugdealer Jones is able to kidnap his son. So everything must come down
        to a final showdown between the "Wolverine" and Jones...</image:caption
