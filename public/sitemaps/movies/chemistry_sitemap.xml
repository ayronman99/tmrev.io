        >Three girl students are found to have committed suicide in a boarding
        school in Alwaye under mysterious circumstances. Their boyfriends are
        interrogated by the cops, and one of them, Ananthu goes into depression.
        He happens to be the boyfriend of one of the dead girls, Gowri. The case
        remains unresolved. A year later, investigating officer Sreekanth's
        niece Parvati joins the school , and is given the same room where Gowri
        used to stay. Soon Parvati starts acting weird, which is noted by her
        classmates, and even the school driver and peon start to also see Gowri
        appearing at night in the school corridors. Gowri's spirit soon appears
        before Parvati, seeking her help. At times, it also gets into Parvati,
        making her act possessed. It is then known that Gowri and her two
        friends were very happy go lucky characters in the school, and something
        happens during a picnic which changes their lives
        forever.</image:caption
