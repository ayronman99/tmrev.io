        >Two men who were "best friends" while growing up together and into
        their 20's, reconnect after years apart. On the surface, their lives
        have gone in opposite directions, one married, successful, respectful
        and settled; the other divorced, footloose, unemployed and prowling. The
        narrative is not linear but vertical as simple get together to "have a
        drink" leads to a nihilistic descent into macho hell. The only thing
        that survives their reunion is their love for one
        another.</image:caption
