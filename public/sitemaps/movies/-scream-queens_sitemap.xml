        >Alexis, Sylvia and Ellen are a trio of legendary scream queens. After
        the head of a motion picture studio invites them out to a very special
        screening in exchange for the possibility of a lead role in an upcoming
        horror film, the three women slowly become suspicious... not only of
        their circumstances, but also each other. They begin to realize that the
        horrific footage they are watching might be real and that they might be
        trapped in the deserted studio with a bonafide killer.</image:caption
