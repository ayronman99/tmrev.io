        >In the distant technological future, civilization has reached its
        ultimate Net-based form. An "infection" in the past caused the automated
        systems to spiral out of order, resulting in a multi-leveled city
        structure that replicates itself infinitely in all directions. Now
        humanity has lost access to the city's controls, and is hunted down and
        purged by the defense system known as the Safeguard. In a tiny corner of
        the city, a little enclave known as the Electro-Fishers is facing
        eventual extinction, trapped between the threat of the Safeguard and
        dwindling food supplies. A girl named Zuru goes on a journey to find
        food for her village, only to inadvertently cause doom when an
        observation tower senses her and summons a Safeguard pack to eliminate
        the threat. With her companions dead and all escape routes blocked, the
        only thing that can save her now is the sudden arrival of Killy the
        Wanderer, on his quest for the Net Terminal Genes, the key to restoring
        order to the world.</image:caption
