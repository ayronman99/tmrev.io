        >Anandibai Joshi, the First Indian woman who went against all odds to
        get herself educated and became a doctor to set an example and inspired
        generations to come. In times, when gender equality and feminism are
        raised at almost every forum and podium, a couple in the 1800's
        practiced and fought for these very ideas. Anandi Gopal is a love story
        more than a biopic about the struggle of a husband to teach his wife and
        her response and determination to become the first Indian Female
        Doctor.</image:caption
