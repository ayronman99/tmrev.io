        >A small group of artists travels the Brazilian backlands presenting a
        show. Upon arriving in a small village, they find an abandoned city with
        houses, a church, and a fountain spouting clean water, like a miracle of
        a biblical desert. Tired of and battered by their life as wanderers, the
        artists decide to settle in the village and start a new community,
        assigning themselves different roles from those they have played
        throughout their lives. This new arrangement, however, will reveal these
        artists the worst vices of the civilian life.</image:caption
