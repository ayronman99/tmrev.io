        >Daft Punk Unchained is the first film about the pop culture phenomenon
        that is Daft Punk, the duo with 12 million albums sold worldwide and
        seven Grammy Awards. Throughout their career Thomas Bangalter and
        Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo have always resisted compromise and the
        established codes of show business. They have remained determined to
        maintain control of every link in the chain of their creative process.
        In the era of globalisation and social networks, they rarely speak in
        public and neither do they show their faces on TV. This documentary
        explores this unprecedented cultural revolution revealing a duo of
        artists on a permanent quest for creativity, independence and
        freedom.</image:caption
