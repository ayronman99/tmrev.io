        >An impressionistic experimental drama. A woman walks a fine line
        between sanity and madness in a world of constant twilight. She works at
        a filling station and lives a life of emotional isolation. No one seems
        to pay attention to her, and she lives in a run-down flat that looks as
        if it's decaying before our eyes. As the woman wrestles with the demons
        that are taking hold within her mind, she frequently confronts herself
        in the mirror, often while naked.</image:caption
