        >A sweet girl learns to let the nasty side of her personality come out
        in this erotic drama for adults only. Karen is a nice young woman who
        works at a bookstore. However, Karen is a bit too nice for the tastes of
        her boyfriend Keith, who has a rougher idea of a good time than she
        does. Karen tries to convince Keith she's not a stick-in-the --mud by
        tagging along for a night out with his buddies, but when that doesn't do
        well, she turns to some bone-fide "bad girls" for advice on living on
        the wild side.</image:caption
