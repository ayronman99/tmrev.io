        >Dead Horse Point is a film that expresses my feelings of ambivalence
        for the western genre, and America as a nation. It is the fourth part in
        a series of North American landscape films that I have been shooting
        since 2003. It essentially deals with the notion of "the old west," "the
        frontier," the blurred line between historical fact and myth, the role
        of Hollywood in the historical process, the importance of celebrity in
        America, and finally the influence that the western landscape has had in
        defining the mythology of "the old west." Jason Britski</image:caption
