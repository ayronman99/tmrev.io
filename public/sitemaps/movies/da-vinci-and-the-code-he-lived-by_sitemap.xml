        >Renowned as the "Mind of the Renaissance," the genius of Leonardo da
        Vinci reaches beyond the centuries. Painter, sculptor, engineer, and
        scientist, in each field Leonardo da Vinci was both master and pioneer.
        Creator of some of the world's great artistic masterpieces, such as the
        Last Supper and the Mona Lisa, he was also a visionary whose fantastic
        inventions would become reality only hundreds of years after his death.
        Follow the original Renaissance man through glittering palaces of
        merchant princes, accusations of blasphemy, and whispers of betrayal and
        romance--all to satisfy a limitless desire for knowledge. From the
        producers of Islam: Empire of Faith and Barbarians, and available on DVD
        for the first time ever, DA VINCI AND THE CODE HE LIVED BY tells the
        remarkable story of one man's boundless talent, his towering legacy, and
        his courage in the face of powerful adversity.</image:caption
