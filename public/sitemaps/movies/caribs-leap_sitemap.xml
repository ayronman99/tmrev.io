        >Caribsâ€™ Leap / Western Deep comprises two complementary films that are
        shown together as a three-screen, synchronised colour video projection.
        The films were originally commissioned for the Documenta 11 exhibition
        in Kassel, Germany in 2002. They were then screened in London by
        Artangel in the former Lumiere Cinema on St Martins Lane in the autumn
        of that same year.</image:caption
