        >In 1824, John McGee, an English adventurer, arrived in the Soconusco
        area of Chiapas with his young wife. There, they sought to fulfill their
        dream of prosperity and become the first producers of coffee. Upon
        reaching Chiapas, they discovered that the state had seceded from the
        rule of Guatemala, plunging into an interim and anarchic government that
        lasted for 18 years. During this time, John saw his dream frustrated and
        was forced to seek refuge at his own farm under the protection of the
        clergy. The dowry of his daughter Isabel becomes his last chance to make
        his dream come true, as he negotiates with Geronimo and Julian, sellers
        of coffee plants and slaves, respectively. In the midst of the beauty
        and hostility of the jungle, a story of love and betrayal emerges,
        framing the arrival of coffee to Chiapas.</image:caption
