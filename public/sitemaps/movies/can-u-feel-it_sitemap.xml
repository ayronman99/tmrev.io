        >CAN U FEEL IT is the experience of UMF on the big screen. It's a
        feature length film about a new generation seen through the eyes of the
        world's greatest DJ's. TiÃ«sto, David Guetta, Carl Cox, Afrojack, Fedde
        le Grand, Boys Noize will be the headlining superstars that will take
        you on an electrifying journey through UMF and the world of dance music.
        The film makes you feel like you are on the dance floor and in the DJ
        booth at the same time and has the pace and feel of a music video mixed
        with in-depth storylines on the artists, the event and especially the
        rise of dance music around the world. UMF is the world's premiere
        electronic music festival. It is like the Olympics for electronic dance
        music (EDM) and every year during Miami Music Week all the major EDM
        artists and fans from around the world collide in Miami for this
        ultimate experience in dance music.</image:caption
