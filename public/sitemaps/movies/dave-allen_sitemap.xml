        >Dave Allen was an alternative comedian before the phrase even existed.
        He was an innovator who set the agenda for comedy and comedians for more
        than thirty years. All he needed was a stool and a glass of something
        and he was in his element, reflecting laconically on such subjects as
        sex, the Irish and God, traffic, smoking, the Bible, Life and Death.
        Also sex, the Irish and God... This DVD contains his very own personal
        choice of sketches, gags and monologues. It's a vintage display from a
        unique raconteur - a man who observes out guilt, weaknesses and doubts
        and makes us laugh at them and at ourselves.</image:caption
