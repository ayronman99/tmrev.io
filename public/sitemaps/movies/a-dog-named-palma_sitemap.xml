        >The film is inspired by an incredible story of a shepherd dog named
        Palm who was inadvertently left in the airport by her owner. She
        befriends nine-year old Nicholas whose mother dies leaving him with a
        father he barely knows - a pilot who finds the dog at the airport. It's
        a story of amazing adventures, true friendship and unconditional
        love.</image:caption
