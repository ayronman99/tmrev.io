        >In a countryside town called Mulgeun lives a bohemian man named BAE
        Joong-dal. His goals in life are to get his younger brother BAE
        Joong-bum, now in his fifties, married and to thrive with his new
        start-up ostrich farm. Living nest door is a pain-in-the-neck named CHO
        Jin-bong who breaks apart the fence to the ostrich farm, resulting in a
        scuffle. Suddenly a beautiful and graceful woman - which is hard to find
        in Mulgeun - unexpectedly shows up in town. Her appearance starts to
        stir up troubles among the residents. Joong-bum, meanwhile, never
        appreciates his brotherâ€™s efforts to set him up on dates. One day after
        running away from a panned date, he returns home drunk late at night and
        confesses something shocking to his brother...</image:caption
