        >Dear Sidewalk tells the story of Gardner, a 24 year old mail-carrier,
        who is struggling to contend with his identity as his quarter-life
        crisis is in full swing. His regimented routine is thrown out the window
        when he meets Paige, a divorcee, enduring a mid-life crisis of her own.
        In this relationship there exists a synchronicity, as they find, despite
        their age difference, they're both confronting existential problems
        surrounding identity, love, and the choices in front of
        them.</image:caption
