        >American Aloha: Hula Beyond Hawaiâ€™i shows the survival of the hula as a
        renaissance continues to grow beyond the islands. With the cost of
        living in Hawai'i estimated at 27 percent higher than the continental
        United States, large numbers of Hawaiians have left the islands to
        pursue professional and educational opportunities. Today, with more
        Native Hawaiians living on the mainland than in the state of Hawai'i,
        the hula has traveled with them. From the suburbs of Los Angeles to the
        San Francisco Bay Area, the largest Hawaiian communities have settled in
        California, and the hula continues to connect communities to their
        heritage on distant shores.</image:caption
