        >In Basin of Tears, two videos are projected side by side on two
        adjacent screens mounted to the wall. This video diptych creates an
        incredible imagery, colours and the sensual quality of water are
        presented vividly, just like in an old master painting. Viewers find
        themselves in a transcendental atmosphere; through the slow pace, the
        large but still intimate size and the exclusion of any sound, Viola
        creates a truly fascinating artwork with a powerful visual effect. It
        seeks to engage the viewer in a visceral and emotional experience that
        goes to the roots of the human condition and its spiritual
        sources.</image:caption
