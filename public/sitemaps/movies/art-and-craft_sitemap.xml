        >For several decades, gifted and incredibly prolific forger Mark Landis
        compulsively created impeccable copies of works by a variety of major
        artists, donating them to institutions across the country and landing
        pieces on many of their walls. ART AND CRAFT brings us into the

        finds his foil in an equally obsessive art registrar.</image:caption
