        >"Ceija Stojka" is a portrait of 64-year-old Austrian Rom Ceija Stojka,
        who, after a nomadic childhood, settled in Vienna many years ago. In the
        recent past, Ceija Stojka’s fame as an author, painter and singer has
        spread outside Austria. She represents the opening of Rom and Sinti
        society to the world of the "gadje." This process and all the
        difficulties it involves is unique in the history of the Rom in Central
        Europe. The central theme of this documentary is the fusion of two
        extremely different worlds in this fascinating woman. Beginning with
        Ceija Stojka’s present life, her biography is reconstructed in this film
        portrait. At the same time, a critical chronology of images portrays the
        common associations with the "gypsy," examples of which pervade Ceija
        Stojka’s life. A comprehensive consideration of the gypsy’s image, from
        romanticized projections to images of exclusion, discrimination and
        destruction, and finally the present ambivalent relationship between Rom
        and non-Rom.</image:caption
