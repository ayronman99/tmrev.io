        >For Miranda Wells, moving to New York to live in Dragonwyck Manor with
        her rich cousin, Nicholas, seems like a dream. However, the situation
        gradually becomes nightmarish. She observes Nicholas' troubled
        relationship with his tenant farmers, as well as with his daughter, to
        whom Miranda serves as governess. Her relationship with Nicholas
        intensifies after his wife dies, but his mental imbalance threatens any
        hope of happiness.</image:caption
