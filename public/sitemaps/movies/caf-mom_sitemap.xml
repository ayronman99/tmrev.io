        >What does the coffee shop mom want to talk about .. ? ' Just because I
        work in a coffee shop doesn't mean I didn't really fall in love. I also
        had love, and I broke up because I fell in love. I also tried to raise
        his child as hard as my child , although it is not my child .. But at
        some point , the child and I had more time .. He gradually neglected the
        house .. It turned out that he was in contact with his ex and again . It
        seemed to be going well If only I disappeared .. Everyone was happy ....
        If I was quiet .. For the one who would become a wonderful husband who
        waited for his wife .. I left ' Why did my son come to visit me ? '
        Nostalgia for a real mother and a place where you want to lean on
        unstable youth</image:caption
