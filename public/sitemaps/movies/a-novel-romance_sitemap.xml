        >Romance novelist Liam Bradley (Dylan Bruce) has already found massive
        success with three books written under the pen name Gabriel August, but
        he's mysteriously unknown to his legions of readers. With his first book
        written as a way to heal after a broken relationship, Liam has slowly
        become disheartened with writing strictly for romantic fantasy,
        something evident to a sweet, but honest, journalist who reviews books,
        Sophie Atkinson (Amy Acker), whom he meets by chance on a plane. The two
        begin a tentative relationship in Sophie’s home town of Portland,
        Oregon, where Liam has come to find inspiration for his newest entry.
        Liam’s agent puts him on the spot with a long-planned reveal of Gabriel
        August’s true identity, but Sophie doesn’t know of his public persona.
        The longer Liam avoids telling her the truth, the deeper a hole he digs
        for himself. Will their romance survive once his true identity comes to
        light?</image:caption
