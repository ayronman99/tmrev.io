        >Rafael (Pierre Andre) is an actor who doesn’t believe in ghosts. One
        day, he’s offered the lead role in a horror movie and is very excited to
        carry it but fails to get into the groove due to his beliefs. He travels
        to many apparently haunted places but sees nothing that will help him
        act the part. His girlfriend Qiss (Fathia) tells her mother about
        Rafael’s plight and finally she reveals to him what “hijab” is. It is
        said that Rafael will finally “see”, if his “hijab” is
        open.</image:caption
