        >High school sucks. In 2012, 17 year old Sophie Harvey suffered trauma
        by a clueless school administration solely because she was an introvert.
        Comedy-as-therapy - IGTHS - is a farcical improv movie about the
        inherent bias against introverts. Created by an inclusive, diverse cast
        and crew, led by a team of women and non-binary department heads, IGTHS
        was made by and for people who care about changing how we treat
        misunderstood youth. Seven years in the making. Creative contributions
        from introverts all over the internet. Sophie still doesn't want to talk
        about it.</image:caption
