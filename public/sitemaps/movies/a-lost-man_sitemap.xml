        >Inspired by the photographic travels of Antione d'Agata, Danielle
        Arbid's worldly drama follows a French photographer who travels the
        globe to seek out the most extreme experiences imaginable. Thomas is a
        fearless shutterbug who's always willing to put his life on the line for
        the sake of a good shot. Upon falling under the spell of an enigmatic
        old man named Fouad Saleh, the photographer travels to the Far East in
        hopes of uncovering the secrets of the man who can no longer recall his
        own past. As the photographer soon finds out, it's often the most
        innocent endeavors that yield the most profound and transformative
        results.</image:caption
