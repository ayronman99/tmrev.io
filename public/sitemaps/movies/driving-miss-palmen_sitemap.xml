        >Set in the merging worlds of Dutch culture and showbiz, Driving Miss
        Palmen includes among its cast of characters former Stedelijk director
        Rudi Fuchs, novelist Connie Palmen, former model Daphne Deckers, and
        Tracey Emin; all were played by visibly nonplussed Bollywood actors.
        Focusing on Palmen, Deckers, and Emin as women who turn their lives into
        a kind of reality TV, Driving Miss Palmen uses the displaced mannerisms
        of Bollywood acting and staging rather like strategies of Brechtian
        alienation.</image:caption
