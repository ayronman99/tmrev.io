        >In August 2010, French filmmaker Vincent Moon and Efterklang's 8
        piece-live band met up on an island off the Danish coast. The objective
        was to shoot a film. A film with the same length as an album, and a film
        full of performances, experiments and collaborations. Over an intense
        period of 4 days Efterklang collaborated with more than 200 local
        musicians, kids and their own parents, creating new performances and
        interpretations of songs from their album Magic Chairs (4AD, Rumraket
        2010). It was all filmed by Vincent Moon who same time conducted several
        filmic and musical experiments with Efterklang as his dedicated
        playmates.</image:caption
