        >Chandram (Srikanth) is a cab driver and a honest man. His wife is
        Kalyani (Meera Jasmine). They are a childless couple. When Kalyani gets
        tested positive for pregnancy, the doc tells him that she needs to be
        operated to avoid complications. The operation would cost around 8 lacs.
        Being a middle class man, Chandram doesn't have that much money. That is
        when he comes across an accident on railway track where the body of an
        unidentified woman is found. He also finds a bag with lots of money
        beside the corpse. his friend advise him to tell the cops that the dead
        woman is his wife. He gets the postmortem done and manages the cops and
        doctor. He finds out that the dead girl is Ramya (Sada). Parents of
        Ramya come to know about it and ask chandram to do the final rites as
        they thought that he is her husband (she elopes from house with her
        boyfriend). The story takes turn when Ramya returns at the time of last
        rites.</image:caption
