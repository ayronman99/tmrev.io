        >Dave, an artist who has yet to complete anything significant in his
        career, builds a fort in his living room out of pure frustration, only
        to wind up trapped by the fantastical pitfalls, booby traps, and
        critters of his own creation. Ignoring his warnings, Daveâ€™s girlfriend
        Annie leads a band of oddball explorers on a rescue mission. Once
        inside, they find themselves trapped in an ever-changing supernatural
        world, threatened by booby traps and pursued by a bloodthirsty
        Minotaur.</image:caption
