        >A 53-year-old widow believes she's turned into the wrong person in this
        bittersweet tale based on Anne Tyler's best-seller. Beck's (Blythe
        Danner) plate is full: She runs a catering business and cares for her
        large family, but feels lost inside. Determined to find herself, Beck
        embarks on a journey, starting with her ex-beau (Peter Fonda) and ending
        with an unexpected soul mate. Jack Palance, Peter Riegert, Faye Dunaway
        and Ione Skye also star.</image:caption
