        >Marty Cutter and LaDon Love are a couple of conniving slackers who earn
        their living "dumping" girlfriends of confrontation challenged men. When
        Jerry Skinner shows up at their door to hire "Booty Boot" to help
        extract him from his main squeeze, Marty and LaDon figure he's just
        another easy mark and money machine. They even train Jerry to perform
        the "dump" himself. Piece of cake. Except they weren't counting on
        encountering Jerry's lady, Lisa Klinger. No matter how much they coach
        Jerry in the fine art of "the dump", he keeps failing. Miserably. None
        of Booty Boot's usual sure-fire techniques and tactics are doing the
        trick--somehow Lisa manages to fend them off and frustrate their
        efforts.</image:caption
