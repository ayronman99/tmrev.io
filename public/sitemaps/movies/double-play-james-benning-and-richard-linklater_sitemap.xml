        >In 1985, former oil rig worker Richard Linklater began a film screening
        society in Austin, Texas, that aimed to show classic art-house and
        experimental films to a budding community of cinephiles. Eventually
        incorporating as a nonprofit, the newly branded Austin Film Society
        raised enough money to fly in their first out-of-town filmmaker: James
        Benning. Accepting the invitation, Benning met Linklater and the two
        began to develop a personal and intellectual bond, leading to many
        future encounters. Starting in the 1960s, Benning had been creating low
        budget films mostly on his own, while Linklater had just begun to craft
        his first shorts. The filmmakers have remained close even as their
        careers have diverged. After the cult success of Slacker, Linklater went
        on to make films with Hollywood support. Benning, meanwhile, has stayed
        close to his roots and is mainly an unknown figure in mainstream film
        culture.</image:caption
