        >In this tribute to the old time spaghetti westerns with a liberal dose
        of modern Hong Kong film-making thrown in, Emilio Estevez assumes Clint
        Eastwood's "man with no name" role. Estevez plays a super-quick gunman
        on the run from a rancher (Long) and his men out to kill him for killing
        his son. The gunman gets mixed up with a former Confederate soldier
        (William Forsythe) who has knowledge of hidden gold. The only trouble is
        he is also pursued by Union soldiers. When they free a man (Ed Lauter)
        with part of the map to the gold, they then are also pursued by Spanish
        soldiers. It all leads to a small Mexican town terrorized by soldiers
        and led a by a good priest (Joaquim De Almeida) who also has knowledge
        of the gold.</image:caption
