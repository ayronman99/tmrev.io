        >Three Canadian Holocaust survivors, with unanswered questions from
        their past, journey back to hometowns, killing sites, and hiding places
        in search of clues in this new film. Maxwell wonders what happened to a
        baby he saved in a forest in 1943. Helen wants to know more about the
        fate of her brother. Rose wants to honour her mother and father by going
        to the places where they spent their final days. The survivors who
        appear in this film came of age during the Holocaust and carry the
        burden of knowing they are the last living link to it. This film
        delivers a powerful warning from history, inspiring stories of survival,
        and a last chance to solve lingering mysteries (88 minutes, English,
        2019).</image:caption
