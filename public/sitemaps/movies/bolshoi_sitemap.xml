        >Young and extremely talented dancer Yulya Olshanskaya from a small
        mining town draws a “happy ticket”: she is noticed by a former ballet
        dancer Pototsky and he promises her a future of great ballerina, worthy
        of the main stage of the country. However, in order to become a diamond,
        anyone, even the most outstanding brilliant, needs to be cut, and the
        way to the legendary stage of The Bolshoi Theatre for Yulya lies through
        the walls of the ballet school, where the more capricious teacher Galina
        Mikhailovna Beletskaya takes custody of the rebellious provincial.
        Turning into a prima will require incredible self-denial, and Yulya
        herself will have to make sure that the big ballet is not only the
        whiteness of the packs, the gold of the boxes and the slip of silk
        ribbons. But no obstacles will stop the one who has the big
        dream.</image:caption
