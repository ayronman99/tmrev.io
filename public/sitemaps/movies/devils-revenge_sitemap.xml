        >John Brock is a down-on-his-luck archaeologist who returns from an
        expedition to the caves of rural Kentucky after unsuccessfully trying to
        locate a mysterious relic that his family has sought for generations.
        Upon his return, John starts to see dream-like visions of a ferocious
        bird-like creature from ancient folklore. John soon learns that the cave
        he came into contact with on his last expedition was indeed the cave
        that contains the relic and also a portal to Hell and a place of worship
        for the Occult. John discovers that the only way to stop the
        increasingly realistic visions is to go back to the cave with his
        family, find the relic once and for all, and destroy it.</image:caption
