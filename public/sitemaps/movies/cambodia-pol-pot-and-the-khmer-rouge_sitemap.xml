        >Between April, 1975 and January, 1979, Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge were
        responsible for the deaths of 1.7 million people in Cambodia. A quarter
        of the population were wiped out in one of the most brutal and virulent
        genocides of the twentieth century. This new film explores the life of
        Pol Pot, the ever-smiling, obsessively secretive leader of the Khmer
        Rouge. What drove him to inflict such a radical experiment on his own
        people? How did the Khmer Rouge turn from a band of nationalist
        revolutionaries into a ruthless killing machine? And why did the West
        stand by and let it happen? As an international tribunal in Cambodia
        finally brings the surviving leaders of the Khmer Rouge to justice, it's
        time to re-examine the gruesome legacy of Pol Pot.</image:caption
