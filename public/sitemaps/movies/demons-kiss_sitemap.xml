        >While on an exploratory research trip into the jungles of South
        America, the beautiful Teresa Burns in bitten by a strange creature.
        Upon returning home Teresa starts to change - she is more aggressive,
        with heightened senses and an uncontrollable passion. The mysterious
        bite has inflicted her with the lust of a wild woman and the killer kiss
        of a demon. Teresa's boyfriend Paul is detained as the prime suspect of
        several mysterious murders. He informs the police about his girlfriend's
        strange behavior since their return and that it is she who is
        responsible for the murders. As Teresa's passion grows stronger, so does
        her bloodlust. Soon the demons within her take over, pushing her to the
        edge of sanity.</image:caption
