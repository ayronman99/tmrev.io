        >Based on the horror game Ao Oni by noprops. Five members of the
        cultural anthropology club at an old western-style school are trying to
        come up with ideas for their presentation at the school's culture
        festival, when they find a collection of folk tales gathered by a
        student in their club 40 years ago. They realize that the mysterious
        Bellflower Oni that appears in the folk tales may be the basis for the
        popular free game Ao Oni, and decide to make that their theme. They
        manage to make contact with the author of the Ao Oni game, but he dies
        mysteriously soon afterward. The club members become suspicious at the
        author's death and began to investigate on their own, but encounter a
        secret they never should have touched: a secret underground prison in
        the school. For some reason all the fire doors at the school are locked,
        and they are trapped in the school. The sound of the strange footsteps
        they hear soon turn to their screams...A new tragedy of the Ao Oni is
        about to begin.</image:caption
