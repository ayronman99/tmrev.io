        >Giulio, a divorced middle-aged man, returns to the family villa in
        Tuscany where he spent his childhood holidays with his entire family, to
        arrange, with his brothers and cousins, for its sale. The house brings
        back memories of his youth and of the beautiful Anna, whom all her
        brothers pursued--but he was the one who ultimately won her over.
        Overcome with emotions, and now aware of the significance of the
        property, Giulio decides to buy all his relatives' shares and move back
        to the villa with his family.</image:caption
