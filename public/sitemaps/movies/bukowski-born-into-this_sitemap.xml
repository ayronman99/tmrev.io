        >Director John Dullaghan’s biographical documentary about infamous poet
        Charles Bukowski, Bukowski: Born Into This, is as much a touching
        portrait of the author as it is an exposé of his sordid lifestyle.
        Interspersed between ample vintage footage of Bukowski’s poetry readings
        are interviews with the poet’s fans including such legendary figures
        such as Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Joyce Fante (wife of John), Bono, and
        Harry Dean Stanton. Filmed in grainy black and white by Bukowski’s
        friend, Taylor Hackford, due to lack of funding, the old films edited
        into this movie paint Bukowski’s life of boozing and brawling
        romantically, securing Bukowski’s legendary status.</image:caption
