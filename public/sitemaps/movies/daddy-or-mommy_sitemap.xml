        >Florence and Vincent Leroy are a model couple. They have great jobs, a
        perfect marriage and delightful children. And now they want their
        divorce to be an equal success. But when they are both simultaneously
        promoted to their dream jobs, their relationship becomes a nightmare.
        From that moment on, the gloves are off, the two exes declare war and
        will do everything in their power to NOT have custody of their
        children.</image:caption
