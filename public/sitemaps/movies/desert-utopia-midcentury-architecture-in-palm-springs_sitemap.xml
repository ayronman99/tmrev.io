        >Southern California’s Coachella Valley, including the communities of
        Palm Springs, Palm Desert, Desert Hot Springs, boasts hundreds of
        extraordinary midcentury modern homes, public buildings and commercial
        structures. Modern designers such as William F. Cody, Albert Frey,
        William Krisel, John Lautner, Richard Neutra, R.M. Schindler, Donald
        Wexler, E. Stewart Williams left their collective mark on this desert
        paradise. Desert Utopia: Mid-Century Architecture in Palm Springs traces
        the history of modern architecture in Palm Springs from the first bold
        forays into modernist design to the preservation challenges facing the
        region today. Director Jake Gorst’s film features rare archival images
        and footage as well as interviews with historians, homeowners and the
        architects who helped create this mecca of modernism.</image:caption
