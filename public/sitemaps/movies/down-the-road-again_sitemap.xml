        >In 1970, Joey and Pete left Nova Scotia to try life in the big city in
        the Canadian Classic Goinâ€™ Down the Road. Now, some forty years later,
        Joey has died, and Pete must fulfill his last wish: to take his ashes
        back to Cape Breton Island, as well as a few other tasks along the way.
        Armed with a series of letters and an envelope full of money, Pete heads
        back home. DOWN THE ROAD AGAIN is a touching, comedic and romantic tale
        of second chances at life and love.</image:caption
