        >It's been one year since Markus freed the androids of Detroit. The most
        advanced android ever created, Nines, has evolved past his initial
        programming as a ruthless hunter, and now protects the city as a DPD
        detective. But as new crimes and dangers start to threaten RK900
        himself, he must also juggle his growing fondness for his partner,
        Detective Gavin Reed, and navigate everything that they mean to one
        another.</image:caption
