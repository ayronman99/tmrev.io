        >Yuki is a sought-after hooker, who also has a special ability: she can
        see ghosts! Yuki is very distraught by the ghost images, and it starts
        affecting her performance at work. One of the ghosts makes an attempt to
        communicate with her and ask her for help. Yuki tries to find out what
        he's attempting to say and assist him, with the hopes that this will
        allow her to stop being troubled by what she sees.</image:caption
