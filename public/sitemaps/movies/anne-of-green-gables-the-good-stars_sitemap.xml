        >When Anne Shirley turns 13, she faces complex issues with her friends,
        inspirational adults and Marilla and Matthew. At the same time, she
        begins a friendship with Gilbert Blythe that emotionally escalates to
        disrupt the status quo of her peaceful world. Her free-spirited nature
        is challenged by her perceived need to become sensible, and her journey
        toward this goal is fraught with confusion and more than a few
        unfortunate â€“ albeit, amusing - mishaps.</image:caption
