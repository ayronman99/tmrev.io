        >With the news of his passing flooding newspaper headlines, and millions
        of fans paying tribute to him on social media, David Bowie's departure
        has left a mark on many all over the world. Known as a musical
        chameleon, Bowie was able to flow and adapt his music and style to
        current fashion and trends. Prior to his breakthrough in 1972, he
        recorded a proto-metal record and a pop/rock album, eventually
        redefining glam rock with his ambiguously sexy Ziggy Stardust persona.
        Ziggy made Bowie an international star, yet he wasn't content with
        gleaming mere glitter rock. Each one of his phases in the '70s sparked a
        number of subgenres, including punk, new wave, goth rock, the new
        romantics, and electronica. Few rock heroes ever had such lasting
        impact. With just two days after his 69th birthday and the uncannily
        timed release of his most poignant album ‘Blackstar’, he left his fans
        with a parting gift that will solidify his already indelible mark in
        music history.</image:caption
