        >In a land plagued by war, the greatest battle humankind has ever known
        is about to be fought. In what is now the Middle East, a section of
        desert that was deemed cursed, is home to the greatest archaeological
        find of all time; "The Wall of Tartarus" an ancient temple which
        predates all known civilizations. This temple holds a very deadly
        secret. It is the doorway to Hell. This is where the fate of mankind
        will be decided. The Hades bunker houses a group of archaeologists led
        by the world-renowned Dr. Angelo Scara, his daughter Annie and Dr. Tony
        Spencer who have unknowingly brought the catalyst for the fall of Heaven
        and Earth into play. They possess the "Eye of Satan" a frightening
        amulet that has an incredible power. This amulet can give Satan and his
        minions the ability to roam the realms between Heaven and Earth
        freely.</image:caption
