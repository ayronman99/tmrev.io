        >In this sequel to the award-winning You’ve Been Trumped, director
        Anthony Baxter once again follows American billionaire Donald Trump and
        a cast of other greedy characters who want to turn some of the Earth’s
        most precious places into golf courses and playgrounds for the super
        rich. From the historic site of Dubrovnik to the ancient sand dunes and
        rolling green hills of the seaside town of Balmedie, these tycoons bully
        local residents, influence governments, ignore local referendums and
        even meddle in national environmental policies to acquire their latest
        trophies. With in-depth interviews and Baxter’s expert storytelling, we
        learn just how devastating these golf courses can be to the surrounding
        countryside and water tables. In this funny, inspiring and at times
        heartbreaking David and Goliath story for the 21st century, the locals
        don’t give in easily. But will their fight be enough to protect their
        land and traditional way of life?</image:caption
