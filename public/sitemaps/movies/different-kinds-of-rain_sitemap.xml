        >The door has been closed for many weeks. A teenager has locked himself
        in - shutting out a helpless father, mother and sister. In Japan, youths
        like him have already been given a name: Hikikomori (the secluded). The
        phenomenon is also beginning to spread throughout the Western world.
        This is all the family has been able to find out. All they can do is
        stand in front of the locked door and ask, beg, implore, throw tantrums,
        despair, accuse, ignore and hope. All the while, the door increasingly
        becomes a mirror of their own lives.</image:caption
