        >In an idyllic Stockholm suburb, 11-year-old Lillebror Str√∂m lives with
        his mum, dad, sister and grandma. When Alex, his sister, introduces her
        new boyfriend to the family, only Lillebror and his best pal Jens get
        suspicious. Is Slim Trim really that nice, and what's the deal with
        those shady friends of his? Meanwhile Lillebror's daddy Roland has
        financial troubles. Roland works at the Toy Museum, which is host to a
        gold exhibition. When the greatest gold heist in national history is
        exposed, Roland's in trouble, being the only one with access to the
        secret information about the museum's security system. Lillebror and
        Jens have to do something.</image:caption
