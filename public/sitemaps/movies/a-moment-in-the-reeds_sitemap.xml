        >Having moved to Paris for university, Leevi returns to his native
        Finland for the summer to help his estranged father renovate the family
        lake house so it can be sold. Tareq, a recent asylum seeker from Syria,
        has been hired to help with the work, and when Leevi's father has to
        return to town on business, the two young men establish a connection and
        embark on a romance set against the idyllic Finnish summer. However,
        looming over this chance encounter, is the father's imminent return to
        the lake house, the continuation of Leevi's studies abroad as well as
        Tareq's complex relationship with his family in Syria.</image:caption
