        >Big Dreams Little Tokyo is the story of Boyd, an American with an
        uncanny ability to speak Japanese. Boyd aspires to succeed in the world
        of Japanese business but finds himself mostly on the outside looking in.
        Meanwhile, his roommate Jerome, is a Japanese American who has always
        felt too American to be Japanese but too Japanese to be American. He
        aspires to be a sumo wrestler but finds his weight and blood pressure
        are thwarting his dreams. Together they struggle to find their place in
        a world where cultural identity is seldom what it seems.</image:caption
