        >At night, the main character in a bride's dress shakes off the voices
        of restraint and is driven to a cliff. And then she fell... When she
        wakes up, a stranger who claims to be her lover appears in front of the
        protagonist. The main character is confused because he can't regain his
        memory. But he knew he was in love with him. And she entrusts herself to
        the intense caress from the man.</image:caption
