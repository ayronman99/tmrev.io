        >Two minutes long, melange-style experimental art film originally shot
        in Super 8 film on location in Andorra la Vella, the 4620-foot high
        capital of Andorra, in the middle of the Pyrenees Mountains between
        France and Spain. The rapid waters of the Valira River flow through the
        capital and are included in the footage, along with a gesticulating
        traffic policeman, mannequins, a dog, a light, and a magical fence post.
        Music and sounds for soundtrack by Oregon-based musician Philip Harris.
        Cwik's films have been shown in festivals in Oregon and West Virginia
        and are represented by the Film-makers Cooperative, New
        York.</image:caption
