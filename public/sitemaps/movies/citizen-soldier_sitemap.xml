        >CITIZEN SOLDIER is a dramatic feature film, told from the point of view
        of a group of Soldiers in the Oklahoma Army National Guard's 45th
        Infantry Brigade Combat Team, known since World War II as the
        "Thunderbirds.‚Äù Set in one of the most dangerous parts of Afghanistan at
        the height of the surge, it is a heart-pounding, heartfelt grunts'
        eye-view of the war. A modern day Band of Brothers, Citizen Soldier
        tells the true story of a group of young Soldiers and their
        life-changing tour of duty in Afghanistan, offering an excruciatingly
        personal look into modern warfare, brotherhood, and patriotism. Using
        real footage from multiple cameras, including helmet cams, these Citizen
        Soldiers give the audience an intimate view into the chaos and horrors
        of combat and, in the process, display their bravery and valor under the
        most hellish of conditions.</image:caption
