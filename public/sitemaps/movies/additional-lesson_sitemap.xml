        >During the next duty, patrolman Vera Sedova single-handedly prevents a
        tragedy at the college, but a student dies in the process. She claims
        that the guy had a sawed-off gun, however, no weapons were found. The
        policewoman is cursed by her parents and the public. The only one who
        becomes humanly sorry for Vera is the appointed lawyer Ilya Nesterov.
        Ilya is more and more immersed in the case and is convinced that his
        client may be right.</image:caption
