        >The video is a 15-minute series of interviews by teens of gay elders
        about their experiences growing up in the 1950s and how they created,
        formed and nurtured a gay community during a time when gay lives were
        underground and hidden. Stories include Hadley, an ROTC member who was
        outed and summarily discharged; Ron, an academic who gave up a promising
        relationship to pursue an education; and Phyllis Lyon, on her
        experiences founding the first lesbian organization in the
        US.</image:caption
