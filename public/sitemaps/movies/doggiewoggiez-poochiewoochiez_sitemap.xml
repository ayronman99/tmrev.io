        >Those krazed VHS-hunting pupz from Everything Is Terrible! (everyone’s
        favorite found footage chop shoppe) are back with their third
        inner-eye-opening feature, containing a feat never before attempted in
        either human or canine history. EIT! asks but two simple questions,
        “What if we make a movie composed ENTIRELY out of dog-related found
        footage?” and ‘'What if this magickal movie, made up of thousands of
        other dog movies, is also a remake of Alejandro Jodorowsky’s 1973
        masterpiece The Holy Mountain?” Well, let’s stop asking dumb rhetorical
        questions because this never-ending spiral of World-Pup winning,
        sunglasses-wearing, murder-solving, skateboarding pooches is real! No
        Bonez about it, this is it! Are you dog enough to go fetch it?
        ARFFFFFF!</image:caption
