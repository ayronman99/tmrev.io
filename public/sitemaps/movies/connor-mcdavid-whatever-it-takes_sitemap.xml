        >Connor McDavid: Whatever it Takes follows the most physically and
        emotionally challenging offseason of Connor McDavid's career. This
        documentary is the remarkable comeback story of one of the NHL's best
        players after what could have been a career ending or altering injury. A
        world-class medical team led by Mark Lindsay, supervised McDavid's
        gruelling rehabilitation program which combined advanced sport science
        and imaging techniques with Connor's sheer will to overcome, allowing
        him to return to the Edmonton Oilers lineup for the 2019-20 home opener.
        McDavid not only came back, but is faster and stronger than ever and
        having the best season of his young career. McDavid enters the 2020
        All-Star break leading the NHL in scoring, and has his Edmonton Oilers
        in the hunt for 1st Place in the Pacific Division.</image:caption
