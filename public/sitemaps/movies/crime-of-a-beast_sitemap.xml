        >Assigned to track and apprehend a serial rapist, Inspector Wong (Chan
        Kwok-bong) tries to question the latest victim, psychiatrist /
        screenwriter (!) Mazy Hui (UN BAISER VOLE's Natalie Ng Man-yan, badly
        miscast), but she is too distraught to offer any leads. Flashbacks
        reveal her assailant to be Sin Ho-fun (Samuel Leung Cheuk-moon), a
        homely, put-upon crew member, whom Mazy tried to help via a free
        discussion session in her office. The paranoid and delusional Sin soon
        misinterprets one of her comments and, later that day, drugs and rapes
        the woman, the first in a series of assaults he perpetrates. Once she
        has recovered, Mazy and Wong join forces in order to apprehend Sin, who
        has now graduated to murder.</image:caption
