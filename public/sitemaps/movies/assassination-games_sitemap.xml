        >Brazil is a contract killer, willing to take any job if the price is
        right. Flint left the assassin game when a ruthless drug dealer’s brutal
        attack left his wife in a coma. When a contract is put out on the same
        coldblooded drug dealer, both Brazil and Flint want him dead – one for
        the money, the other for revenge. With crooked Interpol agents and
        vicious members of the criminal underworld hot on their trail, these two
        assassins reluctantly join forces to quickly take out their target
        before they themselves are terminated.</image:caption
