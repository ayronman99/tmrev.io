        >Some things can be seen more clearly at night.. . A film poem about a
        continent at night, a culture on which the sun’s going down, though it’s
        hyper alert at the same time, an “Abendland” that, often somewhat
        self-obsessively, sees itself as the crown of human civilization, while
        its service economy is undergoing rapid growth in a thoroughly pragmatic
        way. Nikolaus Geyrhalter takes a look at a paradise with a quite diverse
        understanding of protection. Night work juxtaposed with oblivious
        evening digression, birth and death, questions that await answers in the
        semi-darkness, a Babel of languages, the routine of the daily news, and
        political negotiation: All this has been captured in images with a
        wealth of details that make us look at things in a new way. The longer
        you consider a word, the more distant is its return gaze:
