        >A documentary on China, concentrating mainly on the faces of the
        people, filmed in the areas they were allowed to visit. The 220 minute
        version consists of three parts. The first part, taken around Beijing,
        includes a cotton factory, older sections of the city, and a clinic
        where a Cesarean operation is performed, using acupuncture. The middle
        part visits the Red Flag canal and a collective farm in Henan, as well
        as the old city of Suzhou. The final part shows the port and industries
        of Shanghai, and ends with a stage presentation by Chinese
        acrobats.</image:caption
