        >For the first time, public and political lives of Chinese villages are
        captured through the lens of the people who belong there. Villages can
        never be so real if filmed by an outsider. This video is a collection of
        ten short documentary films, each of ten minutes in length. They are ten
        funny films made by ten amateur villager filmmakers (age ranging from 24
        to 59) selected from around China who are eager to discover their home
        villages through the DV lens.</image:caption
