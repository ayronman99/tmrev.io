        >Aviv Geffen, the grandson of legendary Moshe Dayan and number one
        Israeli rock list, is rapidly becoming a mythic figure himself. He was
        the last person to embrace Rabin before that controversial politician
        was assassinated. The charismatic, bisexual singer-songwriter has
        rapidly become the Jim Morrison or Bob Dylan of his country, a voice
        that represents peace and integrity for a troubled young generation.
        Concert footage, kinetically edited and brilliantly shot, reveals the
        depth of feeling that many Israelis have for Aviv: hip, youthful women
        and men are clearly enamored of his presence. Directed by Tomer Heymann,
        this feature documentary follows the life of Aviv Geffen, a
        controversial Israeli singer whose liberal upbringing led him to refuse
        to serve in the Israeli military. Over the last six years, Geffen has
        become a spokesperson for the country's youth, and this film chronicles
        the rise of his career, his family roots, and how he finds the
        inspiration to write music.</image:caption
