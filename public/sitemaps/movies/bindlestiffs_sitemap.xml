        >Three high school virgins, suspended from school on a bogus graffiti
        charge, flee to the inner city in an attempt to live out the plot of The
        Catcher in the Rye - a book they neither have read nor understand.
        BINDLESTIFFS documents their struggles along the way as they surrender
        their virginities to vagrants, prostitutes, and crack fiends. Hot on
        their tail is Charlie, the deranged school security guard. Under the
        impression that the boys are planning a school shooting, he takes the
        law into his own hands to stop them and save America.</image:caption
