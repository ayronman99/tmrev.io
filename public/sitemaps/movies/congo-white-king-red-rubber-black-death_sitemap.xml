        >This true, astonishing story of what King Leopold II did in the Congo
        was forgotten for over 50 years. "Congo: White King, Red Rubber, Black
        Death" describes how King Leopold II of Belgium turned the Congo into
        his private colony between 1885 and 1908. Under his control, Congo
        became a gulag labour camp of shocking brutality. Leopold posed as the
        protector of Africans fleeing Arab slave-traders but, in reality, he
        carved out an empire based on terror to harvest rubber. From the
        mid-1880s and lasting for nearly 40 years, an estimated 10 million
        Congolese were killed under Leopold's reign. The madness only came to an
        end thanks to the efforts of British journalist and humanitarian E.D.
        Morel, who exposed the human rights abuses in Congo and published
        photographs of the mutilated Congolese.</image:caption
