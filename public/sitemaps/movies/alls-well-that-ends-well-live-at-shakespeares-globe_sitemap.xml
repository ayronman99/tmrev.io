        >Helena loves the arrogant Bertram, and when she cures the King of
        France of his sickness, she claims Bertram as her reward. But her new
        husband, flying from Helena to join the wars, attaches two obstructive
        conditions to their marriage - conditions he is sure will never be met.
        Featuring Olivier-award winning actress Janie Dee as the Countess of
        Roussillon.</image:caption
