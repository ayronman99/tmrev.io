        >It's that creepy time of year again...Halloween. And a group of friends
        have gotten together for a party at an old abandoned and haunted house
        where an entire family was once murdered. Seems totally safe right?
        Wrong. Dead wrong. Because not only do the kids decide to play some
        tricks and have a few treats, they manage to revive a supernatural
        killer; a killer hell bent on sacrificing them one by one to evil forces
        possessing the home. Will anyone escape? Or will they all be slain and
        become permanent residents of the infamous Amityville house? With
        original music by Nightmare queen Tuesday Knight, this is a night that
        none of them will ever forget ,for as long as they live.</image:caption
