        >Struggling author Samuel suffers from a whopping case of writer's block
        and, as a result, can't pay his rent. Forced to take in a roommate to
        cover costs, he's now inexorably tied to his housemate's felonious
        activities. But Sam hesitates to take action -- because suddenly he's
        inspired to write a killer story. Director James Roberts's quirky film
        ponders just how far a writer will go for the story of his
        life.</image:caption
