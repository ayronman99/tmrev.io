        >Louis and his girlfriend Fern are on the rocks. He finds some secret
        messages she left hidden in the pages of his books. Louis drags his best
        friend Ananda over to Fern's apartment to confront her. He doesn't want
        to keep finding these messages years after they have broken up. But that
        is precisely why she left them there. A short film about preserving old
        memories, originally appearing as part of the omnibus film Sawasdee
        Bangkok.</image:caption
