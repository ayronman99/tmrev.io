        >100 Stories is literally that: one hundred quick back to back stories
        that jump between the lives of three main characters. We have Helen, who
        works at a Biotech company and who has recently discovered fine cooking.
        We have her boss, Marshall, an over-focused executive who is slowly
        losing grasp on reality and his life. And we have Brian, a socially
        engaged bike messenger whose thoughts are blurring the line between
        activism and terrorism. All three are desperately trying to give some
        sort of shape to their lives, they are all, in essence, trying to write
        their story, and in this striving are actually dramatically altering the
        lives of those who come into contact with them.</image:caption
