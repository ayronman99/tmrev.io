        >In a little house all for herself, an elderly woman moves through her
        day. While she tends to every chore on the docket, we learn some things
        about her. She has a green thumb, she speaks Polish while on the phone,
        she likes to nap. A prayer sounds. They are words from her
        mother-in-law, Polish poet Zofia Bohdanowiczowa, who was also displaced
        from her native Poland. Three generations meet, one by writing, one by
        living, and the third by the very making of this film, a composition of
        her ancestors through sound and image.</image:caption
