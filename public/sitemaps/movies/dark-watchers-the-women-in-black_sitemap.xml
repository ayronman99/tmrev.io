        >More and more UFO sightings occur every day. Across the globe people
        are losing time, friends and loved ones disappear, while the Men in
        Black are perpetually lurking in the background. In a sleepy seaside
        village, three women search the skies for a sighting of a UFO that is
        repeatedly haunting the area. Every day they venture out until one day
        they return having completely lost 4 hours from their lives. Their need
        to understand the UFO's and why they are here opens a world they could
        never have imagined and takes them into the heart of a dark and
        secretive universe populated by the Men in Black. Coming face to face
        with the unknown, they begin to realize that they have been profoundly
        affected by their encounter. To make matters worse, they begin to evolve
        into something amazing, yet horrifying - something beyond their worst
        nightmares. Beware the Dark Watchers. Written by Philip
        Gardiner</image:caption
