        >Khattaab al-Naggary is a widowed businessman who loves his daughter
        Habeeba and tries to keep men away from her. Officer Taarek, the almost
        perfect young man, who proposes to his daughter, has already helped him
        out when he was caught in an awkward situation with one of his lady
        friends. Yet Khattab still wants to ruin his daughter’s marriage and
        puts obstacles in their way. Habeeba insists and so he agrees. For their
        honeymoon, they choose to go to a remote island. Upon their arrival,
        they find Khattaab waiting for them with his silly plans to keep them
        apart. Ensheraah, Taarek’s mother, comes to their aid. Habeeba gives
        birth and Khattaab marries Ensheraah. The story repeats itself and
        Khattaab cannot stop himself of over protective to his lovely
        granddaughter.</image:caption
