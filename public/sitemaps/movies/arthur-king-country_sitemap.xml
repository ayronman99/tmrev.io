        >The legend of King Arthur is one of the greatest in English folklore,
        and tales of brave, chivalrous knights rescuing damsels in distress
        never fail to thrill and delight audiences of all ages. Even now, King
        Arthur is more popular than ever, and this program will take you on a
        fantastic journey of discovery to explore this beloved legend. From the
        ragged, dramatic cliffs of Tintagel in Cornwall, where it's claimed
        Arthur was born, to the peaceful serenity of Glastonbury Abbey, where
        visitors can stumble upon King Arthur's grave, this truly is a
        remarkable story. Search for the magical ancient island of Avalon,
        uncover the hill where Arthur and his knights lie sleeping, and piece
        together the colourful cast of characters that surrounded England's
        favourite king. Whatever your interest in King Arthur, the intoxicating
        mix of mythology and fact will prove utterly
        irresistible.</image:caption
