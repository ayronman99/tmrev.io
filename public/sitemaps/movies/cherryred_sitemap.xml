        >Anna and Marie are two women who could possibly love each other. Marie
        wants to be open to this new overwhelming feeling, even if she has to
        throw away all that she has ever held to be right. Anna on the other
        hand, enjoys the attention from this gentle soft girl Marie, who seems
        to love her, not in spite of but also because of her sharp edges. It
        could all be so easy if it weren't for Zoe, the woman who has been at
        Anna's side for years.</image:caption
