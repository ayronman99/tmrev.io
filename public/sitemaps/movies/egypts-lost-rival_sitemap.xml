        >Located between the warrior kingdom of the Hittites and the powerful
        empire of Egypt, the ancient city of Qatna was wiped off the face of the
        earth as it grew too powerful ? its role in the rise of the Egyptian
        empire lost in the desert sands. Qatna and its many treasures lay hidden
        from humanity until now. In ten years of archeological digs, the lost
        city has been rediscovered and a team of international scientists has
        excavated its long-held secrets. Egypt's Lost Rival unearths the ground
        breaking discoveries hidden from the world for millennia.</image:caption
