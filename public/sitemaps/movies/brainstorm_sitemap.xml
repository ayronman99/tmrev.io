        >A trip to the mental institution hell. This odyssey is lived by Neto, a
        middle class teenager, who lives a normal life until his father sends
        him to a mental institution after finding drugs on his pocket. The
        maconha cigarrete is just the final drop that exposes the family
        tragedy. Send to a mental institution, Neto gets to know a completely
        absurd, inhumane reality in which the people are devoured by a corrupt
        and cruel institution system. The documentary type language used by the
        director give this movie a sensation of realty that increases even more
        the impact of the emotions Neto goes through. In the mental institution,
        Neto is forced to mature. The transformations that he goes through
        change this relations with his father.</image:caption
