        >In June of 2012, LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh and the Miami
        Heat made good on a promise to deliver a championship to the basketball
        fans of South Florida. It seemed unlikely that they would ever be able
        to match the drama and the intensity of that title run in an encore
        performance. But this was no ordinary basketball team. From the opening
        night of the 2012-13 NBA season, the Heat were determined to prove that
        not only were they up for the daunting challenge to repeat as champs but
        they were also destined to become one of the most successful and
        celebrated teams in history. No one could have anticipated the
        breathtaking 27 game winning streak that would catapult the Miami Heat
        into one of the biggest stories of the year. And after sweeping the
        Milwaukee Bucks, dispatching the Chicago Bulls and outlasting the
        Indiana Pacers, Miami would take home their second consecutive title
        after an epic seven game series with the San Antonio
        Spurs.</image:caption
