        >After her mother is killed by a car bomb, a 17-year-old girl lives a
        reckless and decadent lifestyle. She begins having sex with a boy who
        works at a local ski resort. He falls in love, and she tells him of her
        suspicions that her strict father was responsible for her mother's death
        and wants him to help her out of her situation. He must decide whether
        she's telling the truth or using him to her own ends.</image:caption
