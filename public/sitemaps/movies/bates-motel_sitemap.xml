        >Alex West is a man who roomed with Norman Bates at the state lunatic
        asylum for nearly 20 years. After Bates' death, Alex finds that he is in
        Norman's will as the inheritor of the Bates Motel, which has been vacant
        since Norman's arrest. Alex travels to Bates' California hometown and
        with a little help from a teenage runaway, Willie, Alex struggles to
        re-open the motel for business, only to have strange things happen. Is
        someone trying to drive him away, or is the motel really haunted by the
        ghost of Norman's mother?</image:caption
