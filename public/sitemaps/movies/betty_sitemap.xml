        >Drunk, Betty is feeling worse and worse, the previous evening is slowly
        coming back to her: her husband and her husband's family had criticized
        her harshly, had sent her away. But Betty hadn't wanted to get married
        in the first place. She knows that she always ruined everything, that
        she drinks to much, that she has had several affairs. Laure, who is
        taking care of her, suggests that Betty stay with her in the hotel where
        she lives, as long as Betty would like. Laure, too, finds solace and
        companionship in alcohol.</image:caption
