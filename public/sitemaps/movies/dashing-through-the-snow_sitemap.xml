        >Stranded at an airport at Christmastime, Ashley Harrison accepts a ride
        from Dash Sutherland, who has just rented the last car in town. As the
        pair heads north, their adventures include car trouble, adopting a puppy
        and being secretly tailed by federal agents, who believe Ashley is up to
        no good. With a hint of romance gradually filling the air will these two
        fall in love or will their journey bring about an unexpected road bump
        to romance?</image:caption
