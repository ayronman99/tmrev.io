        >David Icke tells the astonishing story of how the world is controlled
        today by royal bloodlines seeded in the ancient world that have passed
        through history, manipulating the human race for thousands of years. The
        bloodlines that were the kings and queens of the distant past are the
        same bloodlines that today produce the political leaders and those who
        control the banks, transnational corporations and media. Using hundreds
        of illustrations, Icke exposes this biggest secret and explains how and
        why we are now racing towards a global fascist state - unless we wake up
        fast. He also offers the spiritual (not religious) road to freedom and
        says that we can transform the world and our lives by transforming
        ourselves and understanding our true power to design our own destiny.
        What has happened? What is happening? What can happen? All is revealed
        in this eye-popping, mind-blowing, heart-pounding,
        program.</image:caption
