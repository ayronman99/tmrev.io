        >The Galactic Patrol is back - but they've lost Deputy Rod Allbright's
        body. It's been stolen by B'KR, the most fiendish villain in the galaxy,
        which leaves Rod's mind sharing one body with his annoying cousin
        Elspeth. Stranded on a mysterious alien planet, our young heroes embark
        on a mission to find the only being who can stop B'KR once and for all,
        the legendary time-strider himself; Art Allbright - who also happens to
        be Rod's dad. The Galactic Patrol's high-flying adventures continue in
        this thrilling second film based on the global best-selling book series
        from acclaimed author Bruce Coville and Simon and Schuster Children's
        Publishing. This rip-roaring sequel draws the crew of the Good Ship
        Ferkel into a web of alien plots that will test their courage to the
        utmost -- and ultimately bring them face-to-face with one of the
        galaxy's most guarded secrets.</image:caption
