        >While dinosaurs may have been some of the mightiest creatures ever to
        have walked the earth, they also could have been among the most bizarre.
        With extreme, exaggerated body parts, some predators were loaded with
        outlandish or disproportionately sized appendages. Join world-renowned
        paleontologists and travel the globe to unearth some of the lesser-known
        but most surprising members of the dinosaur family: Mamenchisaurus,
        whose neck alone was longer than the rest of its body; Chasmosaurus,
        adorned with a fashionable crown of frilly spikes to attract the eyes of
        potential suitors; Spinosaurus, with massive extensions from its
        vertebrae that could have supported a sail or a hump; and
        Parasaurolophus, whose tube-like head crest may look odd to us, but was
        a mating magnet back in the day.</image:caption
