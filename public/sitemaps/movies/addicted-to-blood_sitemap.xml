        >'Addicted to Blood'follows one hot aspiring actor and a few gorgeous
        young actresses, after another, as they find themselves duped by a horny
        nest of vampires,leaded by the Dark and Mischievous Kristal,who are just
        into hanging out,stripping down to nothing at all,and party and play all
        Night long,until Dawn hits,of course!Very soon all the pretty boys and
        girls find themselves with a nasty vampire bite on the neck and bleeding
        to death on the floor. Usually, the vamps' seduction approach involves
        one of two pieces of bait: the promise of fame via their vampire acting
        school or, more directly,Crystal Meth,to let any inhibition go away .
        Both work extremely well, in some sort of fictitious/sarcastic Kind of
        Infamous Way.</image:caption
