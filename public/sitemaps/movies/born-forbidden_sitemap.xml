        >Story of a girl who was thrown on garbage after being born as a result
        of prostitution, picked up by the servant of a rich man and was adopted
        by his maid Zainab. BBC later on made a documentary about the child and
        a lady from England went and adopted that baby. When she grew up and
        watched the documentary somewhere, she came to know who she was and what
        happened with her. She went to meet that lady, Zainab, who adopted her
        first, and was still living in the same area. When she arrived to pass
        time with that family, people started pointing fingers on her,
        remembering her childhood. Zainab, once again could not accept the
        disrespect for her daughter (Meharun Nisa) and Mehar had to leave again
        to go back to Alina 's House, where she had been a respectable citizen
        always.</image:caption
