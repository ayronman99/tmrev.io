        >Working as a designer for a clothing company, Song-mi, feeling
        skeptical about her heavy workload and repetitive daily life, decides to

        deeper into her sea, Songmi felt that her body and mind, which had been
        weary of her, were healed. In order to return this 'gift of healing' she

        with installation artist Boseong and aqua aerobics instructor Doui.
