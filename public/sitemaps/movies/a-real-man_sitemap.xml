        >Marko is 40 years old and still lives with his mother. His life is
        settled between work and home. His colleague Ajda tries to approach him,
        but without success. Marko always returns to his mother, without whom he
        cannot manage. And when it already seems like he will never separate
        from his mom, she takes matters into her own hands. Will Marko finally
        grow up?</image:caption
