        >Vincenzo dedicates his life to the bookshop he owns in Paris and to his
        daughter Albertine, forced to stay home because of an accident occurred
        to her a few years earlier. One day Yolande, an exuberant, eccentric,
        funny and beautiful girl, bursts into Vincenzo’s shop. Charmed by her
        vital energy, the man starts feeling again emotions he’s been
        chocking-off for too long, and which will make him question his
        melancholic and somehow suspended way of facing life.</image:caption
