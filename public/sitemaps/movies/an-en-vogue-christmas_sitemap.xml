        >Over the years, the funky divas of En Vogue have gone their separate
        ways, until they are asked to perform a benefit concert to save the club
        that made them stars. They put aside their hesitations to reunite for
        the special night, but first must overcome their challenging history
        with Marty (David Alan Grier, "In Living Color"), their former manager
        and the man responsible for breaking them up. In the spirit of the
        holidays, the ladies find forgiveness and come together for an epic En
        Vogue Christmas concert to keep the club from closing its doors forever.
        Stars Terry Ellis, Cindy Herron, Rhona Bennett as themselves and
        features some of En Vogueâ€™s biggest hits and two new original songs.
        Genelle Williams also stars.</image:caption
