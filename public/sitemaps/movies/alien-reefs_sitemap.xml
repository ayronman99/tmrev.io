        >Coral reefs are believed by many to have the highest biodiversity of
        any ecosystem on the planet. A lot of the life found here can seem very
        alien at first, they occupy less than 1 percent of the ocean floor but
        yet are home to more than 25 percent of all marine life. Warm water
        reefs typically come to mind when thinking of the Pacific Ocean and the
        Caribbean Sea, these reefs are very well known but they donâ€™t just occur
        in warm waters. In this one hour special, we are brought into this alien
        environment and discover for ourselves a strange, hidden world that is
        simply abundant with life, ranging from the weird to the
        wonderful.</image:caption
