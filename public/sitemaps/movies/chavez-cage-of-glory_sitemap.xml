        >Barely being able to make ends meet and doing everything he can
        possibly do to cover his ill son's growing medical bills, Hector Chavez
        turns to his fighting roots in the underbelly of LA. His amateur Mixed
        Martial Arts videos go viral grabbing the attention of the world's top
        MMA federation. Hector is then given a dream come true opportunity to go
        up against the MMA World Champion; a vicious fighter whose last opponent
        is in critical condition in the same hospital as his son. Hector is
        faced with a real do-or -die situation and must risk it all so his son
        can have the surgery he needs to survive.</image:caption
