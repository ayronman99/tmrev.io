        >Based on the true life experiences of poet Jimmy Santiago Baca, the
        film focuses on half-brothers Paco and Cruz, and their bi-racial cousin
        Miklo. It opens in 1972, as the three are members of an East L.A. gang
        known as the "Vatos Locos", and the story focuses on how a violent crime
        and the influence of narcotics alter their lives. Miklo is incarcerated
        and sent to San Quentin, where he makes a "home" for himself. Cruz
        becomes an exceptional artist, but a heroin addiction overcomes him with
        tragic results. Paco becomes a cop and an enemy to his "carnal",
        Miklo.</image:caption
