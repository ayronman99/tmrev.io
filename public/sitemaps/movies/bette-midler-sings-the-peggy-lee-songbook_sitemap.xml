        >Bette Midler performs four songs from her recording "Bette Midler Sings
        The Peggy Lee Songbook". Selections include "I'm A Woman," "He's A
        Tramp," "Fever," and an alternate take version of "Is That All There
        Is?" The program also includes interviews with Bette, along with Nicki
        Lee Foster and Holly Foster Wells (Peggy Lee's daughter and
        granddaughter.) along with never before seen vintage home movies from
        the Peggy Lee estate. A highlight is a home movie montage scored to
        Bette's recording of "Folks That Live on the Hill." This program was
        created as the exclusive DVD content for the Dual Disc release of
        Bette's Peggy Lee tribute.</image:caption
