        >For forty years, the public functionary and family man Lineu and his
        beloved wife Nenê celebrate their first date going to the same ball
        where Lineu borrowed the jacket his competitor Carlinhos. In the present
        days, Lineu feels uncomfortable when his colleague Pacheco dies and goes
        to the doctor for health examination. When the result of his tomography
        arrives, his doctor says that he had seen some blur in his lungs and
        with that report he would give the correct diagnosis. Lineu steals the
        document afraid of having a tumor, but he believes he will die sooner.
        Meanwhile, Nenê meets Carlinhos in the supermarket where he is the
        manager and invites him to have dinner with her family. Lineu hides his
        concerns to Nenê, and his attitudes in the dinner misguide Nenê, and she
        believes Lineu has a lover and does not love him anymore</image:caption
