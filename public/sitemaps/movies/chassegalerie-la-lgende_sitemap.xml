        >In 1863, a group of snow-bound travelers invokes the devil, who gives
        them a flying canoe for them to go home. When one of them finds his wife
        about to die in labor, he makes a pact with the devil to save her and
        his newborn daughter Liza. He then cheats the devil of his prize by
        sacrificing himself. 25 years later, Liza wants to marry her beloved
        Jos, who has to go away to a remote logging camp to earn money to save
        his farm, but the devil is determined to ruin her
        happiness.</image:caption
