        >Janine works in a bank giving credits to clients to buy houses and
        receives the offer of a promotion to work in a future branch in China
        for which she takes Mandarin classes. One night he travels from work to
        his home on the subway. There is attacked by two young delinquents a
        very old woman and Janine tries to avoid it. The young follow her and it
        is then that they steal and attack her sexually. After recovering from
        the blows and the anguish he gets up and sees his attackers raping a
        helpless young girl. Janine, instead of taking some initiative to stop
        them, flees home. From that situation her life is disrupted and her job
        promotion to China, her consolidated partner and her present as an
        independent woman become secondary and worthless issues. Janine lives in
        anguish and tormented by the memory of that traumatic situation. To try
        to recompose himself, he travels to the countryside to see his father
        who is a widower and is trying to rebuild his life after the death of
        his wife.</image:caption
