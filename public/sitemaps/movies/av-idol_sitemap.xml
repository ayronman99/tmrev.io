        >Brave and sexy and hot Hallyu idols are coming! Ryoko the AV movie
        goddess is getting tired of AV movies. She feels somethings wrong when
        she hears that her next movie is taking place in Seoul, Korea where
        Hallyu is centralized. She goes through trouble starting from the
        Incheon Airport with depthless production fees and unexperienced staff.
        Then she meets idol wannabe Yuna. Ryoko lies to her that she is a
        popular Japanese idol actress and takes her to the AV movie set. The AV
        movie director is interested in the new face and casts her right away in
        a new AV movie. Will they be able to make this new AV
        movie?</image:caption
