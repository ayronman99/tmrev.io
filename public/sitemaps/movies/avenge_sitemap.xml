        >In a world where trust is not easily earned, Officer Ramirez (Roberto
        Mendez) goes under-cover as a streetwise, high-volume drug runner to
        AVENGE his slain partner's death at the hands of a drug lord named
        Antonio (Arturo Ramirez) and his right-hand man Dante (Willie Green).
        These guys have no mercy for any under-cover cop that tries to bring
        down their empire. Things take on a new twist when Officer Ramirez
        realizes that Antonio is merging his affairs with BIG BOSS Casino Jones
        (Andrew Carter). Now he has to take down the city's biggest drug cartel
        by himself. You won't believe how this story will end!</image:caption
