        >When strangers Jim, Eva, Emily and Mo meet William online in his new
        'Chelsea Teens!' chatroom, they're completely seduced by his
        fast-talking, charismatic character. But beneath the surface lies a much
        darker truth. William is a dangerous loner, channeling all his energies
        into cyberspace. He's become an analyser, a calculating manipulator who
        finds it almost impossible to interact normally with others in the real
        world, instead turning his hand to manipulating people
        online.</image:caption
