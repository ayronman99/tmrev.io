        >Victor, a successful and well-respected businessman, is obsessed by the
        legend that an indigenous woman told him when he was a child. Victor
        lives a conventional life with a family that knows and complains about
        his constant infidelities. When the woman is dying, she sends for Victor
        and her son Jose Francisco, who is working as his chauffeur. They both
        answer the summons. Their lives take an unexpected turn.</image:caption
