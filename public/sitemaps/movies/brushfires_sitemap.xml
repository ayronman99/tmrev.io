        >When a shy girl, secretly in love with her rocker-grrl housemate, meets
        an unbalanced heiress on the run, anything could (and does) happen in
        BRUSHFIRES, the latest production from Chicago-based film group Split
        Pillow. As the three women negotiate the dangerous relationships among
        them, the seven women directors weave a sensual tale of suspense.
        Drawing inspiration from the poem by Jessica Wilbur and the surrealist
        parlour game, The Exquisite Corpse, each director selected a word or
        phrase on which to base her segment, and the seven chapters of the film
        bear their individual marks. This impressive experiment in filmmaking
        emerges as a sensitive tale of young desire, loss, and love's
        confusion.</image:caption
