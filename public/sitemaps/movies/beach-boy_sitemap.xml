        >Like the majority of young Kenyans, Juma dreams of a better life
        abroad. His girlfriend has left to work in Qatar, allowing the young man
        to fully thrust himself into his work as a “companion” to elderly
        European women who spend their vacations at local resort hotels. Danish
        filmmaker Emil Langballe records in detail what appears to be a budding
        love affair between Juma and a middle-aged British woman. The
        documentary turns out to be a real-life version of Ulrich Seidl’s
        feature Paradise: Love, investigating local female sex tourism based on
        a false sense of romance.</image:caption
