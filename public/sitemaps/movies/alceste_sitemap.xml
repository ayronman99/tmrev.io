        >The special aspect of the opera Alceste is its designation as the
        "first opera in the German language." The ancient drama about Alceste
        was written in the form of a play for theater by the Enlightenment
        playwright Christoph Marlin Wieland and set to music by the acclaimed
        late-18th-century composer Anton Schweitzer. This performance of the
        newly edited opera based on the historic play was begging to be captured
        on DVD. The demanding singing parts are delivered in brilliant manner by
        the four soloists, ably accompanied by Concerto Koln, one of the most
        renowned early music ensembles.</image:caption
