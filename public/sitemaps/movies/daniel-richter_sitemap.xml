        >Few artist portraits give us the privilege of getting as close to the
        painter as if we had free access to his studio. Over a period of three
        years, Pepe Danquart got to accompany the painter Daniel Richter,
        watching him paint, negotiate with his gallerist, talk to his publisher
        and joke with fellow artist Jonathan Meese. Danquart interviews
        collectors, attends auctions and even visits record
        shops.</image:caption
