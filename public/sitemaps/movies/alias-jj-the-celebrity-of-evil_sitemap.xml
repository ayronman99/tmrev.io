        >This is a shocking documentary where the audience will meet Jhon Jairo
        Velazquez Vasquez known as Popeye or Alias JJ, Pablo Escobarâ€™s
        right-hand man until he decided to surrender to justice to save his
        life. After serving a twenty-three year prison sentence he became the
        only survivor from the Medellin Cartel. Velazquez has called the public
        opinion attention because of his controversial statements before the
        justice and the media, involving Escobar with high government members,
        the police, and criminal organizations worldwide. Through interviews
        with witnesses, victims of the Medellin Cartel and different public
        opinion figures, this documentary intends to contrast those stories that
        have made Alias JJ famous.</image:caption
