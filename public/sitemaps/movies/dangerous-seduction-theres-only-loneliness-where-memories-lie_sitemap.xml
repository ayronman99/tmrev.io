        >So-yeon lost her parents to a car accident at an early age and she's
        buried in loneliness. Many men have come by but they've all disappeared
        like the wind. She's been cheated of money by two men who promised to
        marry her so she settles by herself in a cabin out there, which her
        parents had bought before they passed. So-yeon decides to rent out the
        rooms and then a man comes along. She feels emotional towards him and he
        seduces her, turning their tension into a hot relationship. The more she
        falls for him the more he asks for unexplainable and sadistic
        actions...</image:caption
