        >Winter, 1944. Lucía at 21 returns to her small village in the
        mountains. She again meets Manuel, a young iron-smith who helps "those
        in the mountain", the "maquis", the anti-Franco resistance. Lucía is
        attracted to Manual, because of his smile and the bravery of those men
        who continue fighting for their ideas, even at the cost of their own
        lives. When Manuel is pursued (by Franco's Civil Guard) he flees to the
        mountain and Lucía discovers the reality of political repression, the
        silence, the horror and fear.</image:caption
