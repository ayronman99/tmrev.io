        >A group of Anglican nuns, led by Sister Clodagh, are sent to a mountain
        in the Himalayas. The climate in the region is hostile and the nuns are
        housed in an odd old palace. They work to establish a school and a
        hospital, but slowly their focus shifts. Sister Ruth falls for a
        government worker, Mr. Dean, and begins to question her vow of celibacy.
        As Sister Ruth obsesses over Mr. Dean, Sister Clodagh becomes immersed
        in her own memories of love.</image:caption
