        >After successfully won the Tokyo qualifying tournament, Chihaya and her
        friends are set to go on to the nationals. As they prepare, Chihaya is
        faced with new personal issues as her childhood friend and inspiration,
        Arata, has announced that he has quit competitive karuta. Not only that,
        but a new rival emerges in the reigning female champion karuta player,
        Shinobu Wakamiya, a karuta prodigy who became the nation's and the
        world's greatest female karuta player as a 9th grader. All of this
        forces Chihaya to reexamine her love of the game in the midst of
        preparing for one of the biggest tournaments of the year.</image:caption
