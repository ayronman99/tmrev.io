        >The blood orchid - a rare flower that could hold the secret of eternal
        life and be worth a fortune to the company that finds it. Led by a
        pharmaceutical research team, a scientific expedition sets out to
        explore deep into the jungles of Borneo to locate and bring back samples
        of the legendary plant. Battling through rainstorms to make their way
        upriver, the group encounters poisonous insects and a ferocious
        crocodile, only to discover they're being stalked by an even greater
        danger: a gathering of giant anacondas! Heat-sensing, fifty-foot-long
        flesh-eaters that'll go after anyone that crosses their
        path!</image:caption
