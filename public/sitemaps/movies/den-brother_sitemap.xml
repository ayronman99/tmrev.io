        >Alex Pearson has a lot to learn about teamwork. As the star of the
        Lemon Oaks hockey team, Alex almost always has his way on and off the
        ice. That ism until he pulls a stunt so outrageous not even his own
        coach can give him a pass. His punishment? Suspension from the team, a
        never-ending list of chores and a job watching his little sister Emily
        after school.</image:caption
