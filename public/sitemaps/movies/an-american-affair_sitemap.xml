        >In the early 1960s, teenager Adam Stafford (Cameron Bright) becomes
        obsessed with his new neighbor, Catherine Caswell (Gretchen Mol), a
        divorc√©e and free spirit. Stafford spies on Caswell as she meets with
        strange men, and, despite the warnings of his conservative parents, he
        begins working for her as a gardener. Amid rumors of her affair with
        President Kennedy, the two become close, but political intrigue
        surrounding her acquaintances soon infringes on their
        friendship.</image:caption
