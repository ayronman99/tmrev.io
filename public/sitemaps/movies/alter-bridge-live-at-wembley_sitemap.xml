        >Alter Bridge Live At Wembley is a stunning show shot in HD and 3D on
        November 29, 2011 at the historic Wembley Arena in London in front of a
        sold out crowd of over 10,000 die-hard fans. The show is the most
        significant moment in the band's 8-year career, as their goal from day
        one was to play Wembley. The band ripped through a 21 song set featuring
        songs from all 3 of their albums including the hits: "Rise Today",
        "Watch Over You", "Blackbird", "Ghosts Of Days Gone By" and "Isolation".
        The film was directed by Award-winning Director Daniel E Catullo III,
        who also produced and directed the band's previous DVD "Live From
        Amsterdam".</image:caption
