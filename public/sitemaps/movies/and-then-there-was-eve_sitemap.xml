        >Alyssa, a successful photographer, wakes one morning to find her
        apartment ransacked and her husband mysteriously missing. Left without
        even a photograph to offer the police, she turns to her colleague Eve, a
        talented jazz pianist with a flirtatious charm and disarming grace. Eve
        helps her confront her husbandâ€™s longtime struggle with depression and
        to, over time, accept his absence. While getting to know this woman
        through such unusual circumstances, Alyssa is surprised to find herself
        falling in love again.</image:caption
