        >Documentary - Princess Diana's former butler, Paul Burrell, discusses
        accusations that he stole some of her possessions in this video diary,
        which includes interviews before the trial began and after it was called
        off because of new evidence uncovered by the queen. The program sheds
        light on the man accused of stealing from Diana's estate after her
        death, digs into his private audience with the queen and reveals the
        reasons the trial was dismissed in 2002. - Paul Burrell, Trevor
        McDonald, Princess Diana</image:caption
