        >Jean-Paul Belmondo returns to the settings of a fantastic career,
        accompanied by his son Paul. Over a career spanning 50 years, Jean-Paul
        Belmondo’s movies drew over 130 million people into cinemas. This
        logbook takes us back to sets and countries, from where we can revisit
        the films in reference and find out about his fruitful collaborations
        with various directors. Paul Belmondo will lead the investigation,
        meeting the stars and his father’s friends (eye-witnesses all) and
        questioning his father about his journey, sharing it with us so we can
        discover the man and his story like never before.</image:caption
