        >Distraught by the suicide of her gay friend Matt, Alexa travels from
        Amsterdam to her dead friend’s small American town, hoping to uncover
        the reasons that led Matt to take his own life. She arrives with a
        backpack, her video camera and intentions to make a film about what it
        must be like to be gay in Bumblefuck, USA. At the end of her hot summer
        weeks in Bumblefuck, she’s made a new special friend, clashed with
        others, and ultimately discovered more about herself than she could ever
        have imagined.</image:caption
