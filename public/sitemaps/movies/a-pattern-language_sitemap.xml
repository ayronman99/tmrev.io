        >Featuring the Kugel Gips house in Wellfleet, MA, designed in 1970 by
        Cape Cod architect Charles Zehnder and restored by the Cape Cod Modern
        House Trust in 2009. This film was made during an artists' residency I
        had there in March 2010. The title is taken from the book "A Pattern
        Language: Towns-Buildings-Construction" by Christopher Alexander. This
        book is the second in a trilogy that sets forth a structured
        architectural philosophy of self-designed environments. This piece was
        shot on 16mm film using colored filters and single-frame exposures. The
        color was not manipulated in the digital edit. Each color corresponds to
        one of 5 notes in the Romanian B Minor scale.</image:caption
