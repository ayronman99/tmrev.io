        >Drowning in the depths of depression and sadness, burning with anger,
        and chained down by alcoholism, Jonathan couldn’t do it anymore. After
        the loss of his father as a young boy, facing countless horrific death
        scenes in the line of duty, and the death of his son, Jonathan turned to
        the world for answers — finding only darkness. Faced with the threat of
        losing all that is left to him, Jonathan turns to faith and finds hope
        and redemption.</image:caption
