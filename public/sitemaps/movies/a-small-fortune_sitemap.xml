        >Kevin is an Irish Moss farmer committed to his traditional way of doing
        things at the expense of a more lucrative life for himself and his
        pregnant wife. When he finds a bag of money washed up on the shores of
        Prince Edward Island, his decision to keep it secret turns his quaint
        fishing village into a growing crime scene as the moneyâ€™s owners come
        calling. A Small Fortune is a story of one man's struggle to provide for
        his family and the need to let go of the old ways in order to learn
        money isn't everything. Adapted from Adam Perry's award-winning short
        film A Blessing from the Sea.</image:caption
