        >After a nuclear war decimated the northern hemisphere, the surviving
        population in the south become desperate and violent competing for
        scarce resources. Society crumbles and an infectious bacteria threatens
        to destroy those who remain. In an attempt to rebuild civilization, a
        self appointed government called 'The ORDER' distributed an immunization
        to the bacteria, via a massive Electro-Macnetic Pulse (EMP). Secretly,
        the Order also delivered a bio-tech virus through the EMP, giving them
        the power to control the population. One man remains immune to the
        Order's virus - Jake Slater. Now Jake scavenges the wasteland searching
        for a way to keep his unconscious daughter alive, unaware she is the
        last child on Earth, and the key to the survival of
        mankind.</image:caption
