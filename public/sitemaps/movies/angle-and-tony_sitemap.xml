        >Angèle, a beautiful young woman with a past, arrives in a small fishing
        harbor in Normandy. She meets Tony, a professional fisherman, who finds
        himself attracted to her although he dislikes her blunt ways. Tony hires
        her as a fishmonger, lodges her and teaches her the tricks of the trade.
        The relationships between Myriam, Tony's mother, and Angèle are far from
        easy but the young woman gradually adapts to her new environment and
        little by little Tony and Angèle manage to tame each
        other.</image:caption
