        >Ray Pluto has many problems. He is satirized in the tabloids as the
        "loser cop." His partner is starting to seem suspiciously attracted to
        him. A pair of screenwriters across the hall keep bugging him for help.

        own rebellious daughter. To top it off, a sexually aggressive
        chiropractor may just be Ray's undoing.</image:caption
