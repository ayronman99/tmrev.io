        >The story of a Chinese-trained opera singer living in a remote Kazakh
        village with her grandmother and her ailing young niece. The bulk of the
        action consists of the steadfast heroine trying to make enough money to
        get the rare and costly medicine that may save her niece's life. What
        makes the film so thrilling is that this elemental situation allows the
        director and his cast of non-actors to illuminate the details of
        everyday life: reality and fiction dissolve into each other, and the
        audience achieves a heightened awareness of simple activities like the
        cooking of a meal, teaching a child to count in Chinese and English,
        visits to the doctor or the marketplace. Entirely improvised by the
        filmmaker and his actors.</image:caption
