        >Diving Deep: The Life and Times of Mike deGruy, tells the story of Mike
        deGruy, an irrepressibly curious and enthusiastic underwater filmmaker
        who died suddenly in 2012. DeGruy filmed the oceans for more than three
        decades becoming as famous for his on camera storytelling as for his
        glorious, intimate visions of the sea and the creatures who live in it.
        Inspired to share his legacy as a filmmaker and storyteller, and to
        spread his mission for protecting the ocean, his wife and filmmaking
        partner Mimi deGruy returned to the edit room to produce Diving Deep:
        The Life and Times of Mike deGruy.</image:caption
