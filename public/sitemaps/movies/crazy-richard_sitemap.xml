        >A mockumentary about the perils of child stardom, Crazy Richard has as
        its hapless subject Richard Veed (Richard Viede), a former child actor
        attempting to make a comeback after nearly dropping dead of a drug
        overdose at the age of 13. Now playing a gay teen in the late-night TV
        offering "I Can't Even Think Straight," Richard is hell-bent on
        regaining his former luster, and, as such, allows filmmaker Katrina
        Mathers to record his every move on film. From his trailer tantrums to
        naked cavorting on the beach, there is nothing Richard will not allow on
        film, resulting in footage more satisfyingly awful than a typical
        episode of E! True Hollywood Story.</image:caption
