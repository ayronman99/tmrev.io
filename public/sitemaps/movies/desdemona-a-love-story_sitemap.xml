        >Gil Garcia is at the end of his life. Wounded and bleeding in a church
        confessional, he tells an unsuspecting Father Wade his tragic story. At
        a young age, Gil's father takes him to America in search of a better
        life, forcing him to leave the girl he loves in Mexico. Orphaned shortly
        after arriving, Gil is taken in by his father's only friend, Dustin, who
        raises Gil along with his own son, Rod. Fifteen years later, Gil &amp;
        Rod have yet to find their way in life, still living at home and playing
        basketball on the streets for money. When cancer overtakes Dustin, they
        are faced with a funeral bill they cannot afford. Desperately searching
        for a solution, Rod suggests kidnapping for ransom. Gil knows of the
        perfect person: a woman married to a wealthy man who would never risk
        the life of his loved one for the relatively small amount of money in
        question. But Rod doesn't know the whole truth - the woman is Desdemona,
        Gil's childhood love from Mexico.</image:caption
