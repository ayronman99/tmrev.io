        >It's the story of a double trip. A physical journey, the one in which
        the chemist Albert Hoffman really took his bicycle to go back home in
        the 1943's spring under the effects of an unknown substance he was
        testing (lysergic acid diethylamide, better known as Lsd). But it's also
        the symbolical journey, inside the scientist's mind, representing the
        feelings he may have felt. Our bet is to narrate this event researching
        new images, creating our own version of a '40s styled
        psychedelia.</image:caption
