        >This documentary explores near death experiences, UFO’s, ORBs, global
        changes, and extra terrestrial encounters. With live UFO footage and
        first hand accounts of other-world encounters, this film is among the
        first to explore questions such as where did they come from? And why are
        they here? The film features James Gilliland, an expert in the area of
        E.T. phenomena, who has appeared regularly on the popular radio show
        “Coast to Coast A.M.” It's filmed at Gilliland’s ranch in Trout Lake,
        Washington which serves as the primary location for Gilliland’s E.T.
        encounters. The movie delves into Gilliland’s life story, his own near
        death experience, his personal encounters with other worldly beings, and
        also includes interviews with physicists and other experts who have
        visited the ranch and share their perceptions of these phenomena. The
        films includes appearances by Dr. Miceal Ledwith, Neil Freer, Dr. Brooks
        Agnew, Afred Webre, and Dr. Michael Salla.</image:caption
