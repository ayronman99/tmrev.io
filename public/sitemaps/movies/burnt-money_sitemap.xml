        >Set in Argentina in 1965, the story follows the tumultuous relationship
        between two men who became lovers and ultimately ruthless bank robbers
        in a notoriously famous footnote in the annals of crime history. After a
        large-scale hold-up that turns bloody, the two men must flee. It is not
        long before the police are surrounding the building they are in and they
        must confront their demons to survive.</image:caption
