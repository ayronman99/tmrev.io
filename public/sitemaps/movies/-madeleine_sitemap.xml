        >1999 Madeleine is the first step in an ambitious project by the French
        filmmaker Laurent Bouhnik to make one film per year between 1999-2009,
        recounting the turn of the century in an interweaving narrative pattern.
        Episode one is about Madeline, a lonely woman obsessed by religion and
        cleanliness. Her solitary existence leads her to place an advertisement
        for a man willing to share his life with a 'single, working
        35-year-old.' She is a woman of our times who is caught between the
        paradoxes of modern life and individual needs for communication. The
        world offers her opportunities to satisfy material needs but,
        unfortunately, this is to the detriment of her spiritual
        needs.</image:caption
