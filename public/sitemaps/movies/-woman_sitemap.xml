        >100% Woman begins as Michelle Dumaresq's mountain-bike riding career
        did, careening down a rocky path to be met with controversy. From some
        critics comes cautious concern, from others, complete attack. At the
        centre of it all is the past of this extreme athlete, the first 20-odd
        years of life that Michelle spent as Michael. In 2002, Dumaresq became
        the first openly transgendered woman in the world to be named to a
        national team in any sport. Beginning with her days on the BC race
        circuit, to the Canada Cup, the national title and a berth at the World
        Championships, her progress is dogged by constant scrutiny, both from
        fellow competitors and the media. Dumaresq insists she doesn't race to
        make a stand, but doesn't shy from being a trailblazer. She grew up in
        turmoil over her identity and struggled to come to terms with herself as
        an adult, even with her parents' whole-hearted support. She takes on the
        mantle of role model because she understands how isolated others like
        her feel.</image:caption
