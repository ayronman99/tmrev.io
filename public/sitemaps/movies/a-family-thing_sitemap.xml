        >Earl Pilcher Jr., runs an equipment rental outfit in Arkansas, lives
        with his wife and kids and parents, and rarely takes off his gimme cap.
        His mother dies, leaving a letter explaining he's not her natural son,
        but the son of a Black woman who died in childbirth; plus, he has a half
        brother Ray, in Chicago, she wants him to visit. Earl makes the trip,
        initially receiving a cold welcome from Ray and Ray's son, Virgil. His
        birth mother's sister, Aunt T., an aged and blind matriarch, takes Earl
        in tow and insists that the family open up to him.</image:caption
