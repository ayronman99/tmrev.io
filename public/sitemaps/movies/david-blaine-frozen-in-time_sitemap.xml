        >On November 27, 2000, Blaine began a stunt called "Frozen in Time",
        which was covered on a TV special. Blaine stood encased in a massive
        block of ice located in Times Square, New York City. He was lightly
        dressed and seen to be shivering even before the blocks of ice were
        sealed around him. A tube supplied him with air and water while his
        urine was removed with another tube. He was encased in the box of ice
        for 63 hours, 42 minutes and 15 seconds before being removed with chain
        saws. The ice was transparent and resting on an elevated platform to
        show that he was actually inside the ice the entire time.</image:caption
