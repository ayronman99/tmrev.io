        >In a small town near the mountains of Argentina, Juana tries to commit
        suicide but ends up in a coma instead, to the great pain of her daughter
        Marta. Her other daughter Mercedes comes from Buenos Aires but is less
        interested in her mother's condition than in possibly getting her money.
        Marta's husband has a great offer for a piece of land owned by Juana,
        but can't do anything while she is in a coma.</image:caption
