        >Ahla el-Awqat (The Best of Times) tells the story of a successful
        middle-aged woman (Salma, played by Hanan Tork) who is left to live with
        her step father after a not-so-tragic accident that claims the life of
        her mother. Salma goes on a quest to find out the identity of the sender
        of mystery letters and packages. One letter includes a picture of her
        and her two best friends from school (played by the Hend Sabry and Menna
        Shalaby), whom she has not seen for 14 years. Reunited, the girls embark
        on the quest of finding the identity of the sender.</image:caption
