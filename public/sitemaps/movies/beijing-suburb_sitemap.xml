        >From Variety: "Guaranteed to never screen in any legit mainland Chinese
        venue due to its daring depictions of rebellious artistic protest as
        well as explicit sexuality, Hu Ze’s “Beijing Suburb” is a quietly
        masterful work portraying really struggling artists. This remarkable
        case of art imitating life observes a tiny community of painters and
        various multimedia artists — social critics all — operating
        clandestinely in a courtyard-style building in the capital’s outskirts.
        Hu’s film itself is clandestine, in the manner it reveals the hardships
        these artists must endure, in its quiet advocacy for the artists’
        position, and also in its strong erotic content, carried to an extent
        comparable in the region only to South Korean cinema. Brave fests should
        do everything they can to secure a print, as difficult as that might
        be."</image:caption
