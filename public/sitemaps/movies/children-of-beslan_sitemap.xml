        >On September 1, 2004, a group of heavily armed rebel extremists stormed
        into School No. 1 in Beslan, Russia. For three days, more than a
        thousand children and adults were held hostage in a sweltering
        gymnasium, denied food and water, and forced to keep their hands over
        their heads. The harrowing siege ended on September 3 with a series of
        explosions and a hail of gunfire that killed some 350 people - half of
        them children. In this film, the youngest survivors of Beslan tell their
        story.</image:caption
