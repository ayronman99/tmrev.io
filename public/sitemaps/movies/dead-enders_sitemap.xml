        >A disturbed woman, haunted by the death of her “one true love”, kidnaps
        and brutalizes those she believes to be his living successor. Held
        captive in a subterranean prison, Robert begins a fight for his survival
        from a sadistic captor willing to kill anyone who disturbs her suicidal
        plans. To save himself, Robert must survive booby- trapped mazes,
        implements of torture, and an evil presence which feeds his captor’s
        insanity and hides from the world the dark secret of
        “Max”.</image:caption
