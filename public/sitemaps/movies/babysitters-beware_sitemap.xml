        >Seven-year-old Danny Parker is a good kid who loves his parents. But
        they have to go out on business dinners all the time, leaving him stuck
        with a sitter. It's not so bad when it's his favorite babysitter,
        Janelle but he also gets stuck with sitters like Ms. Greene who won't
        let him have any fun. Danny just wants to spend more time with his Mom
        and Dad.</image:caption
