        >214 million years ago a gigantic meteorite broke up and impacted Earth.
        65 million years ago, the impact that killed the dinosaurs occurred
        where the country of Belize stands today. 200 thousand years ago early
        humans were walking and died when they were hit by a 40 meter wide
        meteorite hit South Africa creating a 1.4 km wide crater. This meteorite
        fragment, the largest ever found hit Namibia 80 000 years ago and more
        recently a major impact occurred in Toungouska, Russia in 1908. Every
        year 10 000 tons of meteoritic matter fall onto Earth in much smaller
        but not necessarily less influential pieces. This film will explore how
        the impact of these meteorites big and small through the ages have
        changed our world and what they brought from outer space with them that
        may have been the seed of life itself on Earth.</image:caption
