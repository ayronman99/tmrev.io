        >A black president. Gays in the military. Women who like jerks. Carlos
        Mencia has something to say about it all in his new stand-up special,
        Performance Enhanced, held in front of a packed house at a Hard Rock
        Hotel theatre in Florida. Watch as he talks about his trip to Iraq, his
        real feelings on the N-word, and just about everything else that pops
        into his head. With his trademark frenzied performance style, you have
        our word that this is 100% Carlos---just slightly enhanced for your
        entertainment.</image:caption
