        >After finishing his MA in Anthropology, Hugo spends his days giving his
        brain a rest from the endless reading of texts by unknown authors. His
        only company is Luisa, the cleaning lady, with whom he plays cat and
        mouse. To escape the sleep of reason – which creates monsters -, Hugo
        exercises his lyrical vein by writing, with his friend Manuel, songs
        about their neighbourhood. The quiet dilettantism of our protagonist is
        shaken by Catarina, a young and beautiful translator who’s starting her
        professional life as a freelancer. Hugo is hooked and wavers. High
        above, a kestrel falcon hovers. It’s not the only bird of prey that can
        do it.</image:caption
