        >Street kids Kolya, Irina, Ksusha and Denis describe the abandoned
        building they live in as 'a Fairytale place' where anything is possible.
        Their gang have relied on each other since they were young kids;
        stealing, begging and turning tricks to survive on the streets of the
        broken, post-Soviet city of Perm, Russia. All born in the years after
        the collapse of the Soviet Union, they have created their own kind of
        society as together they battle with freezing temperatures, harassment
        from the police and their very vulnerable existance, using drink and
        drugs to block out the horrors of life and escape into fantasy. The four
        face their brutal, unforgiving world with grit and often caustic humour,
        but now, on the brink of adulthood, time is running out for any of the
        group to escape their toxic situation. Told with candid honesty and
        heart-breaking humour, A RUSSIAN FAIRYTALE is both eye-opening and
        utterly compelling, with tragic revelations woven between glimmers of
        hope.</image:caption
