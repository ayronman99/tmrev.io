        >Chukkalanti Ammayi Chakkanaina Abbayi is a 2013 Indian Telugu-language
        family drama film directed by Kanmani. It stars Tarun and Vimala Raman
        in the lead roles. The music was composed by Anoop Rubens. The film
        which was in production since 2009, finally released on 25 May 2013 to
        poor reviews and was declared a flop at the Box Office and didn't give
        Tarun the much wanted boost in his comeback to films</image:caption
