        >Karma, a Tibetan filmmaker from New York, goes to Dharamsala, the Dalai
        Lama's exile headquarters in northern India, to make a documentary about
        former political prisoners who have escaped from Tibet. She wants to
        reconnect with her roots but is also escaping a deteriorating
        relationship back home.One of Karma's interviewees is Dhondup, an
        enigmatic ex-monk who has just escaped from Tibet. He confides in her
        that his real reason for coming to India is to fulfill his dying
        mother's last wish, to deliver a charm box to a long-missing resistance
        fighter. Karma finds herself unwittingly falling in love with Dhondup
        even as she is sucked into the passion of his quest, which becomes a
        journey into Tibet's fractured past and a voyage of
        self-discovery</image:caption
