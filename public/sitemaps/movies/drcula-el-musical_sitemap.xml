        >Based in B. Stoker's novel, the musical that triumphed in Argentina and
        the world for 25 five years, is a success of Pepe Cibrián Campoy, his
        author and director, and of Ángel Malher, his composer. The musical
        picks up the story of count Dracula, inmortalized by Bram Stoker in his
        1897 novel, with an exceptional cast leaded by, in the role of Dracula,
        Juan Rodó; Candela Cibrian in the role of Mina, Jonathan's enamored,
        who's interpreted by Leonel Fransezze; Luna Pérez Lening embodies Lucy's
        cousin, possessed by the count's spirit; the nanny is played by Adriana
        Rolla and, as Van Helsing, Germán Barceló. This invaluable cast is
        accompanied by talented dancers and singers as the
        ensemble.</image:caption
