        >In July 2001, over 200,000 people took to the streets of Genoa to
        protest against the ongoing G8 summit. Anti-globalization activists
        clashed with the police, with 23-year-old protester Carlo Giuliani shot
        dead after confronting a police vehicle that would later run him over
        twice. In the aftermath, the police organized a night raid on the Diaz
        high school, where around 100 unarmed people between protesters, mostly
        students, activist lawyers, and independent journalists who documented
        the police brutality during the protests had took shelter. What happened
        next would be called by Amnesty International "the most serious breach
        of democratic rights in a Western country since World War
        II."</image:caption
