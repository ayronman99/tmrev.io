        >Cop drama meets romance: This intense thriller is about a police
        officer who shoots his best friend (who also wears a badge) while on the
        job. His buddy is permanently paralyzed, and the incident raises
        eyebrows around the precinct. Was it an accident, or did this
        detective's feelings for his pal's wife cause him to cross the line?
        Only true super sleuths will figure it out before the
        end!</image:caption
