        >This fascinating documentary offers an unprecedented look at a group of
        individuals who claim to have had life altering UFO encounters, and
        discovers the unique psychic abilities they unknowingly share. From
        unexplained sightings and alien contact, to prophetic dreams,
        clairvoyance and astral projection, we explore the phenomena that has
        surrounded these "experiencers" from childhood to their adult years.
        This documentary explores the theories of who and what the "visitors"
        really are, and uncovers a plausible scenario for their intentions, as
        well as the government's involvement in suppressing this information
        from the public. Perhaps the greatest revelation is the shocking
        possibility that the alien visitor's greatest acquisition will be
        achieved, not from probing our bodies, but rather by invading our
        minds.</image:caption
