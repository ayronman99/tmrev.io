        >'Terror of Frankenstein' is an exercise in extreme meta-fictional
        tragicomedy. Presented as the commentary track of a rushed reissue of a
        forgotten (but 100% genuine) Frankenstein film's DVD (because of
        unspecified 'recent events'), this project transforms the film into an
        entirely new, very human horror story. Featuring Clu Gulager as the
        director of the 1977 original who is happily exploiting the unmentioned
        tragedy linked to the film, the recording session unravels a mystery as
        he clashes with the screenwriter (Zack Brown) and, ultimately, its star
        (Leon Vitali from Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut and Barry Lyndon,
        playing himself.) 'Terror of Frankenstein' is Mystery Science Theater
        3000 by way of Sartre, an icy satire of the monsters onscreen, behind
        the camera, and in the audience.</image:caption
