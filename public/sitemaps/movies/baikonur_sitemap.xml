        >“Whatever falls from heaven, you may keep.” So goes the unwritten law
        of the Kazakh steppes. A law avidly adhered to by the inhabitants of a
        small village, who collect the space debris that falls downrange from
        the nearby Baikonur space station. The last two youthful members of the
        village are the radio operator Iskander, known as Gagarin, and the
        spirited Nazira. While Nazira finds it increasing difficult to conceal
        her love for Iskander by means of her unconventional behaviour, Iskander
        is evidently not only crazy about Baikonur and the vastness of outer
        space, but also deeply smitten with the beautiful French astronaut Julie
        Mahé, whose journey to the stars he wistfully follows on
        television.</image:caption
