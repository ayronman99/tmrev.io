        >This rare collection of Ryan Trecartin's early short films, produced as
        a student at the Rhode Island School of Design, showcase the artist's
        maturation in experimental video which would culminate in his debut
        feature film - "A Family Finds Entertainment." Included are seven of
        Trecartin's titled short films, ranging from 2001-2003, and a number of
        secret extras scattered around the DVD menus. While there is no official
        information to be found about this DVD, the elaborate menu graphics and
        wildly varied original sound design point to this DVD as potentially a
        form of portfolio, allowing the artist to showcase their early work
        alongside original digital manipulations.</image:caption
