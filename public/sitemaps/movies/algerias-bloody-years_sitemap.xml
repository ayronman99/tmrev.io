        >Algérie(s) chronicles the country's struggle for peace, stability and
        democracy since independence from France. The documentary combines
        recent and archival interviews, newsreel footage, and recently filmed
        footage from Algeria to trace the origins of the violence that has left
        as many as 200,000 dead since 1988. Algérie(s) begins with a brief
        historical survey of events in Algeria since independence in 1962, and
        moves on to focus on the democratization process set in motion after the
        October 1988 riots, the success of Islamist groups in elections, the
        subsequent cancellation of these elections by the military, and the
        country's descent into violence, up to the present day. The film
        provides an excellent overview of recent events and asks tough questions
        about their causes, and humanizes a conflict that was all too often
        reported deep inside the newspaper with little more than "score cards"
        of the numbers killed.</image:caption
