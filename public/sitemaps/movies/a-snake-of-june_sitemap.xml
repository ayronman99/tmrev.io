        >Rinku is a suicide-prevention counselor, living with her husband
        Shigehiko. He's older than she, scrubbing things constantly, sexually
        indifferent. They sleep apart. During Tokyo's rainy season, Iguchi, a
        photographer Rinku has counseled by phone, sends her pictures he has
        taken through her skylight: she's wearing a short skirt, masturbating.
        He offers her the negatives if she'll follow his instructions. She's
        humiliated and agrees. He tells her he's only giving her license to
        express her inner desires. He sends her into the night to walk on the
        wild side. Then, she asks a favor of him, and soon her husband receives
        phone calls and photographs. Where will this triangle
        lead?</image:caption
