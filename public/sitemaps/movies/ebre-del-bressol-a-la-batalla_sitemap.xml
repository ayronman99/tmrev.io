        >In 1938 the Spanish Civil War has worn both armies and destroyed the
        mood of the people of both sides. The differences between national
        Republicans however are revealing: The fascist side has the
        unconditional support of arms and men facilitated by Hitler and
        Mussolini while the Republican army is ignored by a Europe more
        concerned of a possible World War than the fate of Spain. Thousands of
        young people between 17 and 18 rows are called by the republican army.
        These are the main characters, four young for whom the Battle of the
        Ebro will be the first direct contact with the war. This film tells the
        story of these young people forced to leave behind innocence and into
        whistling bullets.</image:caption
