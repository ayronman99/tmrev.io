        >Tania is the golden child of the teachers because she is smart. But her
        schoolmates find her too serious. Moli, the new student, is the exact
        opposite of Tania. But the other students, also reject her for being too
        extreme. Nobody is willing to go with Moli except Tania. Seeing Moliâ€™s
        life, Tania suddenly feels that her life is very boring. She starts
        doing all the things that Moli does - speeding in a car, clubbing,
        cigarettes, alcohol, and even sex. Tania enjoys all this, especially the
        attention she gets from her schoolmates due to the change in her. When
        her family finds out about her dramatic change, Tania chooses to get
        away from them. However the party ends when Moli leaves her. And Tania
        has to fight alone to find the way back to her true self.</image:caption
