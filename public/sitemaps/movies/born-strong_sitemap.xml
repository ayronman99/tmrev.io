        >Born Strong is the story of the four strongest men on the planet. Each
        year, the Arnold Strongman Classic crowns the winner in the purest test
        of strength on the planet. This year’s Arnolds are unique with each of
        these four weighing more than 400 pounds. Lithuanian Zydrunas Savickas,
        40, is the acknowledged Strongest Man Ever, who may have passed his
        prime. American Brian Shaw is the defending champion, a 6’8’, 425-pound
        giant who seems poised to take the crown. England’s Eddie Hall is “the
        hungry wolf, ” knocking on the door. “I’ll do anything, ” he says. “I’ll
        die, if I have to. ” Finally, there’s Icelander Hafthor Bjornsson, who
        plays the Mountain on Game of Thrones. He’s the youngest of the group,
        but with perhaps the greatest potential. “It’s great to see these
        Monsters, ” says Arnold Schwarzenegger, the host of the competition and
        a former bodybuilding champion. Born Strong revels in the drama when
        these remarkable giants clash.</image:caption
