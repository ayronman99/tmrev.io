        >Takashi Fujiki stars as a rebel in this drama about life on the
        Yokohama waterfront by New Wave director Masahiro Shinoda. The rebel
        works as an errand boy for a shipping company and vents his frustrations
        by plucking on the guitar. His interpretations of popular trends in
        music are sometimes right-on, and sometimes not exactly. Bereft of his
        guitar, the rebel's modes of expression are not as effective in
        generating interest as the Yokohama docks themselves, a fascinating
        world in their own right.</image:caption
