        >Mithun Chakraborty plays a powerful and domineering priest who rules
        his temple and the surrounding village with an iron fist, all supposedly
        for the sake of religion. He becomes enamored with a prostitute
        (Sushmita Sen) from a local brothel and begins spending more and more
        time with her. But when the village postman (Anuj Sawhney) takes a
        liking to her as well, the priest is forced to deal with him and a
        growing village rebellion.</image:caption
