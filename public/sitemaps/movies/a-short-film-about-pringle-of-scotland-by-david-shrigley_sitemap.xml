        >In 2010, artist David Shrigley was commissioned by Pringle of Scotland
        to create a short animated film to celebrate the brand's return to Milan
        Fashion Week. The animation, showcased during Pringle of Scotland's
        menswear show in Milan on 18th January, depicts the making of jumpers
        and cardigans over the past 195 year history of the Scottish
        brand.</image:caption
