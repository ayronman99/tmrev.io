        >EDDIE, an intimate look at the life of one of basketball’s most
        legendary coaches, takes audiences on a turbulent ride across Sutton’s
        five-decade career and provides an unprecedented off the court look at
        both the demons that haunted him and the relationships crucial to
        overcoming them. With a wealth of never-before-seen footage and
        interviews with Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, a “who’s who” of
        college basketball, elite journalist, coaches and players, and even
        former President Bill Clinton, EDDIE is a complex story rooted in
        basketball, but exploring universal themes of substance abuse, tested
        relationships, and most importantly, perseverance.</image:caption
