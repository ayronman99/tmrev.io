        >Feluda and his cousin Topshe goes to Lucknow with Topshe's father to
        spend the Puja vacation. They arrived at the house of Dhirendra Kumar
        Sanyal, a friend of Topshe's father. That evening Dr. Shrivastav also
        came to Dhirendra Kumar Sanyal and tells him about last night, a thief
        tried to steal his 'Ring of Aurangzeb' (The Emperor's Ring) which was
        given to him by Pyarilaal Seth. After the incident Dr. Shrivastav has
        been afraid and asks Dhirendra Kumar Sanyal to keep the ring safe.
        Dhirendra Kumar Sanyal agreed and keeps the ring to his home. But
        someday the ring goes missing from there. Then Feluda and Topshe started
        investigation for the culprit. Meanwhile, Feluda meets an interesting
        person in doctor's neighborhood, Mr. Bonobihari Sarkar. Bonobihari babu
        has ferocious and poisonous creatures like crocodile, African tiger,
        hyena, rattlesnake, scorpion and black widow spider in his own
        home.</image:caption
