        >In a seaside town where very little happens, middle school students
        Keisuke Isobe and Koume Satou live a rather dull life. But when Koume's
        crush breaks her heart, their situation becomes quite unordinary. She
        starts a "no-strings-attached" relationship with Keisuke, whom she had
        previously rejected, both finding solace in the other in order to fill
        the emotional voids in their lives. However, being "friends with
        benefits" becomes complicated when real feelings begin to develop, as
        the consequences of their relationship start to take their toll on those
        around them and themselves. A Girl on the Shore takes a harsh look at
        love, relationships, and the emotional price that will be paid as the
        result of a decision made between two teenagers.</image:caption
