        >As a member of Missing Persons unit, Detective Skok realizes the first
        72 hours are the most critical in any investigation. When a young boy
        goes missing inside his own house, Skok immediately recognizes the
        unusualness of the case and takes the opportunity to have his team move
        in with the family and become residents of the crime scene. What follows
        is an absurd and comic investigation that leaves no stone unturned, no
        family member un-interrogatedâ€¦and no wall without an entire wallpaper
        made up of missing posters. An edgy and sometimes surreal comedy,
        director Mike Brune infuses his visionary directorial debut with
        eccentric characters, mind games, and dry wit.</image:caption
