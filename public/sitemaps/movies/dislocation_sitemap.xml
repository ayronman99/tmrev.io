        >In February 2002, families living in the Robert Taylor Homes public
        housing development were given a 180 day notice of eviction. In six
        months, the community that had been their home for generations would be
        demolished. DISLOCATION chronicles the lives of tenants in one building
        as they move through the six-month relocation process. The filmmakers
        follow three families as they prepare for their own move and as they
        help others around them. Dislocation is a story of a community coping
        with its own impending demise. It is a tale of courage, hope, and
        survival.</image:caption
