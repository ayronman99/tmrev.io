        >Immortalised as one of the most scintillating and uplifting Christmas
        songs, 'Carol of the Bells' adapted from a popular and loved Ukrainian
        folk melody, came to represent the spirit of brotherhood and unity all
        over the world. The peaceful and neighbourly existence of three
        families, Polish, Ukrainian and Jewish, sharing a large house, musical
        evenings and merriment in the city of Stanislaviv in the years preceding
        and post war, is shattered. First in the Soviet occupation and the
        persecution of the Polish family, then, by the Nazi occupation of
        Ukraine, and the decimation of the Jewish family. Sacrificing their
        lives the Ukrainian family manage to save their neighbours' children and
        their own daughter. Death and loss come to these families, but the
        healing power and joy , and a promise that the Future Will Not be
        Cancelled which "Carol of the Bells' evokes will be
        everlasting.</image:caption
