        >Fed up with her parents' bickering, poor-little-rich-girl Maya (Dylan
        Penn) moves in with her boyfriend who is squatting in an old, condemned
        building on Manhattan's Lower East Side. With neighbors that are meth
        heads, junkies and degenerates, this depraved hell hole is even more
        toxic than it appears: After a virus born from their combined noxious
        waste and garbage infects the building's residents, one by one, they
        succumb to a terrifying pathogen that turns them into bloodthirsty,
        rampaging killers and transforms their building into a savage
        slaughterhouse.</image:caption
