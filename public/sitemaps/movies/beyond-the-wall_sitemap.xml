        >During the Cold War, Ulrich and Heike Molitor's attempt to escape from
        the GDR with their children hidden in the car ends in a prison
        conviction and both kids going to adoption unless they accept to leave
        daughter Rebecca behind to that fate and choose 'exulsion' with son
        Klaus. When the kids near adulthood, Klaus is frustrated that his
        parents only wine about his lost sister. Meanwhile, the time is ripening
        for the Berlin wall to come down. Rebecca's adoptive pa resists his
        wife's bitching to leave the Stasi.</image:caption
