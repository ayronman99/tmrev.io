        >It's been ten years since the creation of the Great Truce, an elaborate
        joint-species surveillance system designed and monitored by cats and
        dogs to keep the peace when conflicts arise. But when a tech-savvy
        villain hacks into wireless networks to use frequencies only heard by
        cats and dogs, he manipulates them into conflict and the worldwide
        battle between cats and dogs is BACK ON. Now, a team of inexperienced
        and untested agents will have to use their old-school animal instincts
        to restore order and peace between cats and dogs
        everywhere.</image:caption
