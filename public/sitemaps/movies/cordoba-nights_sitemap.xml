        >Finn (Raymond Turturro), drives around in an old car at night with a
        portable record player in the back seat pumping out a variety of tunes
        to help him make it through the night. Why is he out driving around
        every night? Because he's a burned out pizza delivery guy delivering
        pizzas in a city that seems as burned out as he is.</image:caption
