        >Sampath is an expert in car, seizing, and works for Atul Kulkarni, who
        is a financier in North Madras. Burma aka Parandhaman works under
        Sampath for peanuts and the moment he comes to know the true colors of
        his boss; he makes his crooked intelligence to show the jail for Sampath
        and eventually gains the trust from Atul after creating his own brand
        for siezing cars. Sampath comes back from the jail and secretly plans
        the downfall of Burma. Burma gets an opportunity to seize 28 cars and he
        has completed 99% of his job without any fuss only to get stuck on the
        last car. What happens to Burma and to the rest of lead characters forms
        the rest of the story with parallel stories layered like a double decker
        sandwich.</image:caption
