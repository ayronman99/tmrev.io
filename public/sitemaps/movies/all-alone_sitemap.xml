        >An over-populated, concrete-filled Los Angeles drives Maggie into fear
        and isolation. On the edge, her cries for change are neglected by her
        husband Ben. When she turns to her dysfunctional but affluent friends,
        Alex and Kyle, they propose an overnight camping trip to get away from
        the confines of the city and escape to the solitude of the mountains.
        Deep in the mountains, they encounter a self-proclaimed radical
        environmentalist, Birch. Although worlds apart, she and Maggie have an

        fuels an irreversible chain of events. Survival is
        uncertain...</image:caption
