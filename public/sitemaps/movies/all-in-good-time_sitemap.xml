        >East is East writer Ayub Khan-Din returns with another funny,
        tender-hearted portrait of family strife. Based on his popular play
        Rafta, Rafta (itself inspired by Bill Naughtons 1960s classic All in
        Good Time), the film is set in Bolton where Atul and Vina are
        celebrating their marriage. However, a honeymoon spent with his parents
        was not part of their plans. Thoughtless patriarch Eeshwar seems
        determined to emasculate and embarrass his son. As the weeks pass,
        consummating their union becomes an impossibility that threatens the
        couples entire future. A breezy mixture of heartbreak and hilarity, All
        in Good Time also offers peerless performances from original stage stars
        Harish Patel and Meera Syal.</image:caption
