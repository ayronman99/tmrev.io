        >Éric and Patrice have been friends since high school. Over the years,
        they have both taken very different paths: Éric has become a hedonist,
        has a string of girlfriends and is always on the look out for a new one;
        Patrice has become a monogamous father with a very ordered life. After a
        drunken evening, the two childhood friends find themselves cast back
        into 1986, when they were 17 years old. This return to the past is a
        dream opportunity to try to change the path their lives will take. What
        will they do with this second chance?</image:caption
