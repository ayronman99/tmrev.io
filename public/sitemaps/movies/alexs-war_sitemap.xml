        >Looking past caricature and propaganda to a searching and human
        character study, Alex's War draws on twenty-five years of Infowars
        archives, unprecedented personal interviews, and months of backstage
        access to examine the shattering of our shared national narrative
        through the rollercoaster career of one of America’s most infamous,
        charismatic and divisive public figures. Building around Jones’ first
        ever independent long-form interviews, behind-the-scenes footage from
        his studio and rallies, and full access to the Infowars archives,
        acclaimed director Alex Lee Moyer traces the twenty- five year
        rollercoaster of a career that brings him to the manic election in the
        winter of 2020—a moment Jones sees not just as the culmination of his
        lifelong mission, but the decisive point in the fate of
        humanity.</image:caption
