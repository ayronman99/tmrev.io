        >The actual members of the Hong Kong Baseball Team all prove themselves
        to be natural actors by playing themselves in this fictional youth drama
        set in 2004. In a city where baseball culture is non-existent, these
        baseball players are a minority by choice. The experience teaches them
        to be free-thinkers in dealing with love, friendship and their own
        sexuality. It also enables them to find the will to live in the face of
        death and the strength to conquer losing in a spectatorless
        sport.</image:caption
