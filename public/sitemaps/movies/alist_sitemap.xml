        >Darren goes to Hollywood to tackle his dream of becoming an A-list
        movie star. However, once he gets there his dreams are crushed once he
        realizes the life of an actor isn't all of the glitz and glamour he had
        hoped. When Darren is mistaken for Dante, an A-list actor in tinsel
        town, Darren's world is thrown upside down. With gigs coming in left and
        right and the paparazzi on his tail, Darren gets his wish, for better or
        for worse.</image:caption
