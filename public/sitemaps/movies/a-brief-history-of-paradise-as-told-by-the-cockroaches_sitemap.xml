        >They say that when the Earth is destroyed beyond habitation, the only
        survivors will be the cockroaches. Filmmaker Joshua Oppenheimer gives
        the indomitable insects the floor in this perversely comic commentary on
        affluence and self-destruction. Leashed with thin ribbons, a small
        intrusion of cockroaches scramble over magazine spreads of the good life
        while a schizophrenic pest voice-over mutters like an asylum inmate
        recalling the good old days, when food was plentiful and the roach traps
        were the enemy. It is consumption and consumerism as empty activity and
        madness, played-out as a natural history documentary in the guise of an
        invasion picture, all set to the theme song from LOVE
        STORY.</image:caption
