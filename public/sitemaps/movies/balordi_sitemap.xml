        >The heart of the enchanting Tuscany landscape is home to one of the
        best guarded prisons in Italy. This fortress in Volterra is also
        backdrop for the performance of Bertolt Brecht's «Dreigroschenoper»,
        played by the inmates themselves. These tattooed, muscle packed men
        exhibit a completely different side of themselves as they run around the
        theatre like puppies. For quite some time, it seems as if we are
        watching two different documentaries: one about hard prison life, and
        the other about frolicsome actors in eccentric plumage. But gradually
        the two melt together: Meanwhile, we learn more about the background.
        One prisoner already had a gun when he was a fourteen-year-old boy in
        the slums of Palermo. Another always dreamt of joining the Mafia or
        becoming a doctor. Now that they are all in the same boat, these former
        street kids have combined forces. When prisoner Nicola, condemned for
        murder, performs Mackie Messer, he reinvents Brecht - and himself
        too.</image:caption
