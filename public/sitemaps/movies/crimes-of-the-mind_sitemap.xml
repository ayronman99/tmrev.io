        >The true story of Carolyn's Raeburn's daughter who graduated from high
        school at the age of 16. Laura was bright, popular and enthusiastic
        about the future, but the summer before she was to begin college, an
        event occurred changing forever the lives of her and her family. Laura
        visited a boarding ranch in the country to learn horseback riding. And
        there, she entered a world dominated by a strange and fearsome woman who
        took control of Laura's mind. She was groomed to replace the woman's
        dead daughter. Carolyn spent the next five years of her life, much of
        her sanity and more than half a million dollars to get her daughter
        back.</image:caption
