        >A child is born. We see underwater swimmers representing this. He is
        young, in a jungle setting, with two fanciful "instincts" guiding him as
        swooping bird-like acrobats initially menace, then delight. As an
        adolescent, he enters a desert, where a man spins a large cube of metal
        tubing. He leaves his instinct-guides behind, and enters a garden where
        two statues dance in a pond. As he watches their sensual acrobatics of
        love, he becomes a man. He is offered wealth (represented by a golden
        hat) by a devil figure. In a richly decorated room, a scruffy troupe of
        a dozen acrobats and a little girl reawaken the old man's youthful
        nature and love.</image:caption
