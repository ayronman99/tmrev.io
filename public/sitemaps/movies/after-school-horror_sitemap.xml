        >Rino, 3rd grade high school student, tells scary stories about the
        locked old toilet door in the school to his juniors who are in the
        probation for candidates of OSIS (school organization) leaders. Rino
        fiction is proved right: the locked toilet door exists. However, his
        friend, Andi still considers that the ghost in the toilet is just a
        myth. He makes a challenge for the candidates to open the door. Andi cs
        put cameras in the hallway to record those who fear.</image:caption
