        >Antonio and Agostino grew up together in a small town in Sicily; they
        dreamt of living a different life, somewhere else. Now thirty-year-olds,
        they both live abroad but they lost touch years ago. When Antonio
        discovers that the house he grew up in, which had been empty for a long
        time, is about to be sold at auction, he decides to leave and reconnects
        with his childhood friend. But their lives have changed a lot. Old
        conflicts and new revelations bring them through Europe on a truck
        journey.</image:caption
