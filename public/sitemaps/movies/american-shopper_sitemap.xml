        >"American Shopper" is a feature-length film about one man's passionate
        and comic struggle to start an unlikely new sport, and about the
        citizens of a small town who overcome their initial skepticism and get
        swept up in his crazy dream. The film follows the stories of several
        townspeople who decide to participate in the sport and compete in the
        1st National Aisling Championship, and whose lives are turned upside
        down in the process.</image:caption
