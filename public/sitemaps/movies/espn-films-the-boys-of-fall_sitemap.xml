        >Boys of Fall is a football documentary about life. Executive Producer
        and Country Superstar, Kenny Chesney began shooting footage and football
        interviews for his new single "The Boys of Fall" in fall 2009. After
        shooting footage of friend and New Orleans Saints' coach Sean Payton at
        his high school alma mater, Chesney decided to expand the video into a
        full documentary film. Over the next several months he filmed youth
        football games, high school football games &amp; locker room speeches as
        well as interviews with football greats. \After an introduction that
        includes Payton speaking to his old high school team in the locker room
        before a big game, it depicts how those who do not go on to long,
        storied careers in the NFL, like high school wide receiver Chesney, the
        lessons learned on the field help to shape who they are
        today.</image:caption
