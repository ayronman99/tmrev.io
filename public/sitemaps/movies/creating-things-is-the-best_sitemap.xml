        >People who create explore, and get to know themselves and others
        better. In this cinematographic essay, Rolf Orthel looks for the meaning
        of creating, with reality or the memory of it as a starting point and a
        train journey as a meandering ribbon through the film. We see the first
        musical steps of primary school children and youngsters at
        Jeugdtheaterschool Zuid-Oost. We see what talent does to you when a
        conservatory student practices for his graduation, when someone paints a
        remarkable self-portrait or when Konvooi creates a thrilling play. This
        is high-level creation which makes you wonder how on earth it is
        possible that you can suddenly be enchanted and moved. The conclusion of
        Orthelâ€™s search? Creating things is the best.</image:caption
