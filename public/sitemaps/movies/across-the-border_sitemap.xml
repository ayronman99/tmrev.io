        >Turin 1993. The architect Agnese is called to the home for war veterans
        where her ailing father lives. The doctor at the home has left his
        guest, a Bosnian refugee, on night duty with her father. The commanding
        officer of the veterans home, a colonel, has discovered the undocumented
        refugee, Reuf, and has had him arrested. Agnese, who would rather not
        get involved with refugees, becomes better acquainted with Reuf and is
        drawn into events which eventually take her to Bosnia. On this journey,
        she begins to recall her childhood directly after WWII. Experiences made
        during the two wars converge and the wheel of history turns, without
        failing to leave its mark.</image:caption
