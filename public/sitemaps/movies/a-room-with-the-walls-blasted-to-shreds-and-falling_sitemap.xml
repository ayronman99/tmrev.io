        >"A Room With the Walls Blasted to Shreds and Falling" is a
        non-narrative videotape shot entirely in and around central Ohio. This
        tape was shot over a two week period but means to document a “day” in
        the life of the Midwest—it begins at swim team practice at 8:00am and
        ends after midnight in the parking lot of an all-night grocery store. It
        is a series of idiosyncratic sequences which suggest a certain sense of
        extreme in the gestures of the everyday. A man waits for his flight in
        the airport. A teenage girl walks through her sub-division to meet a
        friend. An older woman washes her hair in the sink. A young boy sits on
        the floor playing video games. A plane flies overhead. Clouds shift.
        Cars move across the overpass. A grocery store is open all
        night.</image:caption
