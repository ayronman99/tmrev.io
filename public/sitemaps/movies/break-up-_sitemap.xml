        >Sam and Barbara have been together for eight years, but the key to
        their relationship is breaking up. Each time Barbara threatens to leave,
        Sam would give in and beg her to come back, giving her an increasing
        upper hand. After their 99th breakup, the couple finally decides to
        stick through with their relationship and not break up so easily. They
        plan a future together by running their own café. Ironically, the
        success of the café starts driving Sam and Barbara apart, and the 100th
        breakup between Sam and Barbara seems to be just around the
        corner.</image:caption
