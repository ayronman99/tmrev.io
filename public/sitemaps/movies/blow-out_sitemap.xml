        >Jack Terry is a master sound recordist who works on grade-B horror
        movies. Late one evening, he is recording sounds for use in his movies
        when he hears something unexpected through his sound equipment and
        records it. Curiosity gets the better of him when the media become
        involved, and he begins to unravel the pieces of a nefarious conspiracy.
        As he struggles to survive against his shadowy enemies and expose the
        truth, he does not know whom he can trust.</image:caption
