        >After 60 generations, thousands of individual muezzins - those who
        recite the Muslim call for prayer - stand to be replaced by a single
        voice broadcast from a radio station. CAIRO IN ONE BREATH follows five
        muezzins as this Adhan Unification Project takes hold and as Egypt
        undergoes Revolution and regime change. The story follows five muezzins
        from when they first heard rumors of plans to install wireless receivers
        in Cairo's 4,000 officially recognized mosques, through implementation
        of this Adhan Unification Project (AUP), which since 2010 has displaced
        thousands. Now, most mosques have receivers installed, though political
        changes have halted inspection and maintenance. Former muezzins who now
        perform other duties at mosques, recite the adhan when receivers
        (all-to-frequently) fail.</image:caption
