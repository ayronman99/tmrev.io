        >When a daredevil kid named Ernie, his sister Julia, and his best friend
        Max are horsing around in Max's inventor father's workshop, they
        accidentally trip a time-machine into operation and find themselves
        transported back in time 65 million years, where they meet a T-Rex named
        Tyra and her rambunctious dinosaur son Dodger. The unlikely group find
        themselves on an amazing adventure exploring the lush prehistoric
        jungle, despite Tyra's evil dinosaur rivals conspiring against them -
        while, back in the present day, Max's dad and Ernie and Julia's
        overprotective mom plot their rescue.</image:caption
