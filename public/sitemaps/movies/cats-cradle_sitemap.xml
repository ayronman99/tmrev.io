        >We wanted to make a film about a teenage mother. We met Joana in a
        casting that took place in Setubal, in the Bela Vista neighborhood. She
        appeared to us as a porcelain doll, small, fragile, pale, with a little
        hair bow. Little by little, she crumbled apart, revealing a charming
        complexity. We were conquered by the duality of strength and fragility,
        freedom and incarceration, joy and sorrow. The intimacy and complicity
        we were able to establish with her made this film possible. In Cat's
        Cradle, we share her with everyone else.</image:caption
