        >This musical will have you rolling with laughter as director Zack
        Stratis introduces the audience to his Greek-American family. Exploring
        his relationships with his siblings and his parents as they plan the
        celebration of his parents’ fiftieth wedding anniversary, Zack’s
        recurring question is "What should I say in my film?" Not only is he
        talking about the intricacies of his family’s "personal" life, but also
        about being gay in this traditionally closed family.</image:caption
