        >For Hussein, a pizza delivery driver, the imbalance of the social
        system is thrown in his face wherever he turns. One day when his friend,
        Ali, shows him the contents of a lost purse, Hussein discovers a receipt
        of payment and cannot believe the large sum of money someone spent to
        purchase an expensive necklace. He knows that his pitiful salary will
        never be enough to afford such luxury. Hussein receives yet another blow
        when he and Ali are denied entry to an uptown jewelry store because of
        their appearance. His job allows him a full view of the contrast between
        rich and poor. He motorbikes every evening to neighborhoods he will
        never live in, for a closer look at what goes on behind closed doors.
        But one night, Hussein tastes the luxurious life, before his deep
        feelings of humiliation push him over the edge.</image:caption
