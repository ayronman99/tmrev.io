        >Body Double is a feature-length film of a tropical landscape that
        appears in glimpses, interspersed with varying durations of a completely
        black screen, and methodically recut from Oliver Stone's Platoon (1986).
        The scenes of sky, mountains, foliage, and rivers are cropped into
        slivers, squares, and rectangles and the original cinematic audio track
        is left intact. By editing out all the visual narrative from the film
        and cropping the frame to focus on the peripheral landscapes, this work
        attempts to "search for the Philippines" via negation and reorientation.
        This video project ignores the original filmic story to focus on the
        artistâ€™s own attempts at discovering her place of birth, through the
        lens of an American empire that has superimposed its own narratives upon
        it.</image:caption
