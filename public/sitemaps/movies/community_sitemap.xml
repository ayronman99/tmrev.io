        >The Draymen Estate has become an urban legend. Amongst the sinister
        stories of unsavoury locals and brutal violence, several people have
        apparently gone missing. Even the police won't go there. Eter two naive
        student filmmakers with a well-meaning plan to make a sympathetic
        documentary of life on the estate. The unlucky duo quickly discovers
        that problems of drugs and crime in this community go way beyond the
        norm. This is a community which is about to present the students with
        material of unimaginable horror - turning their final project int their
        darkest nightmare.</image:caption
