        >Spain, 1970s. A Clockwork Orange, a film considered by critics and
        audiences as one of the best works in the history of cinema, directed by
        Stanley Kubrick and released in 1971, was banned by the strict Franco
        government. However, the film was finally premiered, without going
        through censorship, during the 20th edition of the Seminci, the
        Valladolid Film Festival, on April 24, 1975. How was this
        possible?</image:caption
