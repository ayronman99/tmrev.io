        >Arj Barker has appeared on several television comedy shows since his
        1997 appearance on Premium Blend. Most of his appearances are late-night
        shows such as Late Night with Conan O'Brien and The Glass House. He has
        had his own Comedy Central Presents episode on two occasions, first on
        20 September, 2000 and again on 31 March, 2006. He also has appeared on
        the Australian show, Thank God You're Here on 18 October, 2006 and the
        19th September, 2007 (the latter of which, he won). Barker also co-wrote
        The Marijuana-Logues, an off-Broadway show currently showing in New York
        - the title is a parody of production The Vagina Monologues. Doug Benson
        and Tony Camin also wrote the play, and all three perform in it as the
        original cast. Arj Barker also appears in the HBO sitcom Flight of the
        Conchords, as Dave, Bret and Jemaine's friend, whom they meet after
        moving to New York.</image:caption
