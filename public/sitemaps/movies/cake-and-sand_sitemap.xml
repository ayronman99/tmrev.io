        >Tim and Julian are deeply in love, but the gay couple can't have sex
        with each other. When you can't sexually satisfy the person you love is
        this enough reason to quit a long relationship? On a weekend trip to the
        sea, the boys want to spend some time together away from the pulsating
        city of Berlin where they live. The trip ends with two cakes in the
        sand. What if two people love each other but can't live with each
        other?</image:caption
