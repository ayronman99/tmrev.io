        >Mariana is a young woman looking to fulfill the dream she was once
        committed with when she left her parentsâ€™ house to live with Alex, in
        Lisbon. When he leaves to New York, she cannot bear what has been left
        for her. Even though the return seemed unthinkable, she goes back to the
        North. The burden of failure and the crossing of a legendary river, lead
        her to an ancient tale: once you cross the river of forgetfulness, your
        own past will also be forgotten. Alex returns while she is searching for
        a new setting for herself. He no longer believes in this country. She
        has gotten closer to the place where everything has started for her. He
        will leave. She will not return.</image:caption
