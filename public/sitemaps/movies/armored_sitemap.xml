        >After the death of his wife and his young daughter in a traffic
        accident for which he was responsible, Luna falls into a large pit of
        depression. Neither medication nor religion help him to keep going.
        Until one day, Luna has a dream that he receives as a revelation. In
        that dream, he sees himself driving a car and carrying a woman, Selva
        along with his son Beni. Luna takes it as a challenge and attempts to
        carry out his mission: to save the woman and the child from the
        dream.</image:caption
