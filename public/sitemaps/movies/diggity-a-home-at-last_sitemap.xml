        >Raymond is the family black sheep, relying on handouts from his
        half-brother, Otis. He's lost his job, his apartment, and all his
        confidence until word comes that he has inherited an English countryside
        property. Otis gladly purchases a one-way ticket for the new "Lord of
        the Manor". Except Raymond discovers his inheritance is no manor house,
        but a small, crumbling stone church that's the center of a scheme by the
        village scrooge, Malcolm Slee, in his frantic search for a valuable
        chest of gold hidden in the village by King Charles at the end of the
        English Civil War. Raymond initially accepts Slee's offer to purchase
        the church, but has second thoughts when he learns from the local Bed
        &amp; Breakfast owner Rachel that a family with children lives on the
        property. As Raymond and Rachel begin to bond, Raymond is singled out by
        a mysterious young orphan named Diggity, who believes that if he helps
        Raymond find his way in life, he will earn his wings as an
        angel.</image:caption
