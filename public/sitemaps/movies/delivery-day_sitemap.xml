        >For 11-year-old Trang, it's going to be one of those days - she has to
        get her Vietnamese mother to attend her school's parent-teacher
        interview but it also happens to be delivery day for the garments in her
        mother's sweatshop and her mum is way too busy. DELIVERY DAY is an
        insight into the world of duck eggs, Toyota Celicas and outworkers,
        which explores both generations of the Vietnamese migrant experience
        through the eyes of a young girl. It is one of the few Australian dramas
        to depict Vietnamese Australians.</image:caption
