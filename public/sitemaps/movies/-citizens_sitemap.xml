        >When the film broke out that a young man coming from a rich adopted
        family murdered his birth father, the controversy around the case hit a
        nerve with the public at large. An experiment was held through the form
        of virtual court inside a college to discuss this hot topic. During the
        process of virtual court, 12 Chinese people from different walks of life
        got together and discussed the case like a jury. Through intricate and
        thought provoking questions from the main character, people start to
        think more critically about the case. During this process, one sees the
        revelation of people's bias and emotional-preconceptions about the
        suspect, about each other, and also about the society.</image:caption
