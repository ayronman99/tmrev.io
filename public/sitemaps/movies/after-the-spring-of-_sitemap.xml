        >Film about falling in love across a political, cultural and geographic
        divide. It tells of Simon, a Dutch communist student in Moscow, who
        meets and marries the Russian Zoya in the spring of 1968. Simon returns
        to the Netherlands, expecting his wife to follow shortly afterwards when
        her exit visa is granted. Her application however is refused over and
        over again. Months pass and then years. A child is born to Zoya in
        Moscow: director Aliona van der Horst relates her parents' struggle in
        this tender account of family history caught up in international
        politics. In the numerous love-letters he wrote to his beloved Zoya
        feelings of helplessness are expressed: 'Our happiness depends on how
        the political wind blows'. Van der Horst uses these letters as a
        guideline through the film. To tell her parents' story, Van der Horst
        weaves together archival footage, home movies and photographs with
        contemporary interviews.</image:caption
