        >Will is a 30-something website manager who uses local caf√©, Coffee
        Town, as his office. When the owners of the shop discuss plans to
        convert Coffee Town into a bar, Will enlists the help of his two best
        friends Chad and Gino to save his freeloading existence. In order to
        thwart the plans of Coffee Town's owners, the trio stages a robbery to
        create the illusion of an unsafe neighborhood not suitable for the
        proposed venue. Also standing in their way is Sam, a disgruntled barista
        with delusions of grandeur and Will's heartache over unrequited love for
        Becca.</image:caption
