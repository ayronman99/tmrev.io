        >Chouga is a beautiful, rich and beloved young woman. She is thirty and
        lives in Astana, the Kazak new capital. She is married to a famous
        scientist in his sixties and has a seven-year-old son. Her brother and
        sister-in-law live in Almaty. The couple is tearing apart and Chouga’s
        brother requests her to come and try to bring them back together. There
        she meets Ablaï, a rich and idle young man whom she strongly feels
        attracted to. Once back to Astana, Chouga tries to withstand this
        sensual attraction about which she has a premonition of a tragic
        outcome.</image:caption
