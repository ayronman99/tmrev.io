        >DHL Founder and billionaire Larry Hillblom seemed to have vanished into
        thin air when he failed to return from a routine flight in his vintage
        Seabee over the Pacific. After his disappearance, a dark side of Larry
        emerged. Even before he was officially declared dead, bar girls
        throughout Southeast Asia came forward claiming to have had children by
        Larry and seeking a piece of his vast fortune. BILLIONAIRE unravels the
        secretive and scandalous life of this enigmatic and reclusive tycoon.
        The battle over his estate took on epic proportions, pitting
        impoverished, teenage prostitutes against Larry's former business
        associates and several of the largest law firms in the world. In the end
        it is a David and Goliath story, as a surprising hero emerges to
        untangle the web and discover the startling truth.</image:caption
