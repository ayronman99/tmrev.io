        >Author Jean Dorset has suffered from a bad case of writer's block since
        his first novel became a bestseller. He lives in a small apartment in
        Paris with his wife Michelle and, in spite of their ostensible success,
        the couple are having trouble making ends meet. One day they receive the
        utterly unexpected news that they are the sole inheritors of a wealthy
        neighbor, M. Guillemet, whom they have never met. Guillemet has left
        them his old townhouse along with all of his belongings, but with two
        conditions -- the first is that the dead man's papers be left untouched,
        and the second is that his live-in maid Clemence Richbourg remain
        employed at the estate. The Dorsets soon learn why they were the
        recipients of such strange generosity. Guillemet had set up a camera
        with a massive zoom lens pointing to their bedroom window. The couple is
        shocked and disgusted, but not enough to give up their new tony
        digs.</image:caption
