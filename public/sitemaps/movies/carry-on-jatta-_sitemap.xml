        >Carry on Jatta 2 picks up the fun where Carry on Jatta ends. The story
        follows Jass, an orphan, but a happy-go-lucky guy whose sole purpose in
        life is to go to Canada by any means possible. After numerous attempts
        of going to Canada and many taunts faced from his landlord, Advocate
        Dhillon and his best friend Goldy, Jass decides that marrying a Canadian
        girl is the only way he can fulfil his dream. Jass appoints his friend
        Honey to the task, who then introduces him to Meet an NRI. Jass succeeds
        in wooing Meet but the confusion begins to rise as he learns more about
        the particular qualities Meet wants in her future husband. What kind of
        tricks and sticky situations do Jass, Goldy and Honey get themselves
        into throughout the quest of fulfilling Jass's Canadian
        dream?</image:caption
