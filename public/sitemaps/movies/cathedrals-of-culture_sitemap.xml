        >"If buildings could talk, what would they say about us?" CATHEDRALS OF
        CULTURE offers six startling responses. This 3D film project about the
        soul of buildings allows six iconic and very different buildings to
        speak for themselves, examining human life from the unblinking
        perspective of a manmade structure. Six acclaimed filmmakers bring their
        own visual style and artistic approach to the project. Buildings, they
        show us, are material manifestations of human thought and action: the
        Berlin Philharmonic, an icon of modernity; the National Library of
        Russia, a kingdom of thoughts; Halden Prison, the world's most humane
        prison; the Salk Institute, an institute for breakthrough science; the
        Oslo Opera House, a futuristic symbiosis of art and life; and the Centre
        Pompidou, a modern culture machine. CATHEDRALS OF CULTURE explores how
        each of these landmarks reflects our culture and guards our collective
        memory.</image:caption
