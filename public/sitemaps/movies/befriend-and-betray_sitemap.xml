        >Criminal organizations succeed by enforcing a strict code of trust and
        loyalty. To penetrate these organizations and gain access to their inner
        circles the police need a magic bullet. Alex Caine is that magic bullet.
        Only thirty years old, Alex, who grew up hard on the mean streets of
        Montreal, already brings a lifetime’s worth of experience (foster care,
        military service, prison time) to the world’s most dangerous occupation:
        professional gang infiltrator. It is his job to befriend criminals,
        participate in their illegal activities, gather evidence – then live
        long enough to testify against them in court.</image:caption
