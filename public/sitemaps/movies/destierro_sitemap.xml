        >Leo and Marie are having marital problems because the woman is spending
        too much time with her pet dogs. This prompts Leo, the art director of
        ad agency, to have a one-night stand. Marie then confronts her husband
        about his infidelity and plots her own revenge. Another couple
        experiencing marital problems featured in the movie is composed of Gabby
        and Rita. The husband has to deal with premature ejaculation but Rita
        doesn't mind at all. That is until she meets the very aggressive Gaston
        (a married meat vendor) who awakens her appetite for lust and forbidden
        passion.</image:caption
