        >Successful and married with children, paper-mill owner Jihei knows
        better than to contradict the strict social and moral codes of
        18th-century Japan. But when he meets the lovely courtesan Koharu, he
        becomes a man obsessed. Koharu returns his love, even foregoing other
        customers while Jihei schemes to somehow buy her freedom. His efforts
        yield ruinous consequences for his business and his family life, and
        Koharu is meanwhile purchased by another client.</image:caption
