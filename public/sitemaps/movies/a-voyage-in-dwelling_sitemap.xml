        >The films register as an uneasy mapping of female desire, as they chart
        the slippage between one woman's actual and imagined sexual self. Just
        sensitively explores the idea that "the received paradigm of a man's
        journey is that he always returns to the point of departure expecting to
        find his home and wife unchanged, unaffected. Benedikte's experience, by
        contrast, is one of pleasurable displacement - she becomes a nomad in
        her own mind, never returning to her former status quo." Shot on a
        remote island and on a dilapidated Polish ferry, the trilogy also
        features an original soundtrack by Theremin composer Dorit Chrysler and
        American transgender singer/songwriter, Baby Dee.</image:caption
