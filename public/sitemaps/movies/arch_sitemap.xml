        >The greatest accolade the North Melbourne Football Club could bestow
        sits comfortably upon the broad shoulders of Glenn Archer. There may
        have been greater talents who wore the royal blue and white of the
        Kangaroos but none have come close to epitomising thr never-say-die
        attitude of this mighty player. As Glenn Archer bowed out of football at
        the end of the 2007 season, he was lauded by every section of the
        football world. He had played more games for the Kangaroos than any
        other. He had played in Premierships and been voted the Norm Smith
        Medallist in the game that matters the most - the Grand Final. The Glenn
        Archer story is one of resilience, of courage under fire. 'Arch' was
        simply the greatest shinboner of them all.</image:caption
