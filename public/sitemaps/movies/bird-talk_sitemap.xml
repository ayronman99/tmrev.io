        >Based on a script by Andrzej Żuławski, this is a fascinating on-screen
        dialogue between father and son that combines nostalgia and fury, the
        sublime with humor, and old-school style with a sharp, penetrating look
        at Polish reality. The eponymous bird talk is the language used by those
        excluded from the aggressive majority: a history teacher tormented by
        children, a teacher of Polish studies fired from his job, a girl who
        cleans a banker’s villa, a florist with a club foot and a student with a
        fascination for cinema. Pushed to the margins by the extreme right, they
        defend themselves with irony, songs and quotes from the
        classics.</image:caption
