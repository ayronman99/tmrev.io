        >Kenny Crawford arrives in Dunwich after hearing that his brother Andrew
        has been admitted to a psychiatric ward, and is suspected in a string of
        disappearances in the town. With the help of local reporter Marsha
        Calloway and the eccentric Upton Armitage he probes the last few weeks
        of his brother's life. As they do so, they uncover evidence of a plot in
        the works revolving around Andrew, his girlfriend Nikki Hartwell and her
        twisted friend Otto Bellinger.</image:caption
