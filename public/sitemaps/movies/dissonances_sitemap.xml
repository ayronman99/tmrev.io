        >Nat drives on the interstate with his two young daughters in the back
        seats, when a car drives by and an unknown guy shoots one of his
        daughters dead for no reason. Nat's life is shattered. He becomes
        obsessed with finding the killers, assaults two men, kills one, goes to
        jail, is left by his wife, grows old estranged from his other daughter.
        We see the action first through Nat's eyes, then via Brautigan, the cop
        in charge of the investigation, and finally from the perspective of the
        remaining daughter Margo. The deconstructed narrative echoes the chaos
        within Nat and emphasizes the fact that the characters are out of tune
        with one another, which is the meaning of the original
        title.</image:caption
