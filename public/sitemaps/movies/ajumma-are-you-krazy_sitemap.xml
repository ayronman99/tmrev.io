        >AJUMMA! Are you krazy??? is a zany comedy that follows the
        misadventures of three Korean drama fanatics. Fueled by their schoolgirl
        hormones, the hopelessly romantic Ajummas, Judy (Thea Matsuda), the
        lovable and innocent heroine, Susan (Tessie Magaoay) the gruff-tough
        one, and Amy (Cari Mizumoto) the sassy tart, go on a hilarious journey
        to try and meet Korean super star Michael Park (Michael Hsia) by
        stealing his itinerary, breaking into his hotel room, and sneaking on to
        his music video set. Witty writing, a light-hearted story and a likable
        cast allow this short film to succeed in taking a humorous look at the
        K-drama phenomenon and what some ladies will do for a
        crush.</image:caption
