        >This heartwarming and at times touching documentary chronicles the
        preparation, experience, and aftermath of the University of Nebraska at
        Omaha's Black Studies Department, students, and community persons as
        they embark upon the inauguration of President Barack Obama. A mixture
        of cinema verity and interview, this documentary provides an eyewitness
        accounting of the event through emerging primary stories representative
        of a broad array of cultural and occupational backgrounds. It is the
        cinematic documentation of the joy, the laughter, and the tears as 55
        passengers board a bus and travel over 2,000 miles for an experience of
        a lifetime.</image:caption
