        >The unexplainable phenomenon known as Colony Collapse Disorder has left
        landscapes of empty beehives all across the US, threatening not only the
        beekeeping industry but our food supply. As scientists and beekeepers
        search for the cause, Colony captures the struggle within the beekeeping
        community to save the honeybee and themselves. Colony documents a time
        of unprecedented crisis in the world of the honeybee through the eyes of
        both veteran beekeeper, David Mendes, and Lance and Victor Seppi, two
        young brothers getting into beekeeping when most are getting out. As
        Mendes tries to save the nation's collapsing hives, the Seppi's try to
        keep their business alive amidst a collapsing economy.</image:caption
