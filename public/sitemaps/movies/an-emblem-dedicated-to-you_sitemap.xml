        >Kazuya Takajo was a promising soccer player. At the age of 23, he was
        selected for the national A football team and he bought a house to live
        with his fianc√© Miki Nakagawa. One day, Kazuya Takajo gets into a car
        accident and becomes paralyzed and falls into deep despair. Kazuya goes
        through rehab on the strength of his wife's love. Yet, he becomes
        frustrated by those opposed to his marriage with Miki and others who
        give him pity looks. He also can't find anything to replace soccer in
        his life. Kazuya then witnesses a wheelchair basketball game at a
        gym.</image:caption
