        >At 21, Chris Birch was a typical, burly, rugby playing lad with a
        girlfriend and a job in a bank, but after a stroke everything changed.
        Today Chris looks different, sounds different and has a completely
        different life - he is a gay, image conscious hairdresser interested in
        fashion and interior d√©cor. Chris has lost touch with some former
        friends and family and cannot recall many of the details of his life
        before the stroke. This film follows Chris as he gets to grips with his
        new life and his new personality, tries to discover who he used to be
        and attempts to build bridges with some of the people he has lost touch
        with.</image:caption
