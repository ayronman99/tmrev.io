        >UN statistics say that there are more than 5000 women and girls killed
        by their own family members for the sake of their honor for reasons like
        westernizing, falling in love and getting married by their own choice to
        partners outside their castes and religions, engaging in homosexual acts
        and a lot more. They happen all over the world. Though there are
        approximate statistics of the lives lost there are no statistics of
        people who have spend their lives with the burden of guilt of killing
        their loved ones for the sake of their family honor.</image:caption
