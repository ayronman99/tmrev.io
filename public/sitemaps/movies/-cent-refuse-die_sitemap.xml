        >50 Cent: Refuse to Die documents the early life and the subsequent
        successful career of the rap star 50 Cent. The documentary, by New Line
        Productions, showcases how the rapper lost none of his substantial
        street cred even as he began to socialize with the most famous people in
        the world. The film consists of interviews with people who knew him in
        his pre-fame days, as well as those who were with him when he began to
        see the rewards of his music career. This film was released to video the
        day before 50 Cent's biopic Get Rich or Die Tryin' opened in
        theaters.</image:caption
