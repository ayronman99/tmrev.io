        >This 74 minute documentary captures the film's beginnings on
        storyboards and goes through every creative step. No interviews, no
        observations, no recalling memories. There's just footage of whatever
        happened as it was happening: it takes the viewer from initial concept
        to casting, rehearsals, costume fittings, creating disfigured bodies,
        dialogue replacement, editing, composing... If that's not enough, there
        are, on the same DVD, shorter segments on the creation of 1920s Paris
        and the zeppelin explosion.</image:caption
