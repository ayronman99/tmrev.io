        >Gatling Pictures' "Cure for Pain: The Mark Sandman Story" examines the
        life and work of Mark Sandman, deceased frontman of Boston "low rock"
        band Morphine. From his Newton, Mass., roots to his travels across
        America and around the globe, Sandman left an indelible imprint as one
        of the most distinctive musicians of his generation. Along with
        revisiting the "unique and sultry sound" of his music, the film explores
        the meaning of family through this critically praised and personally
        conflicted singer, songwriter and innovative
        instrumentalist.</image:caption
