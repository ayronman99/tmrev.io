        >Bezhin Lug (Bezhin Meadow) was to be a Soviet film about a young farm
        boy whose father attempts to betray the government for political reasons
        by sabotaging the year's harvest, and the son's efforts to stop his own
        father to protect the Soviet state, culminating in the boy's murder and
        a social uprising. Assigned to Soviet film-maker Sergei Eisenstein, the
        filming followed the same path as with his previous effort, "Que Viva
        Mexico", into cost overrun and over-shooting of footage. Furthermore,
        Eisenstein's usage of forbidden experimental film techniques outraged
        his government superiors, who ordered the film destroyed before it was
        even completed. All that survives are the first and last frames of each
        shot, preserved by Sergei Eisensteinâ€™s wife, Pera Atasheva. The 1967
        reconstruction, by Naum Kleiman of the Eisenstein Museum and Sergei
        Yutkevich of Gosfilmofond, places these frames in order, approximating
        the original film.</image:caption
