        >Olga, a girl around 25, comes to Madrid from the village she used to
        live in with her father, in order to have a new start in life. Her
        father suffers from a deep depression since her mother died, and she
        does all she can to help him. She works with advertising, and starts as
        an assistant, in an agency. In no time, she's doing her own creations.
        But the sexual harassment from an important client, her colleagues' envy
        and her own ambition lead her to jail.</image:caption
