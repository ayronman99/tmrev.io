        >This is the retelling of the events of the weekend of April 23rd 2004.
        Three young, sexy girls go into the woods on a camping trip to a family
        cabin. The local forest Ranger had warned them about an old Hermit who
        lives in the woods, so when two young, great looking guys show up, the
        girls are nervous. Anxiety turns to attraction after they get to know
        each other. The next day, someone is still watching them. The Hermit
        shows up and threatens them, telling them to leave or die. That night,
        the gruesome murders begin and we realize that the victims are little
        more than food for this Ã’watcher in the woods. Snares, long sharp
        knives, bear traps and branches all make for perfect ways to end the
        lives of these young adults who are camping on haunted ground. In the
        end, the line between friendship and terror is blurred when we realize
        the murderer is an evil spirit who befriends then murders his
        prey.</image:caption
