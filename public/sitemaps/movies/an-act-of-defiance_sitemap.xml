        >Apartheid is rampant in South Africa, 1963. When ten men are arrested
        on a farm in Rivonia for conspiring to commit sabotage and violent acts
        against the repressive S. African government, tenacious lawyer Bram
        Fisher steps up to the challenge as lead counsel. He soon finds that
        political leader Nelson Mandela is also on trial. Mandela urges his
        fellow defendants to plead not guilty and shine light on the systemic
        corruption against the African people. As the outcome of the trial looks
        bleak, Mandela gives his famous "I'm Prepared to Die" speech, discussing
        how the ANC's resistance is justified. But will Mandela's impassioned
        speech save these men's lives?</image:caption
