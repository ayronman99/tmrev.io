        >17-year- old Lena falls in love with Eva, her older brother's new
        girlfriend. With a lot of witty dialogue "Between Summer and Fall" tells
        the story of how two people slowly grow close to each other even though
        they were not looking for love. The film paints a picture of two young
        women caught between their own insecurity and their desire for a
        connection and a place in the world.</image:caption
