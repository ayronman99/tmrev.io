        >An attempt at depicting the life of a generation born and raised in
        communist Poland; a generation that lived through all the stages of that
        system and made it to democracy. Throughout his life, the film's
        protagonist has always tried to be active, but something always got in
        his way, either through an absurd coincidence, as a result of his own
        lack of ability, or due to the unpredictable nature of certain events in
        our recent history.</image:caption
