        >On the glorious battlefields of the American Revolution, two great
        generals distinguished themselves; George Washington and Benedict
        Arnold. Washington is remembered as America's founding father, Arnold as
        America's most notorious traitor. Benedict Arnold rose from humble
        origins to become the most respected and feared of America's generals.
        He won brilliant military victories against the English colonists and
        was Washington's favorite soldier. But two conflicting forces battled
        inside Arnold's heart; a deep concern for his country and his passionate
        love for an enchanting and manipulative English woman, Peggy Shippen.
        Blinded by desire, Arnold defected to the English army, orchestrating an
        attempt to assassinate his own mentor, George Washington.</image:caption
