        >Twelve-year-old Binti was born in the Congo but has lived with her
        father Jovial in Belgium since she was a baby. Despite not having any
        legal documents, Binti wants to live a normal life, and dreams of
        becoming a famous vlogger like her idol Tatyana. Elias (11) runs his
        'save-the-okapi-club' without the help of his father, who's moved to
        Brazil following his divorce with Elias’s mother Christine. When their
        annoying neighbour invites Christine on a romantic trip to Paris, Elias,
        upset and angry, runs away to his treehouse. At the same time, police
        raid Binti and Jovial’s home, sending the two on the run, and Binti into
        the path of Elias. When their parents meet shortly after, Binti quickly
        sees the perfect solution to all her problems. If she can match her dad
        with Elias’ mom, they can get married and stay in
        Belgium.</image:caption
