        >Brick and Mortar and Love follows the story of ear X-tacy Records, the
        legendary record store in Louisville, Kentucky, as it struggles to
        survive in the changing music retail industry. In-depth interviews
        include owner John Timmons, staff at ear X-tacy, leaders in the record
        store industry and scores of independent record store owners from all
        over the US. These interviews look into the state of the independent
        record store, what services they provide and what is at stake if they
        disappear. Independent record stores are not just the place to buy a CD,
        they are cultural centers where music is learned, art is cultivated and
        they are vitally important to the communities that they
        serve.</image:caption
