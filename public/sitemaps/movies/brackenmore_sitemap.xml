        >The close-knit community of Brackenmore is harboring a secret. After
        the untimely death of an uncle she never knew she had, Kate (Sophie
        Hopkins) is forced to return to her ancestral home, a tiny rural village
        in the South of Ireland. Soon after her arrival she meets Tom (D.J.
        McGrath), a mysterious young local who helps her to rediscover her
        long-neglected roots and forget about the anxieties of her life in
        London. The longer Kate stays in Brackenmore, the more she begins to
        realize that the eccentricities of its self-protective residents, may be
        more ominous than she first thought and the secluded family estate is
        harboring a dark and ancient secret. From the opening scenes of a
        fateful car crash to the shocking ending Brackenmore weaves its ways
        under your skin shifting between classic horror to the mysteries of the
        occult. Cinematographer Justin McCarthy keeps a steady hand as he
        captures the silent fear that begins to grow as Hopkins uncovers the
        dark horror that is Brackenmore.</image:caption
