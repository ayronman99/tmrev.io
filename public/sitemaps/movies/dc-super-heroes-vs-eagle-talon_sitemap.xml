        >Joker has come to Japan to steal the Eagle Talon Society's secret
        weapons in his continued scheme for pure chaos. However, the Justice
        League is on his trail, but there's something off with Batman. Now, it's
        up to Eagle Talon to go find out what's wrong with Batman, and that
        means going back in time to Bruce Wayne's most traumatic experience, the
        murder of his parents. If that wasn't enough to worry about, the Eagle
        Talon Society also have to keep their eyes on their production budget,
        especially with most of that money going towards the licensing fee for
        DC's popular characters. Will the Eagle Talon Society and the Justice
        League be able to stop the Joker before their budget dries up, and
        they're reduced to simple stick figures!?</image:caption
