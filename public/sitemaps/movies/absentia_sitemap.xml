        >Tricia's husband Daniel has been missing for seven years. Her younger
        sister Callie comes to live with her as the pressure mounts to finally
        declare him 'dead in absentia.' As Tricia sifts through the wreckage and
        tries to move on with her life, Callie finds herself drawn to an ominous
        tunnel near the house. As she begins to link it to other mysterious
        disappearances, it becomes clear that Daniel's presumed death might be
        anything but 'natural.' The ancient force at work in the tunnel might
        have set its sights on Callie and Triciaâ€”and Daniel might be suffering a
        fate far worse than death in its grasp.</image:caption
