        >It is the largest movement the world has ever seen, it may also be the
        most important - in terms of what's at stake. Yet it's not east being

        killjoys and Cassandras. Every battle begins as a lost cause and even
        the victories have to be fought for again and again. Still,
        environmentalism is one of the great social innovations of the twentieth
        century, and one of the keys to the twenty-first. It has arisen at a key
        juncture in history, when humans have come to rival nature as a power
        determining the fate of the earth.</image:caption
