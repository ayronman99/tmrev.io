        >It's Christmas, and Angelina Mouseling (Finty Williams) is auditioning
        for the lead role in the musical extravaganza, Cinderella Mouse and the
        Ugly Whiskers. She is devastated when Penelope Pinkpaws (Jonell Elliott)
        is chosen to play Cinderella and she is cast as the Wicked Stepmouse.
        Taking Miss Lilly's (Dame Judi Dench's) advice to "think horrid" much
        too literally, Angelina storms off in a fit of a temper. Then a toboggan
        race goes wrong and it seems that the production will have to be
        cancelled. Realizing how selfish she has been, Angelina determines to
        sort things out, because as every aspiring star knows, "The Show Must Go
        On".</image:caption
