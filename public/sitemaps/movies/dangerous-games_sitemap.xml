        >In a small house with oversized furniture, located in a rice field in
        Asia, some children wearing army clothes and weapons, start playing war,
        creating between each other two armies and using children's toys, laser
        weapons, machine guns and helicopters. Slowly, as the game progresses,
        they start imitating war scenes as seen on TV, such as negotiations and
        death scenes. At the end of the film, the children are coming out of the
        house and they deposit their weapons in front of it. The smallest child
        comes out in the end with a burning bramble stick in his hand and lights
        the pile of weapons. All the children leave while the pile is burning.
        In over twenty countries around the world, children are direct
        participants in war. Denied a childhood and often subjected to horrific
        violence, an estimated 200,000 to 300,000 children are serving as
        soldiers for both rebel groups and government forces in current armed
        conflicts. Dangerous Games is a work of fiction.</image:caption
