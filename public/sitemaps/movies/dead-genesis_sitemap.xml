        >Seven months have passed since the dead took over. Many cities and
        states have been abandoned and left to die. Several self sufficient
        hunting groups have been established to take on the threat in a war
        aptly referred to as the 'War on Dead'. Jillian Hurst, a former news
        writer and amateur documentarian, has set out to make a pro-war
        propaganda film to support the W.O.D. She joins up with a pack of
        renegade hunters known infamously to North America as 'the deadheads'.
        The moral dynamics and hardships of fighting in a war against the undead
        are told from several different perspectives.</image:caption
