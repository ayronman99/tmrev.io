        >Mentally ill. Deviant. Diseased. And in need of a cure. These were
        among the terms psychiatrists used to describe gay women and men in the

        waged by a small group of activists who declared war against a
        formidable institution – and won a crucial victory in the modern
        movement for LGBTQIA+ equality.</image:caption
