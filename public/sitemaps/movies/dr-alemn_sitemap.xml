        >Marc, an unexperienced medical doctor from Germany arrives at the
        Hospital Universitario del Valle in Cali, Colombia for his internship
        and soon finds himself in-between a raging gang war in Siloé, a Cali
        barrio. In the hospital he has to care mostly for shotgun wounds, while
        in the streets he falls in love with a stall-holder who cares for some
        of the children involved in drug trafficking and criminal violence.
        Alienating his colleagues and his host family while befriending the
        kids, he soon finds himself trapped in the center of the violent
        conflict between the gangs and has to come to a decision.</image:caption
