        >It’s 2017 in Bisbee, Arizona, an old copper-mining town just miles from
        the Mexican border. The town’s close-knit community prepares to
        commemorate the 100th anniversary of Bisbee’s darkest hour: the infamous
        Bisbee Deportation of 1917, during which 1,200 striking miners were
        violently taken from their homes, banished to the middle of the desert,
        and left to die. Townspeople confront this violent, misunderstood past
        by staging dramatic recreations of the escalating strike. These
        dramatized scenes are based on subjective versions of the story and
        “directed,” in a sense, by residents with conflicting views of the
        event. Deeply personal segments torn from family history build toward a
        massive restaging of the deportation itself on the exact day of its
        100th anniversary.</image:caption
