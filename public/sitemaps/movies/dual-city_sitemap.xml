        live a peaceful life, while conflicts are going on in the North. For
        Yoriko, a nurse in the North, her sole consolation is to visit where she
        can access her late daughter’s lifetime information. One day, Yoriko is
        abducted, but she learns that dead individual’s total memories are
        preserved as in the South,a nd that her daughter is still alive in that
        form.</image:caption
