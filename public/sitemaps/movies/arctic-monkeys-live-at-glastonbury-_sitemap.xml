        >The Arctic Monkeys don't do ad-libbing, they don't do crowd
        interaction, and they don't do encores. A lot of people don't like them
        as a live act for this very reason, but if there are any disappointed
        punters in the crowd tonight, then they're keeping quiet. It takes a
        certain kind of band to move every member of the audience at the main
        stage; but everyone from the front row all the way back to the tents is
        on their feet, delighted and singing in anticipation, even before the
        Monkeys begin.</image:caption
