        >The Yildiz brothers - Celal, Sami and Mesut - still live under one roof
        - despite their differences. The family bridal shop is doing really
        badly and they each yearn for a different life: Heartthrob Celal pines
        for his ex-girlfriend Anna and risks every last cent of their family
        inheritance for his dream of a mobile phone shop. Sami is searching for
        true love but ruins every blind date with his anger mis-management. And
        Mesut, the youngest of the three, tries to combine a cool music career
        with his strict adherence to the Koran. So when a sweet little baby
        comes careering into their lives, nothing is as it was before. The three
        young Turkish bachelors are given a crash course in
        responsibility.</image:caption
