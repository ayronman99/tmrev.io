        >A firsthand account of the extraordinary efforts of ordinary
        Venezuelans to reclaim their democracy from the dictatorship of Nicolás
        Maduro, whose corrupt and brutal policies have plunged the country into
        economic ruin. Working with a network of clandestine camera crews, the
        filmmakers spent three years recording exclusive interviews with key
        opposition figures including Leopoldo López and grassroots activist
        Nixon Leal, as well as a host of everyday citizens, and captured the
        remarkable courage of the Venezuelan people as they unite to restore
        liberty to their country.</image:caption
