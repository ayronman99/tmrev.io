        >In the forgotten corners of rural Virginia, Sheryl struggles to balance
        her work as a housekeeper and raising her two sons, fifteen year-old
        Marc and eleven year-old Stephen. Hoping to meet the love of her life
        and bring home a father for her boys, she frequents a depressing, weekly
        mixer for the towns aging singles set. Meanwhile, Marc is desperate to
        lose his virginity, and spends his days working at a used car lot. And
        his brother Stephen, in the throes of sexual discovery, becomes
        infatuated with his school teacher while hoping to win the approval of a
        group of peers who adamantly detest her.</image:caption
