        You director Robin Lee Yun Chan's latest urban fairy tale Dancing
        Without You. The theatrical version of a mini-series exhibited
        exclusively in metro stations in Mainland China, the whimsical romance
        drama is an inspiring and humorous tale of love, dreams, and dancing.
        The film also features the supporting appearances of Taiwan and Hong
        Kong stars like Tammy Chen, Gabriel Lan, Joelle Lu, Michael Tong, and
        Eileen Tung. On the eve of the premiere of Swan Lake, ballet dancer Xia
        Xuan (Vivian Hsu) is forced to withdraw from the troupe after spraining
        her ankle. Losing all hope, the dejected dancer strays into the forest
        by the lakeside. Just when she is about to attempt suicide, a young
        truck driver named Ludi (Tony Yang) pops out in front of her. Full of
        fanciful ideas, Ludi mistakes Xia Xuan for an alien and brings her home,
        taking care of her and rekindling her passion in life...</image:caption
