        >Chinna (Vishnu) is a very witty and resourceful person who knows how to
        get things done. As kids, Chinna and Piccheshwar (Vennela Kishore) have
        a tiff and Piccheshwar leaves the village in a huff. Piccheshwar’s
        outraged grandfather (Kota Srinivasa Rao) orders the execution of
        Chinna’s family, forcing them to flee as well. As the years go by,
        Chinna grows into a tall and fearless young fellow. He applies for a job
        as a journalist and he is sent on an assignment by his boss Avatar
        (Posani). The assignment is to conduct a sting operation on Minister
        Dilleeswara Rao (Pankaj Tripathi). Chinna succeeds in capturing
        incriminating footage, but he is caught and thrashed by the minister’s
        goons.</image:caption
