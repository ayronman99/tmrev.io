        >Atomic Mom is a feature length documentary about two women, both
        mothers, who have very different experiences of the atom bomb. One is my
        mother, Pauline Silvia, who was a Navy biologist in the early 1950's and
        was sent to the Nevada Test Site where she witnessed five detonations.
        After decades of silence, she is in a crisis of conscience about the
        work she did. The other woman is Emiko Okada, a Hiroshima survivor who
        was eight years old when the bomb was dropped. Knowing the work that
        Pauline did, Emiko offers her an olive branch with a beautifully potent
        message of peace.</image:caption
