        >Mr. Ozaki, a Japanese conglomerate businessman living in Los Angeles,
        hires a beautiful young double (Maria) to protect his real daughter
        (Lisa) from harm. When Maria is kidnapped by a professional crime
        organization for a $2 million ransom, her bodyguard, Luke Campbell,
        conceives a plan to rescue her. By kidnapping the real Lisa Ozaki and
        turning her over to the kidnappers, Luke hopes to save Maria, and
        ultimately Lisa, as he knows her father will only pay the ransom for his
        daughter and not the double. However, the bodyguards hired to watch Lisa
        have another plan in mind. About to lose their jobs for losing Lisa when
        they were supposed to keep an eye on her at all times, they decide to
        steal the ransom money and rescue Lisa, in an attempt to be the heroes
        and save their jobs</image:caption
