        >In 1989, six year old Martin Bristoll was kidnapped from his backyard
        swing in Minersville Pennsylvania. Graham Sutter, a psychotic recluse,
        kept Martin imprisoned on his derelict pig farm, forcing him to witness
        and participate in unspeakable horrors. Chosen at random, his victim's
        screams were drowned out by the rural countryside. For five years,
        Martin's whereabouts have remained a mystery, until 17 year old Allison
        Miller comes to live with her Uncle, Jonathan. While exploring her new
        surroundings, Allison discovers things aren't quite right at the
        farmhouse down the road. Her curiosity disturbs a hornet's nest of evil
        and despair that once torn open, can never be closed.</image:caption
