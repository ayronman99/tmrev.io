        >College student Asako falls in love at first sight with Baku after
        meeting at a photography exhibit. Romance sparks between the two but
        doesn't last long when Baku suddenly disappears from her life. Two years
        later, she spots a man that bears a striking resemblance to him. Even
        though it is only his physical similarities to Baku that attracted her
        to him, she doesn't say so and starts dating the soft-spoken young man
        called Ryohei.</image:caption
