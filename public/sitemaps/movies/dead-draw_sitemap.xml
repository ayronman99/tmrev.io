        >25 million dollars, 8 safety deposit boxes, and months before anyone
        will know it’s gone. But Harrison’s perfect heist turns deadly when his
        safe-cracker, Mack, discovers their getaway pilot brutally murdered.
        Someone knew about the job, someone set them up. Stranded in a frozen
        hangar, held hostage by someone outside, loyalty turns to suspicion and
        friends turn to enemies. Now it’s a race against time as the band of
        thieves try to uncover the rat and escape their troubled pasts…if they
        can survive the night.</image:caption
