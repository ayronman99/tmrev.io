        >After years of rotting in Joliet, Les, a wrongfully imprisoned street
        legend known as "The Ghoul", is released into a mad search through
        Chicago's back alleys for the man who slaughtered his mother and robbed
        him of his soul. Aided by mysterious benefactors, he must delve beneath
        the city into a modern labyrinth of gutters whose tendrils have grown
        deep while he was gone. What unfolds is a desperate tale of brute force
        tragedy set in the supernatural underworld of Chicago, where heroes are
        reduced to horror-shows, villains dream of their own demise, and good
        and evil prove to be antiquated concepts.</image:caption
