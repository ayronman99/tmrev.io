        >Bellator 178: Straus vs. Pitbull 4 took place on April 21, 2017 at
        Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville, Connecticut . The event aired live on
        Spike TV. Bellator returned to Mohegan Sun with a Featherweight world
        title fight pitting Daniel Straus against Patricio "Pitbull" Freire as
        the main event of Bellator 178. Straus and Freire have fought three
        times before; Freire won one by submission and once by decision, while
        Straus most recently won by decision. A middleweight bout between Ed
        Ruth and Aaron Goodwine was originally scheduled for this card, but
        failed to materialize. Ruth instead faced David Mundell.</image:caption
