        >Football is everything to Kam who has lived near the Ainsworth Estate
        pitch all his life. In 2013, with his good friend Hassan, Kam approached
        the Arsenal Foundation to resurface the pitch from concrete to
        astroturf. He is now a Coach to the local kids and this area represents
        so much more than just a playing field. It is the beating heart of the
        Estate and football the international language that binds the entire
        community together.</image:caption
