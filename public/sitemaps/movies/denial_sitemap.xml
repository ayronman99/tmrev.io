        >Every day our changing climate pushes us closer to an environmental
        catastrophe, but for most the problem is easy to ignore. David
        Hallquist, a Vermont utility executive, has made it his mission to take
        on one of the largest contributors of this global crisis-our electric
        grid. But when his son Derek tries to tell his father's story, the film
        is soon derailed by a staggering family secret, one that forces Derek
        and David to turn their attention toward a much more personal struggle,
        one that can no longer be ignored. - Written by Aaron
