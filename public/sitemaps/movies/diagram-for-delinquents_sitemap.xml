        >In 1950, America was in a state of panic. Juvenile delinquency was
        destroying the very fabric of society. Ninety percent of all children
        were reading comic books. In 1954, psychiatrist Dr. Fredric Wertham
        wrote a scathing indictment of comics called Seduction of the Innocent.
        Its central premise: Comic books were the leading contributing factor to
        juvenile delinquency. That same year, Dr. Wertham testified at special
        hearings on comic books at the Senate Subcommittee to Investigate
        Juvenile Delinquency in the United States. Comics were on trial. Diagram
        for Delinquents captures the zeitgeist of late 1940s and early 1950s
        America and investigates how the funny books found themselves on the
        fire. Using expert and comic book insider interviews, never seen before
        historical photographs and films, and animation, DIAGRAM goes further
        than any previous comic book documentary to explore and understand the
        controversial figure at the center of this American tale: Fredric
        Wertham.</image:caption
