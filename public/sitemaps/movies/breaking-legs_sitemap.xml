        >It's 'Footloose' meets 'Mean Girls' as high school freshman Bloom moves
        to a town where there's no place to dance - except the school dance
        team! But when the boyfriend of the team's lead girl falls for her,
        she'll have to fight to win her place amongst these venomous girls.
        Breaking Legs is sure one to kick your boots off and pull up your heels,
        as these kids dance the field away to compete for the homecoming crown
        at R. Murray High School. Will it be newbie Bloom, or her arch nemesis
        and Dance Team leader, Harmony? Watch as the two square off in this fun
        but odd match to the finish. Someone is doomed to 'Break a Leg' on the
        dance floor, or rather, the football field!</image:caption
