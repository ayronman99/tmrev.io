        >Despite a 11-year age difference between them, Patrick Tse and
        Josephine Siao made up one of the most popular screen couples in the
        late 1960s. In this adaptation of Yee Tat's novel, Siao plays a decadent
        prostitute, initially disguised as a privileged heiress and later
        revealed to be a dutiful daughter. Equally impressive is Tse as a writer
        who stays by the heroine's side through thick and thin. Unlike most
        Cantonese films at the time, director Chor Yuen left the studio and
        chose to shoot much of the film in real locations, providing a real
        wintry look that fits the film's title perfectly.</image:caption
