        >In this one-off documentary, David Malone looks at four brilliant
        mathematicians – Georg Cantor, Ludwig Boltzmann, Kurt Gödel and Alan
        Turing – whose genius has profoundly affected us, but which tragically
        drove them insane and eventually led to them all committing suicide. The
        film also talks to the latest in the line of thinkers who have continued
        to pursue the question of whether there are things that mathematics and
        the human mind cannot know. Dangerous Knowledge tackles some of the
        profound questions about the true nature of reality that mathematical
        thinkers are still trying to answer today.</image:caption
