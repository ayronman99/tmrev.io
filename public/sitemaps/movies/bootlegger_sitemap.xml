        >Mani, a masterâ€™s student, returns to the reserve in northern Quebec
        where she grew up. Her painful past resurfaces. Resolved to reintegrate
        into the community, she gets involved in the debate around a referendum
        on allowing the free sale of alcohol on the reserve. Laura, a
        bootlegger, pockets the profits she makes there under the protection of
        the band council and her partner Raymond. The latter is still angry with
        Mani, whom he holds responsible for the death of his daughter in a fire.
        Opposing forces quickly divide the community into two sides who face
        each other to determine the best path to independence.</image:caption
