        >Rottenberg’s newest film, Cheese (2007), conflates farm-girl imagery
        with the fairy tale “Rapunzel” into a story loosely based on the
        Sutherland Sisters, renowned for their extremely long hair. Floating
        through a pastoral yet mazelike setting of raw wooden debris cobbled
        together into a benign shantytown, six longhaired women in flowing white
        nightgowns “milk” their locks and the goats they live with to generate
        cheese. Shots of animals crowded in pens and the sisters’ bunk bed–
        cluttered room visually compare the women to their ruminant allies. As
        nurturing caretakers, these women represent maternal aspects of Mother
        Nature. Here Rottenberg investigates feminine magic, the ability to
        “grow things out of the body” as she says, as the ultimate, wondrous
        physical mystery.</image:caption
