        >With his uncouth manner, Professor Pohl doesn’t enjoy the best
        reputation at the university where he works. To make matters worse, he
        makes a racist remark when student Naima arrives late for his lecture.
        Unfortunately for him, a video of his verbal outburst spreads like
        wildfire on the Internet, and the university’s president, Lambrecht, is
        called to deal with the incident. But Pohl is not dismissed. Instead, he
        is put to the task of helping Naima prepare for an important debating
        competition. The lecturer and the student could not be more different,
        yet they are thrown together to work as a team.</image:caption
