        >Unlike what history books tell us, Adolf Hitler did not commit suicide
        in his bunker, but instead fled to the African continent in his
        submarine. Teaming up with his new right hand, infamous Japanese
        military leader Hideki Tojo and the brutal Horse-Man GÃ¶ring, he plans on
        conquering the world once again - starting in Ghana. With the might of
        his loyal (although brainwashed) Ghan-Aryans and his superhuman
        Karate-Powers, Hitler destroys the African Kung-Fu school of the shadow
        snake, killing its leader. Grieving for his master, Kung-Fu disciple
        Addae seeks revenge by participating in Hitler's martial arts
        tournament. Will he find the strength of body and mind to defeat the
        evil dictator?</image:caption
