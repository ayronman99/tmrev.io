        >Based on the biography of Luiz Gama, one of the most important
        characters in Brazilian history, a black man who used the laws and
        courts to free more than 500 slaves. Born of a free womb, Gama was sold
        into slavery at the age of 10 to pay off his father's gambling debts.
        Even as a slave, he became literate, studied and earned his own freedom,
        becoming one of the most respected lawyers of his time. An abolitionist
        and republican who inspired an entire country.</image:caption
