        >In 1945, Japan surrendered to the United States and the Second World
        War was over. Right? Wrong. For eighty percent of the Japanese community
        in Brazil, Japan had won the war and defeat was nothing more than
        American propaganda. The few immigrants that accepted the truth were
        persecuted. Some were hunted down and assassinated - by their own
        countrymen - causing the start of a new, private war. Dirty Hearts is a
        thriller and love story told by the wife of one of the fanatics
        dedicated to preach Japanese victory. Little by little, she watches her
        husband, a hard-working immigrant, become an assassin and their love
        story fade away.</image:caption
