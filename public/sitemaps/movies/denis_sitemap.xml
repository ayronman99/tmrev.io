        >Twice Vincent thinks he has found the woman of his life. Twice his
        ideal woman left him for the same man: Denis. Now Vincent is pursuing a
        happy love affair with Anna, but he fears that history is about to

        about him that makes him so irresistible to the opposite sex - his taste
        in gaudy shirts or the fact that he teaches wrestling as if it were a
        philosophy?</image:caption
