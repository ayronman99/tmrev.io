        >Documentary in the traditions of Michael Apted's 7 Up, following the
        lives of a group of children in South Africa and offering an insight
        into life in a country that has gone through momentous change. In 1992,
        when they turned seven, Nelson Mandela had only been out of prison for
        two years. By the time they were 14, he had become their president and
        the regime of apartheid had been consigned to history. Chosen from
        separate communities, the six characters have had starkly differing life
        experiences.</image:caption
