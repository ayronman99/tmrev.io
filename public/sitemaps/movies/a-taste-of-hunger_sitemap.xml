        >Maggie and Carsten love each other, they have two wonderful children
        and run their own gourmet restaurant; Malus. They want it all. And they
        have it all. Almost. They are missing the coveted Michelin Star. It has
        been their dream, on which they gambled everything to win. One day
        Carsten receives a letter saying that his wife loves somebody else. But
        who sent the letter and why? In their continuous passion and pursuit for
        the ultimate recognition, they forget that the meals of life are best
        enjoyed together.</image:caption
