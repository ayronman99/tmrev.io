        >Filmed in one sequence-shot of 1 hour and 25 minutes, Ana Arabia is a
        moment in the life of a small community of outcasts, Jews and Arabs, who
        live together in a forgotten enclave at the “border” between Jaffa and
        Bat Yam, in Israel. One day, Yael, a young journalist, visits them. In
        these dilapidated shacks, in the orchard filled with lemon trees and
        surrounded by mass public houses, she discovers a range of characters
        far removed from the usual clichés offered by the region. Yael has the
        feeling of having discovered a human goldmine. She no longer thinks of
        her job. Faces and words of Youssef and Miriam, Sarah and Walid, of
        their neighbors, their friends tell her about life, its dreams and its
        hopes, its love affairs, desires and disillusions. Their relation to
        time is different than that of the city around them. In this tinkered
        and fragile place, there is a possibility of coexistence. A universal
        metaphor.</image:caption
