        >The recurring tone of an old filmstrip signals to the viewer the
        outmoded nature of the educational narration we hear about the native
        peoples of North America in this Janis Crystal Lipzin creation. It is
        just one authoritative voice in a collage soundtrack juxtaposed to
        Super-8mm footage that maps tourist images of the Southwest, Stonehenge
        and other candid "evidence" of civilizations present and past. Taking
        the smug yet also quaint manner of such instructional material as a
        starting point, American filmmaker Lipzin's 2004 film-on-video collage
        sets up a series of shrewd oppositions regarding our own understanding
        of ourselves. - Robert Avila</image:caption
