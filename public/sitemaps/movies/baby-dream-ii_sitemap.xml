        >The projected image is constructed from deteriorated colour film (old
        loops from the the installation Little Girl), the agitated rhythm of the
        movements of colour and form underscore the movement of the spectator
        and the rapid eye movement. To renforce the movement the film was edited
        in a series of mirco-loops, similar material was assembled to create a
        sense of progresssion and familiarity with the image, brief passages of
        figurative material were kept as a sort of visual conterpoint to the
        flow of the abstract colour sections. This duality of material seems to
        change the speed of the images we percieve a double dynamic dynamics
        produced within the same material.</image:caption
