        >It's Bernard's birthday, but he is not happy about it. In a strange
        world where adults are selfish and indifferent, his parents never
        accepted him as a child. Bernard doesn't want to grow up if it means to
        become like them. So he creates a suit that stops his growth. The day he
        reaches 10 years of age, Bernard will confront his parents and his whole
        world.</image:caption
