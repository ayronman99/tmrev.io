        >Get to know Spanish Surrealist master Salvador Dali in this volume,
        part of a series exploring some of the most important artists of the
        20th century. Learn about Dali's meteoric rise through the art world as
        a result of his visionary approach to art, and his subsequent
        difficulties as he was criticized for making art for the sake of money.
        A figure as colorful and unique as his paintings, Dali created art
        that's survived the march of time.</image:caption
