        >A story of an island country named Horai that was finally about to be
        integrated under one political administration. Domon DATE, an innocent
        man confined in a prison island. After 10 years of imprisonment, he kept
        his sanity by dreaming of retaliating against those who framed him up.
        He breaks the prison with the help of a man incarcerated in the deepest
        corner of the prison island. The man identified himself as Saji. His
        steady road to revenge was obstructed by a woman named Mikoto, the once
        fianc√©e of his. Can Domon get his revenge? Who is the man who identified
        himself as Saji? What are the hidden thoughts of Mikoto?</image:caption
