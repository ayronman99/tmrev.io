        >'9-Man' is an independent feature documentary about an isolated and
        exceptionally athletic Chinese-American sport that's much more than a
        pastime. Since the 1930s, young men have played this gritty streetball
        game competitively in the alleys and parking lots of Chinatown. At a
        time when anti-Chinese sentiment and laws like the Chinese Exclusion Act
        forced Chinese restaurant workers and laundrymen to socialize
        exclusively amongst themselves, nine-man offered both escape and
        fraternity for men who were separated from their families in China and
        facing extreme discrimination and distrust. Pivoting between oil-spotted
        Chinatown parking lots and jellyfish-filled banquet scenes, the film
        captures the spirit of nine-man as players not only battle for a
        championship but fight to preserve a sport that holds so much
        history.</image:caption
