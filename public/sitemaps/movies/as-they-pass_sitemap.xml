        >The introductory text of as they pass is spoken calmly and quietly. The
        voice doesn't tell a story, it conveys atmosphere. It´s superimposed
        over images that flare up briefly and are punctuated by relatively long
        intervals of black frames whenever the viewer begins to orient him or
        herself. And suddenly, the images in Bödenauer´s animation made with
        silk paint on glass - start to overlay one another: They´re arranged by
        layer, extending into the screen´s depths, and the uppermost layer flows
        apart, revealing the one below it. In the end they seem to have all
        moved away, their composition has turned into strips of color which zip
        upward or to the side. This is accompanied by an increasing volume of
        sound. At the film´s conclusion there is openness rather than a
        point.</image:caption
