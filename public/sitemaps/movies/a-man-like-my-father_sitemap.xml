        >Juan returns to Cape Town with his family from their life in England
        when he discovers his mother is dying. She insists she wants her
        conflicted son to reconcile with his alcoholic dad, but all the younger
        man remembers of his childhood is disappointment and shame and although
        he wants to be with his mother he intensely dislikes his father, though
        it's probably more a case of Juan hating who he is himself, because of
        his father.</image:caption
