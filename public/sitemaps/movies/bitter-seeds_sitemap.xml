        >A vibrant investigation of the predicament of central Indian cotton
        farmers, caught up in biotech broker Monsanto's genetically modified
        seed program. Refused loans by legitimate banks, the farmers borrow from
        illegal moneylenders at seven percent interest per month and inevitably
        fall into irredeemable debt, further aggravated by low yields and a need
        for more fertilizer and water. Out of shame, some commit suicide by
        drinking Monsanto’s pesticide – such deaths now number over 200,000. The
        tiny miracle in this seemingly hopeless globalization tragedy is the
        daughter of one such farmer, a council head who was the first in his
        village to kill himself. Eighteen-year-old Manjusha yearns to be a
        journalist to expose the reasons for the suicides, but she has no mentor
        and certainly no encouragement. Peled’s latest heroine fights on the
        frontline of this global human and environmental crisis, driven by a
        desire to voice the perspective and preserve the dignity of the
        powerless.</image:caption
