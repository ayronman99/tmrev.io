        >"Bujang Telajak" tells the story of three best friends, played by
        Saiful, Nabil dan Johan, who fall in love with the same girl, named
        Puteri (Fazura) and end up competing with each other. The three of them
        are actually professional magicians, who met Puteri while filming for a
        commercial. The three friends decide to follow Puteri to learn more
        about her, only to discover that she is also a kindergarten teacher and
        part-time model. In order to get closer to Puteri, Saiful turns to her
        blind father, Haji Hashim (Mustapha Kamal) hoping to hear her secrets
        from him. To his surprise, Saiful is told by Hashim that Puteri longs to
        marry with someone who is handicapped, as she believes that it is the
        only way that she will obtain true love like her mother. And so begins
        the disguise of the three friends as disabled individuals in order to
        win Puteri's heart, including sabotaging each other. Who will triumph in
        this comedic love story?</image:caption
