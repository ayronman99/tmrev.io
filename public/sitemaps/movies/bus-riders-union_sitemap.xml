        >A 1998 editorial in Time magazine made the claim that the city of Los
        Angeles "might just have the most inept public-transport system on the
        planet earth. . . . The neglected bus system, which still handles 91% of
        all transit riders,is now roughly as efficient as travel by burro."
        Academy Awardâ€“winning cinematographer and director Haskell Wexler
        (Medium Cool, Latino) has now fashioned a new documentary tracing three
        years in the life of a group of bus-rider activists passionately engaged
        in the struggle to bring affordable, safe, and adequate mass transit
        back to their city. What might at first sound like a well-intentioned
        but rather parochial subject for a film has resulted in a truly
        inspiring lesson in how working-class, predominantly minority citizens
        forge an effective social movement and how, like Rosa Parks and the
        Montgomery, Alabama, bus boycotters of the 1950s, a group of committed
        individuals can successfully challenge the powers that seek to control
        their lives.</image:caption
