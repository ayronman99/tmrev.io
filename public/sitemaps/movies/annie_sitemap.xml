        >Annie is a young, happy foster kid who's also tough enough to make her
        way on the streets of New York in 2014. Originally left by her parents
        as a baby with the promise that they'd be back for her someday, it's
        been a hard knock life ever since with her mean foster mom Miss
        Hannigan. But everything's about to change when the hard-nosed tycoon
        and New York mayoral candidate Will Stacks—advised by his brilliant VP
        and his shrewd and scheming campaign advisor—makes a thinly-veiled
        campaign move and takes her in. Stacks believes he's her guardian angel,
        but Annie's self-assured nature and bright, sun-will-come-out-tomorrow
        outlook on life just might mean it's the other way
        around.</image:caption
