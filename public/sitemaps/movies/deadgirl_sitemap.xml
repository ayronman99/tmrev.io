        >When high school misfits Rickie and JT decide to ditch school and find
        themselves lost in the crumbling facility of a nearby abandoned
        hospital, they come face-to-face with a gruesome discovery: a body of a
        woman stripped naked, chained to a table and covered in plastic and soon
        realize she is anything but dead. Quickly the boys find themselves
        embarking on a twisted yet poignant journey testing the limits of their
        friendship, and forces both to decide just how far they're willing to
        stretch their understanding of right and wrong.</image:caption
