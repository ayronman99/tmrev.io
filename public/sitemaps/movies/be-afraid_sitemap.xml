        >Not long after John Chambers and his family arrive at their new home in
        a small country town of Pennsylvania, John begins to experience sleep
        paralysis. Lying there paralyzed, trapped within his own nightmare,
        other-worldly beings visit John. They are entities which exist in the
        darkest shadows of the night and can only be seen out of the corner of
        one's eye. These encounters begin to haunt John, transforming to
        complete terror as he discovers the entities' sole purpose... the
        abduction of his seven year old son. In the end, John will uncover the
        town's horrific secret, a portal on his land, and make one last attempt
        to save his son before the shadow people permanently take him away to
        their world.</image:caption
