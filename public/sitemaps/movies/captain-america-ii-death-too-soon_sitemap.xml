        >A government agent is looking for a missing scientist, believing that a
        revolutionary leader known as Miguel has him, and that he is using him
        to get his formula for something that can accelerate the aging process.
        He sends Steve Rogers aka Captain America to find him and rescue the
        scientist, his only lead is a chemical that the scientist needs for his
        formula. As he gets closer to the truth Miguel threatens to spray the
        chemical on a major city unless his demands are met. But the President
        does not negotiate with terrorists, can Captain America save the
        day!?</image:caption
