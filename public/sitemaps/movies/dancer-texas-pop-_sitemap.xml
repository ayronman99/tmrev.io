        >Four guys, best friends, have grown up together in DANCER, TEXAS POP.
        81, a tiny town in West Texas. Years ago, they made a solemn vow to
        leave town together as soon as they graduate. Now, it's that weekend and
        the time has come to "put up or shut up." The clock is ticking and as
        all 81 people in the town watch, comment, offer advice and place bets,
        these four very different boys with unique backgrounds struggle with the
        biggest decision of their lives... whether to stay or leave
        home.</image:caption
