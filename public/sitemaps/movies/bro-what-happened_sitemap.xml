        >Phil and his misfit friends score big when they are invited to the
        party of the century at Bob's house. Known for throwing the craziest
        drug, sex and booze filled parties, this was sure to be a night to
        remember. The only problem is that they can't remember a thing. When
        Phil wakes up realizing that his girlfriend is only hours from knocking
        on his door, he decides to enlist the help of his friends to try to
        piece together what was obviously a night worth
        remembering.</image:caption
