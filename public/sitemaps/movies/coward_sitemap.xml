        >Coward is a 28 minute film set during World War 1 that brings to light
        some of the brutal treatment soldiers received for suffering what would
        now be known as shell-shock. It follows two cousins, Andrew and James,
        from their home in Northern Ireland who join the British Army to fight
        for their Country and make their families proud. Through their eyes we
        see the reality of life on the front lines.</image:caption
