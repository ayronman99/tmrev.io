        >Go where no American has ever gone before. CNBC's Carl Quintanilla
        takes viewers behind the scenes of the world's most successful
        restaurant chain. In this original production, travel with CNBC cameras
        across the country -- and journey as far away as China -- for an
        insider's look at: What it takes to run a McDonald's restaurant -- and
        how lucrative it can be. How chefs in the McDonald's top-secret test
        kitchen are working to develop the next big menu items. Why the
        drive-thru lanes at McDonald's restaurants in China have caused
        unexpected problems. Get a look at how McDonald's is defending itself
        against critics who complain that its food is contributing to an
        epidemic of obesity in America. And peek behind McDonald's curtain to
        see for yourself how a quick-service hamburger stand grew into one of
        the most famous brands on the planet, serving 52 million people around
        the world each day. It's McDonald's ... Super-Sized.</image:caption
