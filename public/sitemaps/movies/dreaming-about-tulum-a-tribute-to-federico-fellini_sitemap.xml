        >A story about the meeting between surrealist film director Federico
        Fellini and writer Carlos Castaneda, an anthropologist and apprentice
        shaman. Fellini goes looking for magical Mexico together with Castaneda.
        The journey confronts him with himself and he is pursued by voices,
        strange occurrences, meetings and reunions that defy the passage through
        space time; inexplicable coincidences that fascinate, irritate and
        intrigue him. Crossing Mexico from north to south shows the many facets
        of the country, the varied landscapes and realities of the territory. He
        and his travel companions are at the same time witnesses, victims and
        protagonists of a surreal adventure that takes them from Tijuana to
        Tulum.</image:caption
