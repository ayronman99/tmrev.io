        >In bustling era of 19th-century Louisiana, sugar is as valuable as
        gold, and pirates like Lili Scarlet (Patricia Medina, Mr. Arkadin) will
        do anything to get it. After robbing Jules Tulane’s (John Dehner, The
        Boys from Brazil) estate of his crop, Scarlet takes over Tulane’s land
        debt and forces him to pay or go to prison. In exchange for postponing
        his debt, Scarlet allows Tulane’s son, André (Lex Barker, Robin Hood and
        the Pirates), to work as her servant. When André and Scarlet fall in
        love, it leads to jealous rage from Scarlet’s former paramour, expert
        swordsman Hugo (Warren Stevens, Forbidden Planet) — and when Hugo looks
        to raid the Tulane estate again, it is up to André and Scarlet to take
        him down and save the estate.</image:caption
