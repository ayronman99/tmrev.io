        >Brussels, La Monnaie Opera House. Three people near the end of their
        lives meet with choreographers, actors and musicians. They take part in
        a unique experience which involves music, dance and silence. Their
        journey becomes a tribute to the fragility of the human condition,
        between reality and representation, tragedy of the body and freedom of
        the spirit. Together they question their own relationship with
        death.</image:caption
