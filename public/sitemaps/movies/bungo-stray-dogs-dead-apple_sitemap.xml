        >A large scale catastrophe is occurring across the planet. Ability users
        are discovered after the appearance of a mysterious fog, apparently
        having committed suicide, so the Armed Detective Agency sets out to
        investigate these mysterious deaths. The case seems to involve an
        unknown ability user referred to as "Collector," a man who could be the
        mastermind behind the incident. Trust and courage are put to the test in
        order to save the city of Yokohama and ability users across the world
        from the grip of Collector where the Armed Detective Agency forms an
        unlikely partnership with the dangerous Port Mafia.</image:caption
