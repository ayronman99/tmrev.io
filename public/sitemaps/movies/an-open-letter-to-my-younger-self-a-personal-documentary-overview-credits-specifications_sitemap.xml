        >This is a personal documentary that confronts my racism, especially as
        a white cisgender male. It’s approximately 16 minutes long. This video
        follows and explains my racist behaviors as a teenager and young adult
        and my transition into having anti-racist values. It explores the
        location in which I was raised, and how my relationship with Traverse
        City, Michigan played a role in developing my racist behaviors. This is
        not meant to be an excuse for my racism, nor a justification of it, but
        rather it’s an exploration of the journey it took for me to let go of
        old behaviors and embrace new values. The video is woven together
        through an open letter to my younger self, and supplemented by videos
        and stills that reflect how my relationship with the environments I’m in
        and have been in, have influenced me.</image:caption
