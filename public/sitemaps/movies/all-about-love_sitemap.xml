        >After being separated for years, former lovers Macy and Anita are
        reunited at a pregnancy seminar. After sharing the accidental
        circumstances that led to their respective pregnancies, the two fall
        back in love. However, to add to the trouble caused by the fathers of
        their babies, Anita also finds herself the victim of gender
        discrimination at work due to her pregnancy. Will Macy and Anita make it
        through the obstacles in the way of their reunion, and what roles will
        the two to-be-fathers end up playing in the women's
        lives?</image:caption
