        >After years of meticulous planning, a terrorist operation is reaching
        its final stages. The authorities have received no intelligence; they
        are in a race against time but don't yet know it. As the operation
        unfolds, we see the working lives of men and women directly affected by
        terrorism. Among them: a firemen worried about the increasingly
        dangerous conditions he and his men are expected to work under; the head
        of the anti-terrorist branch whose responsibility it is to protect
        London and a female Muslim detective brought into Scotland Yard to
        investigate another suspected terrorist cell. But it is too late to stop
        the attack.</image:caption
