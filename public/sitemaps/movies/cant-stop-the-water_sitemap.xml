        >For 170 years, a Native American community has occupied Isle de Jean
        Charles, a tiny island deep in the bayous of Louisiana. They have
        fished, hunted, and lived off the land. Now the land that has sustained
        them for generations is vanishing before their eyes. Coastal erosion,
        sea level rise, and increasing storms are overwhelming the island. Over
        the last fifty years, Isle de Jean Charles has been gradually shrinking,
        and it is now almost gone. For these Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw Indians,
        their land is more than simply a place to live. It is the epicenter of
        their people and traditions. They now must prepare to say goodbye to the
        place, where, for eight generations, their ancestors cultivated a unique
        part of Louisiana culture.</image:caption
