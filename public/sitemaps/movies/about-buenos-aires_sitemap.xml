        >Eleven young film-makers got together to collaborate in this atypical
        project. Atypical not only because of its technical specs, but because
        of its narrative structure. There are several scenes with only the city
        in common, and more as a conceptual presence at that than as a precise
        geography. None of those scenes contains a single "story": Each one of
        them is part of a larger situation that we cannot see, as though the
        beginning and end of each "story" had to be filled in by the
        audience.</image:caption
