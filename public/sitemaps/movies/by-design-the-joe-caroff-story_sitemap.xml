        >He may not be household name, but Joe Caroff is one the most
        influential graphic designers of the 20th century. His work is a history
        of the pop culture of our time: from iconic corporate logos (like ABC
        News and ORION Pictures) and book jackets (Norman Mailer’s The Naked and
        the Dead) to some of the most instantly recognizable “title treatments”
        for such classics as WEST SIDE STORY, A HARD DAY'S NIGHT, CABARET, LAST
        TANGO IN PARIS, MANHATTAN, and the James Bond gun logo. Caroff’s story
        is told by the centenarian himself, with reminiscences of growing up
        during the Depression and service in WWII, along with interviews with
        Phyliss Caroff, his wife of over 70 years, producer Mike Medavoy, and
        others.</image:caption
