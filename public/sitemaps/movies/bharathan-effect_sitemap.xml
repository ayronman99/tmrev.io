        >One among the few sci-fi movies in Malayalam, 'Bharathan Effect' tells
        the story of Bharathan (Biju Menon) who is a genius inventor struggling
        to make ends meet. His efforts are under appreciated by his wife Geetha
        (Geethu Mohandas) and causes constant conflict between them. After
        apparently seeing an object float in air defying gravity; Bharathan gets
        obsessed by the whole idea. He tries to research the topic with the
        financial assistance of his landlord (Jagathy Sreekumar) despite the
        entire community branding him as a lunatic. The rest of the film deals
        with his quest to find the truth behind the strange phenomenon of
        anti-gravity that he witnesses.</image:caption
