        >It has been said that 10,000 years from now only one name will still be
        remembered, that of Neil Armstrong. But in the four decades since he
        first set foot on the moon, Armstrong has become increasingly reclusive.
        Andrew Smith, author of the best-selling book Moondust, journeys across
        America to try and discover the real Neil Armstrong. He tracks down the
        people who knew Armstrong, from his closest childhood friend to fellow
        astronauts and Houston technicians, and even the barber who sold his
        hair, in a wry and sideways look at the reluctant hero of the greatest
        event of the 20th century.</image:caption
