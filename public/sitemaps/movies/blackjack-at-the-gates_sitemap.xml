        >Ten years ago, a baby was killed in a house arson fire after a violent
        home invasion. The parents used the tragedy as a motivation to help
        build an evangelical community church but now the mother has comes to
        Jack for help. Jack agrees to look into the still unsolved crime but in
        looking for the truth Jack will have to fight the system and his own
        conscience to uncover a tangled web of lies and deception. In the end,
        Jack must decide if the truth should prevail over the interests of the
        innocent.</image:caption
