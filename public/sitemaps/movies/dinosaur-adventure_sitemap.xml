        Finally the eggshells crackled. "It is a boy", the dinosaur father
        shouted luckily. And in a little while, the small Dino played with the

        earth began to tremble. And shortly after, the volcano erupted. The
        small Dino had to wait until the volcano had eased, before he could run
        home. But when he arrived he was very frightened. Everything was
        destroyed. No trace of his family! "I must find them", he sobbed. And he
        started a long and adventurous search.</image:caption
