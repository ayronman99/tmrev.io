        Once removed their image of poor refugees on the roads, the Kosovars
        have strangely disappeared from the media world and Kosovo is again an
        abstraction. Bajram Rexhepi is entirely concrete. Surgeon by profession,
        he's a surgeon that fought the war in the ranks of the KLA, the Kosovo
        Liberation Army. With the upcoming of peace, his unquestioned authority
        made him the elected mayor of Mitrovica. The use made of this authority
        may undermine some misconceptions.</image:caption
