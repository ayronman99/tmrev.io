        >Abu Raed is an old airport janitor who has always yearned to travel the
        world but has never been able to afford it. One day, he finds an old
        discarded pilot's hat, and discovers a calling: a group of children in
        his poor neighborhood assume he's an airline captain and beg him to
        share stories of the world outside of Amman, Jordan. Through imaginary
        tales, a friendship forms, and Abu Raed is soon faced with the grim
        realities of the children's home life. Thus he takes it upon himself to
        make a difference in their lives.</image:caption
