        >In 1919 an art school opened in Germany that would change the world
        forever. It was called the Bauhaus. A century later, its radical
        thinking still shapes our lives today. Bauhaus 100 is the story of
        Walter Gropius, architect and founder of the Bauhaus, and the teachers
        and students he gathered to form this influential school. Traumatised by
        his experiences during the Great War, and determined that technology
        should never again be used for destruction, Gropius decided to reinvent
        the way art and design were taught. At the Bauhaus, all the disciplines
        would come together to create the buildings of the future, and define a
        new way of living in the modern world.</image:caption
