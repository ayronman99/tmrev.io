        >Enrico Russo rapes and slaughters children. A magistrate, a policeman
        and a psychiatrist try to arrest him, but it’s too difficult to identify
        a cancer that hides itself behind a normal life. Then, one day, Enrico
        meets Andrea, a 7 year old child, and falls in love with him. He wants
        to be Andrea’s good father, the good father he himself never had. But
        his emotional delirium isn’t able to hold back his animal instinct. By
        pure ‘chance’, the detectives find the monster in the act of his last
        execution. On time?</image:caption
