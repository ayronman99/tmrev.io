        >Laarni is a journalist who has been assigned to write a news report
        about a ghost called Estrela from a village named Cavite. Estrela is
        believed to be the spirit of a young teenage girl who was brutally
        abused. Through her research, the reporter learns that before Estrela
        died by her own father's hands, she witnessed him murder her own mother.
        It now seems that the story of the ghost of Estrela is more than a myth.
        Her spirit has returned to seek it's revenge. Can Laarni discover the
        secret that fuels Estrellas rage before more lives are
        lost?</image:caption
