        >In Turkey, once every year, about 1.5 million young people take the
        infamous Student Selection Exam hoping to have the right to a university
        education. “3 HOURS” focuses on the personal dimension of this
        “life-and-death matter” by following the lives of 6 high school seniors
        for a year, observing and witnessing their experiences before, during
        and after this exam. The thoughts, emotions and experiences of the
        candidates and those around them are not sifted through any kind of
        scientific procedure and are represented as directly as possible, as the
        filmmakers are the observers,ing witnesses, guestsintruders, and guests
        inof the lives of these young women and men.</image:caption
