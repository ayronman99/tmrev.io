        >Filmed over the course of four years, Grabsky and his Seventh Art team
        followed leading concert pianist Leif Ove Andsnes's attempt to
        understand and interpret one of the greatest sets of works for piano
        ever written: Beethoven's five piano concertos.The end result is a
        beautifully-crafted film with lavish cinematography, a signature of
        Grabsky and Seventh Art's style. Considered one of the top pianists of
        the age, Leif Ove Andsnes offers rare insights into the mind of a
        world-class pianist and access to his personal and professional life.
        Against the wonderful background of Leif Ove Andsnes playing these five
        pieces, we also peel back the many myths of Beethoven's life. Perhaps
        above all it is the fresh new biography of Beethoven that is most
        revealing.</image:caption
