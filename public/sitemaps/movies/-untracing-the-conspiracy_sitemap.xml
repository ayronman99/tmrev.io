        >In 1987, the Singapore government, using the Internal Security Act,
        arrested 22 people in what was called "Operation Spectrum". These people
        were held indefinitely without trial, physically and mentally tortured,
        and coerced into admitting that they were guilty of a "Marxist
        conspiracy" on public television. In this film, ex-detainees share what
        they experienced during that time.</image:caption
