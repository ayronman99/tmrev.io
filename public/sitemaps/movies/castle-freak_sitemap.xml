        >After she’s permanently blinded in a tragic car accident, Rebecca
        receives some bizarre news: her long-lost mother has recently passed
        away, leaving her their family’s ancestral castle in rural Albania.
        Traveling to the estate with a group of friends, Rebecca hopes it will
        be an opportunity for her to reconnect with a past she never knew and a
        mother who seemingly left her behind. When mysterious events begin to
        occur and her friends begin to die, Rebecca must unravel the secrets of
        her family’s history before she too falls prey to the Castle
        Freak.</image:caption
