        >Government official Ling Choi Sin journeys to the parched Black
        Mountain Village, to help its inhabitants find water. As he leads a
        group of volunteers up the haunted mountain, he encounters a bevy of
        sexy demons as well as a lovely girl named Siu Sin. After wooing her
        with some candy, he falls for her... and then realises that he is caught
        in a deadly triangle; another guy, a demon-hunter named Yan Chek Ha is
        also in love with Siu Sin. However, before the two men can settle their
        differences, they have to contend with the evil Tree Demon as well as a
        one-armed demon hunter who is determined to kill all the supernatural
        beings.</image:caption
