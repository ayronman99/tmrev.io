        >Rita, a witty 26-year-old hairdresser, wants to 'discover' herself, so
        she joins the Open University where she meets the disillusioned
        professor of literature, Dr. Frank Bryant. His marriage has failed, his
        new girlfriend is having an affair with his best friend and he can't get

        needs is a challenge... and along comes Rita.</image:caption
