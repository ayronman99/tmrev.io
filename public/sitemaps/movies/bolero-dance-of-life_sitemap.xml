        >The film follows four families, with different nationalities (French,
        German, Russian and American) but with the same passion for music, from
        the 1930s to the 1960s. The various story lines cross each other time
        and again in different places and times, with their own theme scores
        that evolve as time passes. The main event in the film is the Second
        World War, which throws the stories of the four musical families
        together and mixes their fates. Although all characters are fictional,
        many of them are loosely based on historical musical icons (Édith Piaf,
        Josephine Baker, Herbert von Karajan, Glenn Miller, Rudolf Nureyev,
        etc.) The Boléro dance sequence at the end brings all the threads
        together.</image:caption
