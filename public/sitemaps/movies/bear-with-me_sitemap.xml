        >An orphaned bear cub is adopted by little Emily and her family. They
        name the cub Masha, raise her and release her back into the wild. Three
        years go by, and Emily is lost deep in the forest. Cold, frightened and
        alone in the darkness, she falls and is knocked unconscious. When she
        awakens, Emily is amazed to see that a brown bear has kept her warm and
        dry all night by cuddling her. It's Masha â€“ and Emily is overjoyed to be
        reunited with the bear just when she needs a friend most. Together the
        two bravely set off on an adventure to find their way home. Bear With Me
        is a tale the whole family will find as exciting as it is heart-warming
        . . . and the magnificent forests of the Pacific Northwest lend this
        story of loyalty, friendship and adventure a magic all its
        own.</image:caption
