        >When the charred remains of woman are found, Säpo, the Swedish Security
        Services, suspect Gunvald Larsson of being mixed up in her murder. The
        dead woman was wanted internationally and a member of a group of
        militant eco-activists carrying out attacks around the world. Gunvald
        sets out on his own to find the woman's murderer, with Säpo on his
        heels. Martin Beck is ordered to arrest Gunvald and his loyalty to his
        colleague is now put to the test.</image:caption
