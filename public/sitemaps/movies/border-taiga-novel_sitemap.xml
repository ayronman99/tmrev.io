        as everywhere, there are men and women. Everyone has his own story, his
        own destiny, his own love. The common thing is that they all came here
        once on duty and stayed for a long time. Marina Goloshchekina is nice,
        kind, right. Galya The tourniquet is intelligent, passionate,
        determined. Albina Raven - extravagant, unpredictable, thin. Three
        friends, three sisters in happiness and misfortune, officers' wives.
        They help each other stand in this completely feminine world, where
        every man has a gun! And this means that love and danger go hand in
        hand. Marina quite unexpectedly meets her true love of the young officer
        Ivan Stolbov. Learn about this new secret love girlfriend. On the one
        hand, you can rejoice over Marina. But how can she rejoice herself, if
        behind five years of marriage with a strong, strong-willed and very
        unpredictable Nikita Goloshchekin?</image:caption
