        >Death of Game is the remake of a scene from Bruce Lee's film, Game of
        Death. The mid seventies was a period of growing visibility of actors of
        color in Blaxploitation and Asian action films. These genres both gave
        mainstream exposure to but also paradoxically reinforced the stereotypes
        of Blacks and Asians. The moment of the meeting and subsequent fight
        between Bruce Lee and Kareem Abdul Jabar represents a point of contact
        defiantly outside of a dominant, white culture.</image:caption
