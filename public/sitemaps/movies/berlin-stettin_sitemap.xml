        >In his film "Berlin-Stettin", well-known documentary film director
        Volker Koepp embarks on a journey to the places of his own past: Born in
        1944 in Stettin (now the Polish city of Szczecin) and grown up in
        Berlin-Karlshorst, Koepp has again and again met people and found places
        located between the two cities that he turned into the protagonists of
        his films – in Brandenburg, in Mecklenburg, and in Pomerania. Now, he
        once again returns to these places and finds out that his own biography
        overlaps with the biographies of his found again protagonists as well as
        with the history of this region. During his search for traces, Koepp at
        the same time finds new people, new regions, and new themes that are
        also worth becoming a part of Koepp′s narration.</image:caption
