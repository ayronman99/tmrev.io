        >Sandra (Sandra Ng) is in for a serious dose of culture shock when she
        returns from her studies abroad to her home in Macau, where her father
        is the head of a major network of underground gambling, prostitution,
        and other assorted super-vices. Sandra's father is putting on the
        pressure for her to inherit his morally-corrupt throne, but her morals
        dictate that she have nothing to do with it. However, Sandra's childhood
        friend Josie (Josie Ho) has gotten herself into serious debt and
        desperately needs any help Sandra can offer. Will Sandra help her friend
        at the cost of her own morals? It's now up to her to decide between
        upholding her own beliefs and making serious ethical sacrifices for the
        sake of her friend.</image:caption
