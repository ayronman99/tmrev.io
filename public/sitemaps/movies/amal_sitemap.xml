        >Amal is 14 years old when she ends up on Tahrir Square during the
        Egyptian revolution, after the death of her boyfriend in the Port Said
        Stadium riot. During the protests, she is beaten by police and dragged
        across the square by her hair. This coming-of-age film follows her over
        the years after the revolution. As the film cuts between the unfolding
        current events and Amal’s rapidly changing life and appearance, we see
        her searching for her own identity in a country in transition. Amal is
        fiery and fearless, sinking her teeth into the protests and constantly
        lecturing her mother, who works as a judge. A girl among men, she also
        has to fight for respect and the right to take part, both in the street
        and in the rest of her life. In Egypt, even for a young woman like
        Amal—her name means "hope"—the choices open to her for her future are
        limited.</image:caption
