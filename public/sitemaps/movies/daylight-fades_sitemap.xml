        >Elizabeth and Johnny, each of whose pasts have been sorrowful, find
        salvation in each the other. Theirs is a romance that knows no bounds
        until an accident leaves one in a coma and their burgeoning love ripped
        apart. Enter the guarded Seth who has been keeping a watch over the
        shattered Elizabeth. He resolves to do what it takes to save Johnny even
        if that means the only way to prolong his life, which hangs in the
        balance, is by turning him into a vampire. Shot in Memphis Tennessee
        from a reinvigorating fresh perspective, Daylight Fades conjures a
        heartbreaking experience of love found and lost and reborn, the depths
        of despair and the profound connections we break in the mending of our
        hearts.</image:caption
