        >Kate Bowman (Jocelin Donahue) is an average social worker who, after
        the sudden death of her twin sister, is investigating the mysterious
        deaths of other people who died in their sleep. Shortly before their
        deaths, the victims all reported a supernatural force that appeared to
        them while they were suffering from sleep paralysis. When Kate
        investigates further into the case, she opens herself up to the
        creature's wrath and soon finds herself and her family suffering from an
        ancient evil.</image:caption
