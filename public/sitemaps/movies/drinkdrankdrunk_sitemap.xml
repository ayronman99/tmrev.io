        >A romantic comedy, the film is about Siu Min, a Budweiser girl who
        takes pity on Michael (Daniel), an ethnic Chinese restaurateur from
        France drinking away his misfortune because his food is too
        sophisticated for (and thus unpopular with) the working class
        neighborhood in which both work. Unsatisfied with spending her days as a
        beer girl, the ambitious Siu Min becomes Michael's partner in the
        restaurant business, and eventually falls in love with him. Michael,
        however, must reconcile his dream of traveling the world with his other
        dream of running a successful restaurant.</image:caption
