        >The movie opens as the two protagonists, Rodrigo and Rocco join their
        families to hold a birthday party for their grandfather, Rodrigo
        Carnicero, which through most part of the movie is only referred to as
        "El abuelo" (Spanish for Grandpa). Rodrigo is a regular middle-class
        teenager, while Rocco (who, in fact, is also named Rodrigo but shortens
        his name to Rocco) is rather more unconventional, a marijuana user and
        indie magazine writer, and has deep conflicts with his father
        Luis.</image:caption
