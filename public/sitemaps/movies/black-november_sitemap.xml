        >A volatile, oil-rich Nigerian community wages war against their corrupt
        government and a multi-national oil corporation to protect their land
        from being destroyed by excessive drilling and spills. To seek justice,
        a rebel organization kidnaps an American oil executive and demands that
        his corporation end the destruction and pollution. Inspired by true
        events, Black November is the gripping story of how a community rises up
        and takes drastic measures to make sure their voices are
        heard.</image:caption
