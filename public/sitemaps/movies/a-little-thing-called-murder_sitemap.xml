        >Fast forgery without mistakes. Shoplifting under pressure. Effective
        body disposal. The ability to multitask various felonies. These are just
        a few of the "talents" that mother-and-son grifters Sante and Kenny
        Kimes possess. Based on shocking true events, this flick takes you into
        the dark, sordid world of this deadly duo, from their bizarre
        relationship to their heinous crimes. It's no surprise that two-time
        Emmy winner Judy Davis earned a nomination for this
        performance.</image:caption
