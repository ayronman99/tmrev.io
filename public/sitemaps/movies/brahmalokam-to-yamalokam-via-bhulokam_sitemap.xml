        >In Brahmalokam, Brahma (Rajendra Prasad) has a small tiff with
        Saraswathi Devi (Kalyani) and he decrees that marriage has to be
        followed by death. In Bhulokam, Sreenu (Sivaji) a happy go lucky
        struggling to pass his degree chances upon Swetha (Sonia) and it is love
        at first sight. Meanwhile, Sreenus friend Sobhan Babu (Venu Madhav) does
        a penance to Brahma and wins his heart. Brahma gives a pot to Sobhan
        Babu and tells him to drink it, that will give the power to read anyones
        fate. However, a situation happens and Sreenu ends up drinking it. In no
        time, his life falls in place, he wins the heart of Swetha. However,
        Brahma realizes that this boon is causing trouble to the law of nature.
        He along with Yama (Jayaprakash Reddy) and Chitragupta (AVS) come to
        Bhulokam to retake the powers. Whether they are successful or not forms
        the rest of the story.</image:caption
