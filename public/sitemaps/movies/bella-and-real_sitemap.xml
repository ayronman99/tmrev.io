        >Real, an immigrant soccer team in chaos recruits Olle, a Swedish coach,
        to create order. All of the players want to play center. Olle's right
        hand man is Sammi, father of a Kurd family with a son on the team. His
        daughter Bella has the impossible dream of becoming the goaltender. All
        of the men in Real are opposed to women on the soccer field. The Kurd
        culture demands that the patriarch of the family keeps the female in
        order or he loses face. At Olle's first match with Real the goalie
        leaves for a date. Olle has no one but Bella to put in the
        goal.</image:caption
