        >The countryside of Rio Grande do Sul, and high-school student, Daniel,
        spends a normal adolescence life with his family, studying, riding his
        bicycle, playing games on the Internet and expecting one day to move to
        the big city of Porto Alegre. Daniel has a crush on his girlfriend Mim,
        who has just broken up with him but is still his friend, and his best
        friend, Lucas, is one of the best students in São Lucas High-School.
        Daniel is the son of Elaine and the photographer Daniel, who left Elaine
        when she was pregnant and moved alone to Thailand. Daniel is raised by
        Elaine and his stepfather Antônio, and shares a house with his
        half-sister, Maria Clara. One day, Daniel receives a letter from his
        biological father, who has malaria, and he is reluctant to open the
        envelope.</image:caption
