        >For some, the lives we have are not always the lives we wanted. For
        Joe, a small time guy from the small time town of Sandwich, Illinois,
        his has not even come close - until now. Faced with death and having
        recently met the girl of his dreams, Claire, Joe has to find a way to
        live the life of passion he'd always wanted, and he has to do it fast.
        Journey with Joe towards the great beyond, not half as imaginative as
        the path he's finally forged here on Earth. Ride with him as he's forced
        to figure out the meaning of life that he won't have time to live. With
        the help of his best friend, Frank, and his brilliant, if not terrified
        mother, Sarah, Joe will finally learn to live, love, and explore beyond
        his wildest dreams. And we'll get to watch one man's journey unfold,
        from the first day of the rest of his life on.</image:caption
