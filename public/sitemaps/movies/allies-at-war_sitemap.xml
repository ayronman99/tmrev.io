        >The leadership and military expertise of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Winston
        Churchill, and Charles De Gaulle proved invaluable to the Allied cause
        during World War II, but while these three men were fighting for the
        same side, the relationship between them was not always cheery. De
        Gaulle admired Churchill, but didn't get along with him especially well,
        while both Churchill and Roosevelt had a passionate dislike of De
        Gaulle. Allies at War is a documentary which examines the often strained
        relationships between these three men, and how they were able to set
        aside their differences for the good of humanity. Allies at War is
        narrated by Brian Dennehy.</image:caption
