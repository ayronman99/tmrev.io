        >Leaving her seemingly glamorous Hollywood life on hold, Evie Lee is
        forced to return to her small hometown of Balsam Falls, Tennessee and
        her family's once-thriving Christmas tree farm to attend her fatherâ€™s
        unexpected funeral. As the eldest sibling, she finds herself executor of
        an estate that owes a massive inheritance tax, much to her younger
        brother's dismay. Torn between pursuing her music career and saving her
        family's legacy, she must decide what it really means to find her place
        in the world. Charleene Closshey stars amidst a colorful cast including
        Robert Loggia, Tyler Ritter, Booboo Stewart and Naomi Judd in this
        heart-warming musical holiday tale about facing your past, rediscovering
        your voice, and fulfilling your dreams.</image:caption
