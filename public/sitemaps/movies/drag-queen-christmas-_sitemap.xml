        >Deck the halls with boughs of hennys: Your favorite drag stars from
        RuPaul's Drag Race and The Boulet Brothers' Dragula are coming together
        for a jolly holiday special. "Unfortunately, COVID has sidelined our
        tour this year," producer Murray Hodgson said in a press statement.
        "This would have been our fifth season on tour and there was no way we
        were going to let down the fans this year, so weâ€™re making it available
        "on demand" for fans all around the world. Fans can watch the show with
        family and friends as many times as they want throughout the entire
        holiday season."</image:caption
