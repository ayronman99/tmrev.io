        >A vision of an unconventional family together with their conflicts and
        rivalry, a vision full of ironic sense of humour but also emotional
        moments and true closeness. When the elder brother, Andrzej, suddenly
        falls ill, despite their differences and a wall of misunderstandings
        that has grown between them, his younger brother is taking it upon
        himself to care for his brother in need.</image:caption
