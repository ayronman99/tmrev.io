        >The story of William da Silva Lima, the last survivor of the group that
        founded the Comando Vermelho at the end of the 1970s. It shows him
        living together with the political prisoners incurred under the same
        National Security Law and his leadership in the Ilha Grande Prison
        creating a type of unheard of conduct and solidarity in the Brazilian
        prisons. The film goes on to tell of the group's actions on the streets
        of Rio de Janeiro during the beginning of the 80s when they irritated
        the police with their daring robberies, as well as portraying the
        surprising love story between William and Tereza. The narrative weaves
        its way between the intimate conflict and the spectacular assaults and
        escapes.</image:caption
