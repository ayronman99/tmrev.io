        >Benoit Pilon introduces us to those who live in the vast region more
        than a thousand kilometers northwest of Montreal, where, in the early
        1970s, the massive James Bay project forever changed the landscape and
        people's lives. To carry out this mega-project, one village was created
        (Radisson) and another moved (Fort George, now known as Chisasibi).
        Though most of the workers have since gone home, some chose to stay.
        Radisson's inhabitants are still often tempted to move back down South,
        but many have developed imaginative ways of putting down roots. And
        while the Crees of Chisasibi look to the future, they also want to
        maintain their traditions, especially for the younger generation who are
        so attracted to the ease of modern life. But what with the hunting
        trips, going-away parties and still-vibrant customs, the residents of
        these two communities simply enjoy the Northern way of
        life.</image:caption
