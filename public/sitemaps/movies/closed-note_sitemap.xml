        >Kae Horii moves into her new flat in an undisclosed area of Kyoto.
        While unpacking her belongings, she discovers a hidden compartment
        behind a inconspicuous mirror. In that compartment, Kae finds a
        notebook, that turns out to be a diary belonging to the previous tenant.
        Later that evening Kae starts to read the diary. The writer of the diary
        is Ibuki Mano, a young lady about to embark on her first year as an
        elementary school teacher. Ibuki is also in love with a man named
        Takashi, who may or may not hold similar feelings for Ibuki. The diary
        immediately resonates with Kae, as she plans to become an elementary
        school teacher herself. Ibuki’s experiences also works as an
        inspirational instructional guide for Kae’s own personal life. Kae is
        also in love with an aloof illustrator/artist, who may or may not hold
        similar feelings for Kae.</image:caption
