        >Filmmaker Julia Pimsleur used to make up elaborate lies about her
        brother Marc, rather than explain that he had dropped out of college,
        turned his back on his Jewish heritage and moved to a Christian commune
        in Alaska. She and her mother initially feared that Marc had joined a
        cult. This documentary traces Julia's efforts to understand his
        conversion and to revive their relationship, despite her fundamentalist
        brother's disapproval of her bisexuality. Julia travels from New York
        City to her brother's religious community, where she and Marc search for
        common ground and discover the meaning of family.</image:caption
