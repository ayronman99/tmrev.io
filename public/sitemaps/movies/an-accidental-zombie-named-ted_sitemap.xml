        >Ted is not a zombie. Just ask him. Sure, he picked up a "skin thing" on
        his vacay in The Caribbean, and he's hungering for brains, but who
        isn't? Anyway, things are bound to get better when Ted inherits his
        grandpa's fortune; all he's gotta do is wait for the old man to die. In
        the meantime, in case things weren't strange enough, Ted follows a hot
        vampire into group therapy where the patients all suffer disorders of
        the paranormal. Yep. Things just went from weird to
        wacky.</image:caption
