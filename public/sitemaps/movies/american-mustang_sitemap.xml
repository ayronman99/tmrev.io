        >Fueled by stunning footage, this stirring documentary considers wild
        horses' role in the American psyche and their dwindling numbers in
        today's West. In an artful blend of exquisite nature documentary and
        character-driven narrative, the majestic wild horses of the American
        West are revealed in stereoscopic 3D as never before. The wonder in a
        girlâ€™s eye pulls us into the drama that unfolds on hundreds of millions
        of acres of public land. The battle lines have long been carved into the
        landscape, and the players are deeply entrenched. Yet as the subtle
        choreography that has evolved over thousands of years begins, we are
        captivated. The intricate dance between a man and a wild horse presents
        lessons for us all, even the battle-hardened special interest groups
        fighting for the place of the AMERICAN MUSTANG.</image:caption
