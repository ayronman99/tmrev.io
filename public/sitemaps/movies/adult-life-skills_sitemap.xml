        >Anna is stuck: she’s approaching 30 and has just moved back to her
        rural home-town, and into a shed in her mother’s backyard. She spends
        her time working a menial job at a local boating center and hides in the
        depths of her imagination, making movies with her thumbs. Irritated by
        her childish behavior, Anna's mother insists that she move out of her
        shed and on with her life. When a troubled young boy starts hanging
        around, the two form an unlikely bond. Through their strange yet
        mutually beneficial friendship, Anna slowly begins to confront her
        perpetual state of arrested development.</image:caption
