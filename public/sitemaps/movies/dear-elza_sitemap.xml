        >End of 1942, Ukraine, eastern front. The Private Lombos (Gábor Makray),
        a soldier loyal to his homeland, whose only desire as a freshman is to
        see his young wife again, serves here. However, due to an administrative
        error, he misses the train heading home. He thinks it can’t get any
        worse, but the real hell only begins. Educated young teacher, who speaks
        3 languages, desperately fulfills his duty, takes up arms again, and
        marches on the Eastern Front. He is wounded in an attack and survives
        the night behind enemy lines in a pit. This is when he meets a
        mysterious old man (Tamás Varga), and this meeting changes everything.
        The old man's words shake his unbroken faith in his military family and
        homeland. At dawn, Russian soldiers find them, and Lombos is captured
        and then caught among the “tramplers”. The old man then also appears
        among the enemy's ranks, walks in the shadows, and tries to keep the
        young soldier alive at all costs with his advice.</image:caption
