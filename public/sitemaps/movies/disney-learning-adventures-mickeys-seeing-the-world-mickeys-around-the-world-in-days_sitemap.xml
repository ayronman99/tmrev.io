        >Travel around the world with Mickey for an adventure in language skills
        and early geography. As Mickey and his friends zip around the globe,
        they invite your child to say hello and goodbye in different languages,
        match animals with their environments, and learn about the kinds of
        houses people live in around the world. Developed by Disney and leading
        educators, learning is woven throughout a classic adventure packed with
        storytelling magic that will capture young imaginations. Learning is
        more fun with your favorite Disney characters to share the
        adventure!</image:caption
