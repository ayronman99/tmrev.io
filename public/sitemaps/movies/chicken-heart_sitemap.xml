        >Former boxer Iwano, teamed up with Sada and Maru, who live in the same
        apartment building, makes his daily living as a punching bag for drunken
        businessmen in some corner of the amusement quarters. The three have
        continuously avoided putting themselves in a situation that could tie
        them down, especially Iwano, who is totally clueless about what he wants
        to do with his life. One day, they receive notice that their apartment
        building will be torn down. As a compensation for the eviction, their
        remaining rent is considered as settled. Having lost their place to
        live, the three each try to find their way.</image:caption
