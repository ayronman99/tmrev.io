        >Features performances of Doc Watson ranging from his 1950s musical
        partner, pianist Jack Williams, to his son Merle (seen playing exquisite
        slide guitar)... Also with Ricky Skaggs (singing and playing mandolin in
        a Monroe Brothers style set), and a stellar string and featuring Mark
        O'Connor, Tony Rice, Bela Fleck, David Grisman and Jerry Douglas. This
        collection ends with a solo set from Doc which brings his music full
        circle to the straightforward simplicity with which it was first
        presented during the 1960s folk revival.</image:caption
