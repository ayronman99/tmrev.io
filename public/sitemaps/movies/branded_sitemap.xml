        >In this post-apocalyptic-western, Alexander Dante has lived the past 10
        years in exile for the killing of Edwin, his beloved brother. Then one
        day he's astounded to receive a letter, purportedly from Edwin. The
        letter states Edwin now lives in the distant village shown on the
        enclosed map. At first, Alexander dismisses the letter as a hoax but
        there's something about the letter that rings true. He treks through a
        hard and hostile land that at long last opens up into a tranquil
        village. There, he's stunned to confront the impossible: his brother is
        very much alive. Alexander is overjoyed to see his brother but he is
        tormented as he knows he has killed him. Now Alexander must root out the
        truth -- whatever the consequences.</image:caption
