        >Bukak Api was made to heighten HIV/AIDS awareness amongst the
        sex-worker community in Chow Kit, Kuala Lumpur, portraying the
        subculture as honestly as possible. The film was a community effort
        which brought together various agencies, residents, brothel owners,
        sex-workers, film students and production houses in support of the need
        for community-friendly information. It is an example of Pink Triangle
        Malaysia's working approach of community development for HIV/AIDS
        education, support and care. Bukak Api or "to open fire" is street lingo
        among sex-workers to mean "to have sex with a client".</image:caption
