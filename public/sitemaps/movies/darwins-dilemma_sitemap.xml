        >Darwin's Dilemma examines what many consider to be the most powerful
        refutation of Darwinian evolution-the Cambrian fossil record. Charles
        Darwin realized that the fossil evidence did not support his theory of
        gradual, step-by-step evolutionary development. He hoped that future
        generations of scientists would make the discoveries necessary to
        validate his ideas. Today, after more than 150 years of exploration
        fossil evidence of slow, incremental biological change has yet to be
        excavated. Instead, we find a picture of the rapid appearance of fully
        developed, complex organisms during the outset of the Cambrian
        geological era. Organisms that embody almost all of the major animal
        body plans that exist today. This remarkable explosion of life is best
        explained by the existence of a transcendent
        intelligence.</image:caption
