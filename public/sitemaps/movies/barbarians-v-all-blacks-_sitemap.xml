        >The All Blacks went into their final tour match having recorded
        victories over Wales, Scotland and England: the Barbarians, as is their
        tradition, had limited preparation, an uncapped player and an obligation
        to attack. However, the Barbarians' side was comprised of many of the
        truly great players of the era - Duckham, Gibson, JPR Williams, Bennett,
        Edwards, McBride and Carmichael - and together they were to produce a
        truly remarkable team performance, including a try from Gareth Edwards
        in the third minute which has proved, with the passage of time, to have
        been one of the best in the history of the game. Soon, the All Blacks,
        with outstanding players like Going, Batty and Williams, began to match
        their opponents' exhilarating quality. As attack and counter-attack
        brought a fantastic response from the Arms Park, the stage was set for
        the greatest rugby match ever seen. Special Features: Commentary with
        Phil Bennett, David Duckham and Gareth Edwards.</image:caption
