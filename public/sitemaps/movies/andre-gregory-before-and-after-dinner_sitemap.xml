        >BEFORE AND AFTER DINNER is an exploration of the life and work of Andre
        Gregory, groundbreaking director, actor, artist, and raconteur, filmed
        by prize-winning documentarian Cindy Kleine, his wife. Through her
        close-up lens, Cindy introduces us to this cultural icon and master
        storyteller, and tells the unusual story of a good marriage that thrives
        in collaboration, art, and humor, celebrating the great vitality of the
        later years in life. The film touches on universal questions. Where does
        art come from? What experiences shape the life, the preoccupations, and
        the work of an artist? Drawing on the work Andre has created over a
        lifetime, and exploring the nature of the life that underlies the work,
        BEFORE AND AFTER DINNER is about how and why artists
        create.</image:caption
