        >Dreaming of the dream of the dream is a 16mm projection consisting of
        images of waves that come and go continuously. The artist has assembled
        extracts of cartoons in which water is visible (the sea, bubbles, a
        stream, waves, etc.). Somewhat nostalgic, these extracts can recall
        either childhood cartoons or paintings by Hokusai. The continuous
        movement of the waves echoes the presentation of the film which also
        loops: a metaphor of life, a cyclical and continuous movement which
        nevertheless cannot be altered. The more the film is shown, the more the
        images become worn. The images progressively disappear with the
        scratches on the print. In fact, the work itself has a limited lifespan
        since the artist insists that the film should never be copied and that
        it should be shown until the images have entirely
        disappeared.</image:caption
