        >Things are hectic in heaven. Dozens of scribes sit before a long scroll
        incessantly scribbling away. They are composing the biographies of
        earth-dwellers. What is invented by the men in heaven is lived out
        below. And their employer, God, is increasingly vehement in demanding
        avant-garde ideas. Take, for example, the beautiful Yuri, a girl who
        dies in a car crash. Some of the heavenly scribes find this very dull
        and send former gangster Chas, who has become a heavenly tea-boy, back
        down to earth with instructions to save Yuri no matter what. And so Chas
        ends up in Okinawa, gets to know the earth-dwellers, interferes in their
        fates, becomes celebrated as 'Mr Angel' and is hounded by brutal
        enemies. His falling in love with Yuri is of course a foregone
        conclusion. But no one could anticipate what happens next. Not even God
        himself</image:caption
