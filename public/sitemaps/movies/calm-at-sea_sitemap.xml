        >October 1941. Eighteen months into France’s occupation by German
        troops, young Communist members of the Resistance shoot dead an officer
        of the German Army. In retaliation, Hitler demands the deaths of 150
        Frenchmen, as 'retribution'. The targets are to be mostly young men
        believed to share the assassins’ political convictions. Most of these
        men are taken from an internment camp for opponents of the occupation; a
        35-year-old French rural administrator is ordered to select the victims.
        Although the parish priest appeals to their conscience and moral
        sensibilities, both the German military and their French helpers
        slavishly follow their orders.</image:caption
