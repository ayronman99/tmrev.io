        >B'z LIVE in Namba 2006 was a special event featuring B'z that took
        place on September 1, 2006 at Osaka's Namba Hatch and was one of the
        band's few concerts to be streamed in full for fans over the internet.
        Originally billed as Network LIVE in Japan Supported by dwango: B'z
        Premium Live, the show was the first B'z concert to be streamed from
        Japan, with the band's earlier North American tours in 2002 and 2003
        receiving streaming treatment years earlier. The event was supported by
        ringtone company Dwango, for whom the year's earlier single "SPLASH!"
        served as a commercial theme.</image:caption
