        >Geeta and her parents move to a small town of Hari Nagar where her dad
        has been appointed Principal of a school. During her very first day,
        Geeta finds out that her video gaming device has been stolen. After
        complaining to her school teacher, who ends up searching every student's
        bags, finds the device in Shyam's schoolbag. Shyam is humiliated and
        punished. Then another student, Satish Kumar, the son of Member of
        Legislative Assembly, Makhan Lal Akela, finds that his gold chain is
        missing. They automatically suspect Shyam, and along with local goons
        and Police go to his residence to search for Shyam and the missing
        chain. Shyam's uncle and cruel aunt vehemently deny any theft, but no
        one believes them, they end up searching the house, find Shyam and chase
        him into the lighthouse, where he hides. Shyam does not know that this
        lighthouse is the very venue of a spirit of a dreaded pirate that has
        been lying dormant for 100 years, and is now ready to wake and wreak
        havoc all round again.</image:caption
