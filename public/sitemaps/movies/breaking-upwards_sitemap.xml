        >'Breaking Upwards' explores a young, real-life New York couple who,
        four years in and battling codependency, decide to intricately
        strategize their own break up. Based on an actual experiment devised by
        director/actor Daryl Wein and actress Zoe Lister-Jones, the film loosely
        interprets a year in their lives exploring alternatives to monogamy, and
        the madness that ensues. An uncensored look at young love, lust, and the
        pangs of codependency, 'Breaking Upwards' follows its characters as they
        navigate each others' emotions across the city they love. It begs the
        question: is it ever possible to grow apart together?</image:caption
