        >In a document from November 1st, 1007, Wellerstadt is mentioned for the
        first time verifiably. The royal couple Heinrich and Kunigunde make the
        plan to establish a diocese, with Bamberg at its centre. During the
        imperial synod in Frankfurt in 1007, the bishops approve the plan.
        Heinrich transfers his royal court Forchheim together with 14 villages,
        including Wellerstadt, to the diocese. As “Waldrichesbach”, Wellerstadt
        is not only presumably earlier mentioned in documents than Baiersdorf
        but is in fact older than Baiersdorf. A once presumably Thuringian
        settlement at the river Regnitz has by now become the district of the
        small Franconian town of Baiersdorf: Founded at a ford, destroyed during
        the Thirty Year’s War, rebuild, often flooded by the Regnitz, pushed
        back and forth between the diocese and the margraviate. Waldrichesbach
        has turned into Wellerstadt, an endearing small village in Middle
        Franconia.</image:caption
