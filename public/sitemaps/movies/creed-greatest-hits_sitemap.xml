        >If Nirvana's Nevermind heralded alternative's ascendancy into the
        mainstream, Creed's mega-successful 1997 debut showed just how
        quickly--and craftily--alt.rock's musical hallmarks could be utterly
        co-opted by it. Fueled by vocalist Scott Stapp's Weiland-inspired growl,
        Creed rode the Seattle pop-suffused string of hits included here to
        become one of the 90's most successful rock acts--if one whose level of
        critical revile nearly matched its multi-million sales. This CD/DVD
        combo features 13 of the band's signature performances (including all
        eight of its number one singles), songs that often turn on a
        Christianity-inspired message that could be as opaque (the anthemic
        "Higher") as it was overt ("My Own Prison," "What's This Life For"). The
        accompanying DVD completes the career retrospective, anthologizing nine
        of the band's videos along with previously unreleased live performances
        of "Torn," "Higher" and "Weathered." --Jerry McCulley</image:caption
