        >This award winning documentary, narrated by Lou Reed, explores the
        breadth and depth of Occupy Wall Street and how it quickly grew from a
        small park in lower Manhattan to an international movement. The film
        highlights why people from diverse age, ethnic and financial backgrounds
        support the movement and its focus of removing money from politics in
        order to reclaim democracy from entrenched corporate interests so that
        critical issues including job creation, affordable access to health and
        education, protecting the environment and gun safety can be fully
        addressed. Featuring interviews with a wide range of subjects including
        Occupiers, economist Jeffrey Sachs and business magnate Russell
        Simmons.</image:caption
