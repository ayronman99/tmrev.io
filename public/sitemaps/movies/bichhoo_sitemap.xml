        >Jeeva is a small-time criminal who treasures his solitude, but perky
        girl-next-door Rani works hard to befriend her sullen neighbor. He
        rebuffs all her advances -- until a gang of criminals kills Rani's
        family. In a gross miscarriage of justice, the criminals are set free.
        Jeeva's sympathy for Rani quickly turns into feelings of love, and to
        prove his affection, he trains Rani as a weapons expert so she can
        avenge her murdered family.</image:caption
