        >Tired of his parents’ constant bickering, 15 year old Damien is certain
        they’re all wrong for each other— he would know, he’s a relationship
        expert. Damien and his best friend Erin have a side hustle coupling-up
        classmates for the right price. So when Damien discovers his parents may
        have had a shotgunning wedding, he convinces Erin to turn their efforts
        toward finding his parents new partners— but the cost of doing business
        may come at the price of everyone involved.</image:caption
