        >Three flatmates in Mexico City face uncertainties: Lucía who has a
        great job as an art director for TV commercials is abusing alcohol and
        cocaine. She risks losing her job, going to prison for assault, and
        she's woefully in love with a bullfighter who may be two-timing her.
        Carmen, an artist without income, can be manic - snorting lots of
        cocaine and hanging out with a gay man and a transvestite. What's her
        future? Hanna contemplates divorce from Abraham, a wealthy momma's boy,
        and she's disoriented by feelings of attraction to Sandra, a customer at
        her jewelry store. Can any of these poor little rich girls sort things
        out in a world of excess?</image:caption
