        >Pauline, a beguiling woman in her 60s, returns to her hometown, Turin,
        for the first time since she was ten years old. She has inherited her
        aunt’s apartment in town. In Turin Pauline contacts Dr. Angela
        Gualtieri, a psychologist whom she had met abroad some time before;
        Angela runs a maternity centre, the Melograno, a support centre where
        both mothers to be and young mothers with post natal depression seek
        help. At the Melograno they are constantly short of help, that’s why
        Angela asks Pauline to give her a hand in setting up an in-house archive
        collecting different material relating to maternity: video interviews to
        new mothers, mothers diaries, photo portraits of mother and child.
        Pauline accepts and starts her work plunging deep in an emotional
        material that touches her strongly: the controversial feelings
        experienced by women in their relation with the child.</image:caption
