        >Charming LA architect Harrison, also a great cook and lover, gets
        engaged to Cate, a San Francisco landscape architect he meets while
        collaborating on a major project, after they get locked in by a
        malfunctioning elevator. She moves to LA for him and volunteers, while
        he's on mission in Tokyo, to mind his widowed mother Evelyn, still a
        major force in his life. However Cate gets paranoid when feeling weak
        and hearing rumors that his former girlfriend disappeared mysteriously
        years earlier, even cancels the engagement. Then the truth gets out,
        clearing Harrison and uncovering a lurking danger.</image:caption
