        >From the pioneer days of the Kentucky frontier comes a stew prepared by
        farmers and hunters. They called it Burgoo. No one knows where the name
        comes from, but the folks in Western Kentucky around Owensboro declare
        that the authentic and historical burgoo has to be made with mutton, or
        mature sheep. Folks in central Kentucky prefer beef or wild game. But
        one thing becomes very clear – the passion for whatever is called
        Burgoo, cooked in huge black iron cauldrons, is reflected in the titles
        given to the burgoo masters- they are called “Burgoo Kings”! And their
        reputations last beyond their years, as loyal stew masters rigorously
        maintain recipes and cooking traditions generation to generation. And
        along with making Burgoo comes a lot of leg-pulling, tall tales, and
        fellowship around the pot.</image:caption
