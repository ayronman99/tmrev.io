        >Albert is the story of a tiny Douglas fir tree named Albert who has big
        dreams of becoming Empire City's most famous Christmas tree. When the
        search for this year's tree is announced, Albert believes he has found
        his calling and hits the road with his two best friends, Maisie the
        persistently positive plam tree, and Gene the abrasive and blisteringly
        honest weed, to fulfill his destiny. With a few prickly situations along
        the way, and Cactus Pete out to stop him, Albert learns the true meaning
        of Christmas.</image:caption
