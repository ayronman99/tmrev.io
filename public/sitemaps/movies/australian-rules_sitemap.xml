        >Friends Gary Black (Nathan Phillips) and Dumby Red (Luke Carroll) are
        on the same football team in their coastal Australian town. But to local
        racists, they're a world apart: Gary is white and Dumby is an Aborigine.
        This becomes an issue when one of the team's Aboriginal players becomes
        involved in a crime. In response, Dumby is demoted even though he's the
        star player, and Gary is given his place. Will Gary have the courage to
        speak out before tragedy results?</image:caption
