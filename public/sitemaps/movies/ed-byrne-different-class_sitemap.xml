        >Half toff, half pikey, all comic! Ed Byrne is undoubtedly one of the
        funniest comics working today and his Different Class tour has been his
        most successful show ever. Lauded by critics and audiences alike, this
        blistering one man show takes in such diverse topics as WAGs, Goths, the
        class system and DVD piracy as well as frank and honest tales about Ed s
        upbringing, his parents and his recent nuptials. Filmed in Glasgow, the
        city where he started as a stand up 16 years ago, Different Class shows
        Byrne at the very top of his game and demonstrates why he really is in a
        class of his own.</image:caption
