        >In a town not so far away and a time not so long ago, baby Rose was
        left on the porch of Greenwoods Orphanage, where Mrs. Hartley and the
        children under her tender care become her family. But when tragedy
        strikes, Rose loses the only home she has ever known and she is abruptly
        shipped to Irongates—a place that seems as cold and cruel as her
        previous home was kind. Strict headmaster Mr. Crampton immediately seems
        to dislike Rose and makes sure she and the other children are punished
        for any minor infraction of his rules. Rose soon makes friends with
        Emily, but in spite of her gentle and forgiving nature, some of the
        children will take any chance they can to get her into trouble. When she
        learns that every Christmas Mr. Crampton’s generous brother gives an
        orange to each child, Rose waits in eager anticipation.</image:caption
