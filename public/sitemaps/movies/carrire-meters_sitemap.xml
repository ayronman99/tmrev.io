        >A portrait documentary tracing the inspiration, philosophy and
        imagination of the celebrated theatre and screen writer - and Bunuel's
        long term collaborator - Jean Claude Carrière. Carrière predicts that
        between the house he was born in and the cemetery in which he will end
        there is a life journey of just 250 meters. "Carrière: 250 Meters"
        follows him as he reflects on the wealth of global traditions of
        storytelling, travelling through past and present, across countries and
        cultures from Paris to New York, Mexico and India and joined by his
        family, friends and collaborators. A testament to the life and work of
        an extraordinary man and a key architect in contemporary
        cinema.</image:caption
