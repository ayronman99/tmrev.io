        >It's three years after the events of the original Battle Royale, and
        Shuya Nanahara is now an internationally-known terrorist determined to
        bring down the government. His terrorist group, Wild Seven, stages an
        attack that levels several buildings in Tokyo on Christmas Day, killing
        8000 people. In order for the government to study the benefits of
        "teamwork", the new students work in pairs, with their collars
        electronically linked so that if one of them is killed, the other dies
        as well. They must kill Nanahara in three days - or die.</image:caption
