        >Plagued by the abuse of her past and the turmoil of failed intimate
        encounters, Laura struggles to find a lover and a sense of normalcy. Her
        beacon of hope comes in sixteen year-old Eva, a talented pianist
        disillusioned by the life her mother imposes upon her. An unlikely
        relationship is formed between the two and Eva becomes an obsession to
        Laura. In light of Eva's unhappiness, Laura convinces her to runaway to
        her house and they soon find themselves caught within an intense
        entanglement. Manipulation, denial and codependency fuel what ultimately
        becomes a fractured dynamic that can only sustain itself for so
        long.</image:caption
