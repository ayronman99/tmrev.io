        >Legend tells of a creature unlike any known to man. Some say it's the
        devil's most prized invention. A creature which takes on the
        characteristics of those who have slain it, as well as those which it
        has slain. A creature that can be destroyed again and again only to come
        back stronger every time. A creature named The Sorcalak. Unfortunately,
        seven stereotypical horror film characters on a religious retreat are
        headed straight for it.</image:caption
