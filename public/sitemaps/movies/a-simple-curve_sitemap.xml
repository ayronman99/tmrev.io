        >Caleb is 27, and was raised in the majestic Kootenays by his bush
        hippie parents. He loves his father Jim and understands his reverence
        for wood working, coriander and Soya products, but he just doesn't get
        Jim's determined effort to achieve economic disaster at every turn. His
        father is a relentlessly unsuccessful business man, and as the junior
        partner in their carpentry shop, Caleb is powerless to stop the fiscal
        self sabotage. When Matthew, an old friend of Jim's, arrives in the
        valley to develop a high-end fishing lodge, Caleb sees fortune looming,
        provided he can keep his father distracted long enough. But a small
        deception leads to colossal betrayal, and soon Caleb must face the fact
        that he's reached that treasured day when a boy becomes man enough to
        tell his father get lost.</image:caption
