        >Century 21 moves from the roof of the Winchester house to zoom in on a
        complex of three domed, space-age movie theaters situated across the
        street: Century 21, Century 22 and Century 23, alluding to the fact that
        it is film, TV and the media that perpetuate the icon of the gunfighter.
        The work consists of three short sections intended to represent what is
        “playing” in each of the theaters. These include richly layered montages
        of the Old West and pop-culture imagery, as well as art and film
        celebrities who appear as phantom stand-ins to embody the specters of
        the Cowboy and of Sarah Winchester herself.</image:caption
