        >Jumpers for Goalposts brings together Ed’s captivating performances
        from the biggest shows of his career at Wembley Stadium in July 2015,
        where he wows the 80,000 strong crowd with his biggest hits to date,
        including “The A Team”, “Sing” and “Thinking Out Loud” – and there’s
        even a surprise duet from Sir Elton John. As well as his breath-taking
        onstage performance, Jumpers for Goalposts is intercut with the story of
        Ed’s triumphant road to Wembley, presenting a revealing and personal
        glimpse into life backstage and on the road, along with an honest and
        intimate reflection by Ed – and those closest to him – on just how far
        he has come.</image:caption
