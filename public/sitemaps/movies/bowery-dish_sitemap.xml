        >Bowery Dish is a one-hour video documentary that illuminates the
        complex issues surrounding urban renewal/gentrification on the Bowery in
        a provocative and entertaining fashion. Bowery Dish is a firsthand
        exploration, told by the people at the forefront of change. Everyone
        from the homeless to the recent entrepreneurs gets his or her say;
        conflicting points of view are presented for the viewer to experience
        all sides. Professionally shot and mastered on Beta, Bowery Dish
        includes moments that can only be captured through other related media -
        candid moments in the cramped flophouses are shot digitally while
        historic footage of the Bowery provides context to the changes taking
        place.</image:caption
