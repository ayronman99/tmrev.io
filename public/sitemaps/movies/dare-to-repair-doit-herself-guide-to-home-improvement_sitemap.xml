        >Millions of women and men have never learned to perform basic repairs
        on the ordinary things found around the house or to do the kind of
        preventive maintenance that keeps a household running smoothly and
        efficiently. With humor and easy-to-follow instructions, hosts Julie
        Sussman and Stephanie Glakas-Tenet teach you how to perform basic home
        repairs that will save you thousands of dollars and millions of
        headaches. From the garbage disposal that keeps jamming, to the toilet
        that keeps clogging, to the washer that does the Texas two-step all the
        way across your laundry room floor, this video offers advice on how to
        fix it yourself without asking your partner, neighbor, super, or
        contractor. Includes information on choosing and using tools, repairing
        and maintaining appliances, performing basic plumbing and electrical
        work, and fixing damaged walls, windows, doors and more.</image:caption
