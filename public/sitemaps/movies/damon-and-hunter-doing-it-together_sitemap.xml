        >Comstock Films has created a unique film series that explores sexual
        relationships among couples. Each film focuses on one couple and begins
        with an intimate interview that sets up the background of the couple's
        relationship: how they met, the basis of their intimacy, what attracts
        them sexually to one another, and how they share their innermost desires
        and fantasies. The camera then turns to an intimate lovemaking session,
        recording in detail the passion and eroticism that exists between the
        two. Coverage is explicit, but not provocative; it allows viewers to
        share in the couple's healthy, passionate, romantic relationship and to
        experience first hand the erotic intimacy of their lovemaking. Damon and
        Hunter: Doing it Together features the first gay relationship in the
        series. Damon and Hunter are two adult film stars on the rise, but are
        also real-life lovers.</image:caption
