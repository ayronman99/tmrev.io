        >Pippa is a physically and emotionally scarred former model living as a
        recluse in her meticulous Georgian flat. When a heist taking place in
        the same building goes wrong, Pippa's home is broken into by the
        charismatic Kayleigh. Pippa is taken hostage by this unpredictable and
        volatile thief who's looking for a temporary hideout, but when outside
        forces close in, Kayleigh takes a darker path to get her way. As the
        confined space becomes a fighting ring, in a tense struggle to get out
        Pippa learns how to stand up for herself once again.</image:caption
