        >This film series is produced by Fugazi's Brendan Canty and is directed
        by filmmaker Christoph Green. It features live performances by Wilco,
        Shellac, Tortoise, Freakwater, The Ponys, Lonesome Organist, Tight
        Phantomz, Red Eyed Legends, and Pit er Pat, and was recorded, mixed, and
        curated by producer and Shellac member Bob Weston. In between the bands
        lay shots of the band setting up and portraits of some of the cooler
        aspects of the 100 year old house in Chicago that the DVD was recorded
        in. The final demolition sequence laying waste to the day's events is a
        matter of minutes. Extras include extended slide show of stills of the
        bands and 5.1 mix.</image:caption
