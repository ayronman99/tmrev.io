        >During the Civil War in 17th-Century England, a small group of
        deserters flee from a raging battle through an overgrown field. They are
        captured by an alchemist, who forces the group to aid him in his search
        to find a hidden treasure that he believes is buried in the field.
        Crossing a vast mushroom circle, which provides their first meal, the
        group quickly descend into a chaos of arguments, fighting and paranoia,
        and, as it becomes clear that the treasure might be something other than
        gold, they slowly become victim to the terrifying energies trapped
        inside the field.</image:caption
