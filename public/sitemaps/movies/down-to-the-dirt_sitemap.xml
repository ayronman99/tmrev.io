        >Thirty-year-old Keith Kavanagh (Joel Thomas Hynes) ekes his way through
        life in a small town. A hard-drinking hooligan, he keeps his ragged
        collection of poetry a closely guarded secret... as secret as his regret
        for the shattered relationship with his father. When Keith meets the
        darkly exotic Natasha (Myl√®ne Savoie), his life is changed
        forever.</image:caption
