        >Once upon a time, a Prince was hunting at night, his name was Prince
        Arindal and he encounters a beautiful fairy called Ada. It was love at
        first sight and they fell in love immediately. Arindal decides that he
        should always be at Ada's side in the fairy realm. The Fairy king warns
        that if Arindal should ever leave Ada alone for longer than a year, then
        she will turn into stone. The Prince finds himself having to leave Ada-
        will he be back in time? This "Oper f√ºr Kinder" version has been
        shortened down to a compact 45 minutes from the original 3 hour
        opera.</image:caption
