        >Srinivasan is a young architect. He is happy when he gets a good job
        and a beautiful girlfriend, Tara. But then an accident disfigures him.
        Tara leaves him and Srinivasan, now sans his confidence, withdraws into
        his shell. Then he meets the beautiful Ragini who is willing to accept
        him despite his disfigurement. They get married, but after a while, he
        begins to doubt her true identity.</image:caption
