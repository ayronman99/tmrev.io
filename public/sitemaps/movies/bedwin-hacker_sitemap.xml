        >In the contemporary Tunisian thriller Bedwin Hacker, a female media
        pirate - holed up in a remote outpost in the mountains of Tunisia -
        figures out a way to take over the television and radio airwaves in
        France and North Africa to broadcast political messages. The irritated
        French Intelligence service closes in on her, which leads to a
        tit-for-tat game of intrigue between the hacker and her pursuers. Helmed
        by a female director, this film is of some historical significance,
        given its unusually frank, straightforward, and accurate portrayal of
        the day-to-day experiences of north African women.</image:caption
