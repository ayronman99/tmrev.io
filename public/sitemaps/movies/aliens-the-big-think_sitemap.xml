        >The hunt for aliens is on! After a distinguished career in cosmology
        Professor Martin Rees, the astronomer royal, has taken up the search for
        extra-terrestrials. Looking for aliens is no longer science fiction - it
        is a question that's engaging some of the greatest minds in science. As
        our knowledge of the universe has increased, we're getting closer to
        answers. Many scientists now think we live in galaxy with a billion
        Earth-like planets, many of which may be teeming with life. But what
        kind of life? Has anything evolved into beings we could communicate
        with? This film gets inside the minds of the scientists considering one
        of the most exciting and profound questions we can ask - are we alone in
        the universe? Professor Rees thinks we may have our idea of what an
        alien is like all wrong. If he's right, it's not organic
        extra-terrestrials we should look for, it's machines.</image:caption
