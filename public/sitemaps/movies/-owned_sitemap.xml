        >97% owned present serious research and verifiable evidence on our
        economic and financial system. This is the first documentary to tackle
        this issue from a UK-perspective and explains the inner workings of
        Central Banks and the Money creation process. When money drives almost
        all activity on the planet, it's essential that we understand it. Yet
        simple questions often get overlooked, questions like; where does money
        come from? Who creates it? Who decides how it gets used? And what does
        this mean for the millions of ordinary people who suffer when the
        monetary, and financial system, breaks down? Produced by Queuepolitely
        and featuring Ben Dyson of Positive Money, Josh Ryan-Collins of The New
        Economics Foundation, Ann Pettifor, the "HBOS Whistleblower" Paul Moore,
        Simon Dixon of Bank to the Future and Nick Dearden from the Jubliee Debt
        Campaign.</image:caption
