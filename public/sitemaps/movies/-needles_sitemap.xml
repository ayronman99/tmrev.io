        >At forty years old, Devin Dearth is a successful businessman, a loving
        husband, father of three, a devout Christian and champion bodybuilder.
        He and his family reside in the small community of Central City,
        Kentucky where they live the ideal "American Dream." That is, until
        Devin suffers a devastating stroke. Caused by a bleed in the brain stem,
        the stroke leaves him paralyzed on his right side and unable to walk,
        with difficulty speaking, double vision and inability to care for
        himself or his family. He has met his ultimate adversary: The limits of
        his own mortality. We follow Devin on this unconventional journey,
        during which his courage, faith, patience and desire to overcome are
        tested on a daily basis. The trials he and his family endure along the
        way remind us that the human spirit can transcend any boundaries while
        exploring a universal community of healing and transformation. Written
