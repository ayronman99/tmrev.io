        >Twenty-year-old Eug√®ne is somewhat aimless and has not been doing well
        in university. He is staying in a small village for the summer. He
        awkwardly seduces Pierre, a slightly older man who is working for
        Mathilde as caretaker for the season. Pierre is initially open to the
        relationship, but quickly becomes reluctant to become too
        involved.</image:caption
