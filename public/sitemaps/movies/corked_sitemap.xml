        >"CORKED" ...is a hilarious tale told by documentary filmmakers of four
        distinctly different wineries and their intertwined fate in Northern
        California wine country. A prestigious celebrity wine critic is coming
        to the area and everyone is trying to make sure their wine ends up on
        his golden palate. A diverse group of characters inhabits this region,
        ranging from a fiercely independent "one man show" to an established
        'family' winery where the word family is a registered trademark. An
        eccentric "rich kid" attempts to make his mark in his fathers newly
        acquired vineyard and "two marketing" executives are determined to tap
        into new markets with an edgy high-concept label. We follow this group
        through the toils of harvest, and their quest for recognition leading to
        the Golden Harvest Gala!</image:caption
