        >Wounded in the war, Tommy Donahue and DD Davis return home from Iraq to
        the slum neighborhood they grew up in. Tommy returns to his wife, Faith,
        whom he abandoned while she was pregnant to escape a life of crime.
        Tommy meets his disabled six year-old daughter, Hope, for the first
        time, and she begins to melt his frozen heart. While DD struggles to
        make an honest living, his older brother, Darnell, has risen to become
        the neighborhood kingpin. DD faces the pressure to save his younger
        brother, James, from following in Darnellâ€™s dangerous footsteps. Tommy
        and DD find themselves trapped in the same slum they joined the military
        to escape. As they struggle for redemption, their own families become
        entangled in a web of crime, corruption and violence.</image:caption
