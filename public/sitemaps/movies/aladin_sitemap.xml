        >Based in the municipality of Khwaish, abused by his classmates, Aladin
        Chatterjee, who was orphaned when his parents, Arun and Riya, died in an
        accident in Siachen Valley, lived with his paternal grandfather until
        the later's passing. Now alone, grown up, studying in Khwaish
        University, and still being abused by fellow-college mates, he finds
        himself smitten by the lovely US Exchange Student, Jasmine. Unable to
        express his feelings for her, he rubs a lamp that was gifted to him on
        his birthday, which summons a genie named Genius. He gets 3 wishes, but
        wastes 2 of them, but on the 3rd one he insists that Genius assist him
        to win Jasmine's heart without any magical tricks. Hilarious chaos
        result when everything seems to fail while an immortal and deadly
        entity, Ringmaster, and his hordes, prepares to confront Genius and
        Aladin so that he can acquire more magical powers with the help of the
        lamp on the day of the sighting of a rare comet and the truth behind the
        death of Aladin's parents.</image:caption
