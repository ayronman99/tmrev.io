        >This Argentinian dramedy gives us elements of Woody Allen’s nervous
        comedy and Cassavetes’ melodramatic roller coaster in a storm of egos
        that takes place on one decisive weekend in the lives of Juana, a
        popular actress about to star in an important theater production, and
        her husband Roman, a director suffering from writer’s block. The
        couple’s daughter, Lila, serves as a mirror reflecting her parents’
        frustrations and joys. The long takes, atmospheric music, and stellar
        performances, give a poignant, sometimes hilarious portrayal of a family
        as they attempt to negotiate their egos with their marriage and artistic
        lives.</image:caption
