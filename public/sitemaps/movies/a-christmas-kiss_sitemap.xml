        >Wendy Walton is the best designer in Boston... but no one knows it yet.
        Hoping to kick-start her career, Wendy has left work with the local
        theatre to take a job as an assistant to Priscilla Hall, the most
        prestigious designer in the city. Ms. Hall works Wendy around the clock,
        which is how Wendy finds herself trapped in an elevator late one night
        with an incredibly handsome stranger. Wendy and the mystery man share an
        impulsive, romantic, life changing kiss before the doors open and Wendy
        runs out, leaving him behind. The next day at work, Wendy answers the
        door to find the handsome gentleman standing in front of
        her.</image:caption
