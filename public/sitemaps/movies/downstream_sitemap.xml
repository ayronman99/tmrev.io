        >For decades, two 70-year-old Swiss ladies have been walking and talking
        with each other. In summertime, their daily ritual is to swim down the
        river that flows through their home town. As the current carries them
        down the river, they meditate on friendship, love, and becoming older.
        What will it be like to have to live without one's partner after three
        decades together? They ponder the unthinkable: what will either of them
        do if the other passes away? Their lives are so interwoven after decades
        together that it's hard to imagine. We see them both literally and
        figuratively floating down the river of life together in this moving
        short documentary.</image:caption
