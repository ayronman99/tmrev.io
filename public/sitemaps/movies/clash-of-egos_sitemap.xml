        >Tony has recently been released from a sentence for violent behaviour.
        He promises to improve his ways and is finally granted a few hours alone
        with his two children. They celebrate the reunion by going to the movies
        to see a new film by the famous, critically acclaimed Danish director
        Claus Volter. But the film is not the masterpiece it is said to be on
        the poster; the children are crying and Tony cannot get the money back
        he spent on tickets and candy. Tony does not give up; he seeks out Claus
        Volter in order to get an explanation and a refund. It is however easier
        said than done to get money out of a world-renowned
        filmmaker.</image:caption
