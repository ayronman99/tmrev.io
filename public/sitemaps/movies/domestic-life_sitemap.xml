        >Juliette was simply not sure about coming to live in this residential
        suburb of the greater Paris metropolitan area. All the women here are in
        their forties, have children to raise, houses to keep and husbands who
        return home late at night.Today she has an appointment in Paris that is
        important for her career, but she also has to run errands and pick up
        the kids from school. During the course of her day, monopolized by
        petty, everyday tasks, Juliette can feel the noose of domestic
        obligations and household chores slowly tightening around her
        neck.</image:caption
