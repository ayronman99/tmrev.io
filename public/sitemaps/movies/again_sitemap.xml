        >Mie’s father died during the aftermath of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake
        and tsunami. One day, she finds a bundle of unsent New Year’s cards,
        which languished there for 28 years. To find out why the cards were
        never sent, Mie tracks down Haruhiko Sakacho. Haruhiko played on the
        same high school baseball team with her father. Mie eventually gathers
        together her father's former teammates to play in the Masters Koshien (a
        senior league baseball tournament). Mie also uncovers a truth about her
        father and the baseball team.</image:caption
