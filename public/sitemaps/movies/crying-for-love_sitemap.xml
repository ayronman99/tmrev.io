        >Three girls meet by chance in a hospital. Struggling to come to terms
        with their fate, they all look back on a decisive moment in their life:
        Sara, a professional swimmer relentlessly urged on by her ambitious
        father, was deprived of her only real chance of happiness. Mette has
        left her deeply religious family, finding it too hard to bear that they
        have accepted her fate while she hasn't. And Stephanie has brutally
        rejected her boyfriend in fear of being rejected herself. Although their
        stories are very different, the three girls are brought together in
        their search for love and companionship. Based on the Oscar nominated
        short fiction »At Night«</image:caption
