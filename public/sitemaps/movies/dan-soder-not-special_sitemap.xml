        >In Dan Soder's first hour-long special, he reveals the creepiest thing
        about his grandmother, admits that his recent breakup was his fault and
        remembers the hardest thing about being raised by a single mom.
        Throughout his special, Soder is so laid-back and charming that you'll
        be grateful he wasn't actually possessed by the devil that one
        time.</image:caption
