        >Berlin in June of 1940. While Nazi propaganda celebrates the regime’s
        victory over France, a kitchen-cum-living room in Prenzlauer Berg is
        filled with grief. Anna and Otto Quangel’s son has been killed at the
        front. This working class couple had long believed in the ‘Führer’ and
        followed him willingly, but now they realise that his promises are
        nothing but lies and deceit. They begin writing postcards as a form of
        resistance and in a bid to raise awareness: Stop the war machine! Kill
        Hitler! Putting their lives at risk, they distribute these cards in the
        entrances of tenement buildings and in stairwells. But the SS and the
        Gestapo are soon onto them, and even their neighbours pose a
        threat.</image:caption
