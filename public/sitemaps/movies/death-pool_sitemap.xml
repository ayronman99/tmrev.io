        >Johnny Taylor has a big problem: he LOVES to drown good-looking girls.
        When he sees water and attractive females together, something in his
        head begs him to kill - the psychological result of a traumatic
        near-drowning during his childhood at the hands of a twisted babysitter.
        Fighting the urge to act on his sinister thoughts most of his adult
        life, Johnny finally succumbs to his dark instincts when the only work
        he can find is around water, cleaning pools. Filled with colorful
        characters, beautiful women and set against the backdrop of the LA party
        scene, Death Pool encapsulates the desire for fame, the lust for desire,
        and the urge to kill.</image:caption
