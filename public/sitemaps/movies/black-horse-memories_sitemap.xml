        >A group of young people are trying to teach Kurdish in Turkish
        Kurdistan, a land where the teaching of the language is forbidden by
        Turkish authorities. Part of their work is to print clandestine
        schoolbooks in underground schools and distribute them. One of the girls
        in the group, Aseke, is killed on a mission and her friends decide to
        carry out the final request she made in her will. She had been brought
        up with a black horse, now in the remote Anatolian mountains, and her
        request is to bring the horse back so that they might meet one last time
        before she is buried. The arrival of the horse leads to some unexpected
        events.</image:caption
