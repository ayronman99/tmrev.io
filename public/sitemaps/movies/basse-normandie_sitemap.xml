        >Basse Normandie is based on actual events. Protagonists Simon Reggiani
        and Patricia Mazuy are also husband and wife in real life. They filmed
        the creation of one of Simon’s plays, and then reenacted some of the
        events surrounding it. Simon prepares for a one-man show that he will
        perform largely on horseback, including dressage. The local government
        of the region hopes to use the play to improve its image; with
        government’s support, it’s decided that Simon will perform the play
        before an audience of over 1,700 farmers during an agricultural congress
        in Paris. The director of a large stud farm provides Simon with
        rehearsal space. What follows is the path that Reggiani had to take in
        order to create his performance — a path filled with obstacles ranging
        from uncooperative stable staff and a grumpy horse to vocal problems. An
        intriguing and occasionally absurd mixture of filmed theater, a
        making-of documentary, mockumentary and dressage lesson.</image:caption
