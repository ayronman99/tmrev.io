        >Orphaned from an early age and taken in by her aunt Em, Dorothy suffers
        from the absence of her parents. One morning, a cyclone hits his village
        and Dorothy has no time to take refuge in the family shelter. The
        cyclone takes it with the house to a faraway land, an unreal world
        populated by extraordinary characters. As soon as she arrives, she has
        only one idea in mind, to go home to find her aunt. How do I do that? No
        one has the power to help her get home. No one except perhaps a strange
        and fantastic character who has lived for years in the Emerald City, the
        Wizard of Oz.</image:caption
