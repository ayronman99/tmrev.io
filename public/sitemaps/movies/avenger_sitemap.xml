        >After his own daughter was killed in Panama in 1994, former CIA agent
        Calvin Dexter became a private 'specialist' in cases which wouldn't
        reach justice trough the regular legal channels. Two years later he
        accepts to find Richard 'Ricky' Edmunds for his pa, influential rich
        businessman Stephen Edmonds. Ricky for a private Canadian war victims
        charity in Bosnia and went missing. Dexter discovers Ricky was beaten to
        pulp and drowned for no other crime then helping street boys from the
        other side by Zoran Zilic and his Serbian paramilitary 'order'. He
        offers Steven to 'finish the job' as such war criminals don't go to
        trial. But deputy CIA director Paul Devereaux cares only for a nuclear
        arms project he wants to use Zilic for. So CIA troubleshooter Frank
        McBride is ordered to protect him and handle Dexter.</image:caption
