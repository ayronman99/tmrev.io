        >A documentary film showing the oldest street in Lhasa, Bajiao St., also
        called Bakhor or Baghor), located in the town center. In the past,
        Bajiao was only used as a ritual circumambulation route, "a saint road"
        in the eyes of the Tibetans. Now it's developed into an old shopping
        district with colorful Tibetan houses lining the street, and the ground
        paved with man-made flagstones, preserving its ancient look. The film
        also shows the social conditions, customs, and spirtual lives of the
        Tibetan inhabitants.</image:caption
