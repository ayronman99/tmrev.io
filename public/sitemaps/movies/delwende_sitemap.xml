        >After a young boy dies of meningitis, Napoko Diarrha (Yam√©ogo) is
        accused of eating his soul because of a local sexist tradition. While
        this happens, her husband feels disgraced that Diarrha resists the idea
        of marrying off their daughter, so he exactes his revenge by spreading a
        dangerous rumor that would probably get her killed. Because of this,
        Diarrha's fate falls into the village elder's hands. When she finds out
        she will go trial, she decides to flee to the nearest town, Ouagadougou,
        before that can take place. After successfully leaving her village,
        Diarrha's age causes her health to decline, while her daughter grows up.
        Some time later, her daughter decides to travel to Ouagadougou, in
        search of her missing mother. Once they are reconnected, they attempt to
        escape from their male-dominated society.</image:caption
