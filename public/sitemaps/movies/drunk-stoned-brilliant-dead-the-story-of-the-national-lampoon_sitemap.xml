        >A look at the history of the American comedy publication and production
        company, National Lampoon, from its beginning in the 1970s to 2010,
        featuring rare and never before seen footage, this is the mind boggling
        story of The National Lampoon from its subversive and electrifying
        beginnings, to rebirth as an unlikely Hollywood heavyweight, and beyond.
        A humour empire like no other, the impact of the magazines irreverent,
        often shocking, sensibility was nothing short of seismic: this is an
        institution whose (drunk stoned brilliant) alumni left their
        fingerprints all over popular culture. Both insanely great and
        breathtakingly innovative, The National Lampoon created the foundation
        of modern comic sensibility by setting the bar in comedy impossibly
        high.</image:caption
