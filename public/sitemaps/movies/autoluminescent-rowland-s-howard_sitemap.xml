        >From myth to legend Rowland Howard appeared on the early Melbourne punk
        scene like a phantom out of Kafkaesque Prague or Bram Stoker’s Dracula.
        A beautifully gaunt and gothic aristocrat, the unique distinctive fury
        of his guitar style shot him directly into the imagination of a
        generation. He was impeccable, the austerity of his artistry embodied in
        his finely wrought form, his obscure tastes and his intelligently wry
        wit. He radiated a searing personal integrity that never seemed to
        tarnish. Despite the trials and tribulations of his career, in an age of
        makeover and reinvention, Rowland Howard never ‘sold out’. With recent
        and moving interviews, archival interviews and other fascinating and
        original footage, AUTOLUMINESCENT traces the life of Rowland S Howard.
        Capturing moments with the man himself and intimate missives from those
        who knew him behind closed doors; words and images etch light into what
        has always been the mysterious dark.</image:caption
