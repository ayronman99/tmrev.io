        >Coolies: How Britain Reinvented Slavery tells the astonishing and
        controversial story of the systematic recruitment and migration of over
        a million Indians to all corners of the Empire. It is a chapter in
        colonial history that implicates figures at the very highest level of
        the British establishment and has defined the demographic shape of the
        modern world. Combining archive footage and historical evidence the
        programme includes interviews with Gandhi’s great-grandaughter, Uma
        Dhupelia-Mesthrie, about Gandhi’s campaign to end indentured labour and
        David Dabydeen – author and academic – whose great-grandfather was an
        indentured labourer in British Guyana. Coolies: How Britain Reinvented
        Slavery traces family stories through epic voyages across South America,
        the South Pacific and Africa, as descendants investigate their past and
        trace the last surviving witnesses.</image:caption
