        >Edith Walks is a 60 minute 66 second feature film inspired by a walk
        from Waltham Abbey in Essex via Battle Abbey to St Leonards-on-Sea in
        East Sussex. The film documents a pilgrimage in memory of Edith Swan
        Neck. The 108 mile journey, as the crow flies, allows the audience to
        reflect upon all things Edith. A conversation in Northampton between
        Alan Moore, Iain Sinclair and Edith Swan Neck is also a key element to
        the unfolding 'story'. With images shot using digital super 8 iPhone's
        and sound recorded using a specially constructed music box with a boom
        microphone the film unfolds chronologically but in a completely
        unpredictable way. The numerous encounters and impromptu performances en
        route are proof, as if needed, that the angels of happenstance were to
        looking down upon the troop, with EDITH as their
        hallucination</image:caption
