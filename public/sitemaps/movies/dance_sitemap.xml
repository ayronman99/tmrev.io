        >This film begins with points of light defining a dark space out of
        which a female dancer (Vivienne Palmer) emerges dressed in a
        semi-transparent green dress. Her dance is visually 'echoed' by close-up
        superimpositions of her arms, legs, and feet, and then later by her
        distant figure seeming to mimic and/or perhaps to control her
        foregrounded, cometimes back-lit, image. She often pauses thoughtfully
        in her dance, breaks step, walks away, etc., defining the perimeters of
        the dance. Finally she appears naked, midst dance, and takes heraldic
        stance at end.</image:caption
