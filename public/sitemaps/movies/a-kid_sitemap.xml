        knew has died and decides to go to his funeral in order to meet his two
        siblings in Quebec. But once in Montréal, he realizes that nobody is
        aware of his existence or even interested in it. He is alone, in hostile
        territory…Filled with secrets, this story about one man’s coming to term
        with the foreign family he never knew he had is complex with
        interconnected themes such as masculinity, family, paternity and filial
        devotion coiling in the layers underneath.</image:caption
