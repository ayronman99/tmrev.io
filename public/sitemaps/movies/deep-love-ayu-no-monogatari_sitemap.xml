        >Ayu, a young prostitute has lived a meaningless life until she met a
        young boy named Yoshiyuki. They met when an old lady who taught her the
        meaning of life passed away, only briefly telling her of her grandson,
        Yoshiyuki. Knowing that the old lady wished only to see her grandson but
        is unable to grant the old lady her wish, Ayu then thought that she
        could take care of Yoshiyuki for her. Ayu and Yoshiyuki, despite his
        heart problems and her dark past love each other to the fullest.
        However, life wasn't easy for the both of them. Yoshiyuki's father
        forbids their relationship and kept them away from each other. But Ayu
        sacrificed herself by becoming a prostitute once again to earn money for
        Yoshiyuki's operation and to keep her promise to the old woman who
        changed her life.</image:caption
