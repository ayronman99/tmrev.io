        >The Ainu are the indigenous people of Japan. Hokkaido, the northern
        island of Japan, was previously called Ainumosir, or land of the Ainu.
        Ainu traditions are facing a critical situation; the latest survey
        revealed that the Ainu population is less than 20,000 people in
        Hokkaido, and UNESCO has recognized the language as ‘critically
        endangered.’ This documentary was filmed in Biratori town in Hokkaido,
        where many people with Ainu roots still live. It is also known as the
        hometown of the late Shigeru Kayano, who contributed greatly to the
        field of research on Ainu culture.</image:caption
