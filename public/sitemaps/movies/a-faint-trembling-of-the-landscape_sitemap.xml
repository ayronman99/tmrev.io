        >As the world begins to explore the unknown regions outside our
        atmosphere, great events are reflected in the everyday actions in a
        small French community in this experimental comedy-drama from filmmaker
        Philippe Fernandez. It's the early 1960's, and while Americans and
        Russians are racing to be the first in outer space, the people who live
        in a small town can't contain their fascination with the exploration of
        the cosmos. School children draw pictures of the moon, a repairman
        thinks he's found evidence of alien life forms, weekend painters develop
        a new perspective on the sky, kids get into the game by cobbling
        together a homemade spaceship, and a teacher obsessed with auto racing
        thinks he knows the secret behind some strange terrestrial
        events.</image:caption
