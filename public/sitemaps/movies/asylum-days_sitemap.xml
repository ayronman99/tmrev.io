        >The nightmares are always the same for Hollywood actress Laurie
        Cardell: she's back at the orphanage where she spent her childhood,
        being tortured by the head mistress, praying for an escape. But that's
        all in the past... until two brothers decide to bring the screen siren
        back to the scene of the crime. Daniel has been silently stalking Laurie
        for years, and when his psychotic brother Nathan is released from
        prison, no one expects the horror he brings. Daniel's misguided attempts
        to mend the wounds of a tortured youth resurrect Laurie's childhood
        nightmares and force Daniel to confront his own obsession, while
        Nathan's twisted logic takes on demonic proportions.</image:caption
