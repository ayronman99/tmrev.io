        >Expectant parents become prime suspects in the disappearance of a
        pregnant woman who was last seen at their garage sale. Model citizen
        David Rose runs a garden center and is a devoted house-father. Like his
        wife Ivy, who suffered two stillbirths, their new neighbor Melinda is
        near to giving birth. Just after David showed her around in the Rose
        home, Melinda goes missing. Although no corpse is found, just
        circumstantial evidence more likely to be planted then stupidly left
        behind, police detective Blanchard treats David as his sole suspect,
        soon arrested, even after nosy neighbor Bindel is knocked down while
        David is in jail. School buddy Theo does his best to counsel the couple,
        yet Ivy doubts her husband's innocence just because of indications he
        may have had an affair with Melinda since high-school, and starts
        snooping with her best friend Jody. The worst crime is still being
        hatched.</image:caption
