        >After his retirement, french philosopher and bullfighting enthusiast
        Francis Wolff decides to embark on a journey to France, Spain and Mexico
        joined by two mexican filmmakers who hardly know anything about
        bullfighting, a culture whose days seem to be numbered. During their
        road trip, they encounter numerous personalities with whom they reflect

        life itself.</image:caption
