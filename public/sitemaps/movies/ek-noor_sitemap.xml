        >'Ek Noor' is a sincere attempt to bring across the audience the message
        on the noble cause of organ donation and a sincere attempt to make the
        audience aware of life after death. The gift of living your life through
        the life of another brings immense joy, satisfaction and blessings, it
        gives both to the person who does the good deed and to the one who
        receives it. Its a simple story of a visually impaired orphaned girl,
        Rabia who is offered a better life when a young couple makes a conscious
        decision of adopting her and she fills the vacuum in their lives. Then
        through a twist of circumstances when the protagonist comes to know she
        is going to die, she makes two important decisions that would change
        Rabia's life and another young woman's life.</image:caption
