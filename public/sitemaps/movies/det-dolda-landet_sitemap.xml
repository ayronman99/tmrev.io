        >Andrzej and Teresa live in Sweden. They come from Poland and work black
        with what work they can get hold of. They live Spartan in a rental room
        that they must not disclose where it is located. They want to start a
        new life in Sweden but do not have a contract for a white job and
        therefore no Social Security numbers. In the film we follow Andrzej and
        Teresa on their way between different Swedish authorities in the fight
        for a Social Security number and the last four numbers. At the same
        time, they meet Jacek, who has lived and worked black in Sweden for 8
        years. He lives alone in a basement. He is stuck in the black job and
        dreams of getting the power to change his situation.</image:caption
