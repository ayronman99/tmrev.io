        >A look at man's relationship with Dirt. Dirt has given us food,
        shelter, fuel, medicine, ceramics, flowers, cosmetics and color
        --everything needed for our survival. For most of the last ten thousand
        years we humans understood our intimate bond with dirt and the rest of
        nature. We took care of the soils that took care of us. But, over time,
        we lost that connection. We turned dirt into something "dirty." In doing
        so, we transform the skin of the earth into a hellish and dangerous
        landscape for all life on earth. A millennial shift in consciousness
        about the environment offers a beacon of hope - and practical
        solutions.</image:caption
