        >Before Bad Brains, the Sex Pistols or even the Ramones, there was
        Death. Formed in the early '70s by three teenage brothers from Detroit,
        Death is credited as being the first black punk band, and the Hackney
        brothers, David, Bobby, and Dannis, are now considered pioneers in their
        field. But it wasn’t until recently — when a dusty 1974 demo tape made
        its way out of Bobby’s attic nearly 30 years after Death’s heyday — that
        anyone outside a small group of punk enthusiasts had even heard of
        them.</image:caption
