        >Toru grew up in alpine countryside around Mount Tate. As a child, he
        resented the yearly trek up the mountain with his father to prepare
        their mountain hut for the summer season of climbers. When Toru grows
        up, he leaves his hometown and enters the working world as a stock
        trader. One day, Toru receives word that his father has passed away. He
        returns to Mount Tate once again, and becomes conscious of a new
        calling. But, does Toru have what it takes to follow in his father
        footsteps?</image:caption
