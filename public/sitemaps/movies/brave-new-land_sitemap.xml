        >Diogo is a cartographer and artist who is encharged to set the new
        frontiers of Portuguese Colonies in South America. When he reaches the
        center of the continent, finds apparently nothing but wilderness and
        ‘uncivilized’ natives with strange ways of living. But Captain Pedro,
        the rude scout who guides him through the jungle, involves Diogo in an
        involuntary act of violence which will tie him in an unusual way to that
        far away country. At the same time, the Portuguese colonists are trying
        to make peace with Guaicuru Indians (one of the few natives with
        horse-riding abilities). But peace doesn’t ever have a low
        price.</image:caption
