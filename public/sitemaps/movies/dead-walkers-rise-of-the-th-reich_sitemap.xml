        >In 1945 the Second World War came to an end and the Nazis fled.
        Scientists and military elite escaped across borders and found
        themselves in new worlds. Some fled to Russia, some the United States
        and others to South America. But there was another division, a forgotten
        group. A top secret and powerful team of men and women formed in the
        womb of the Nazi Occult. Now, decades after the war, their work is
        nearing completion. The 4th Reich is ready. It's more powerful and
        destructive than ever before. An army of hell is coming. Only one man
        knows the truth. His mission now, is to convince the world. Based on
        years of occult research and insider knowledge, Dead Walkers is a film
        packed with spies, soldiers, Nazis and secrets. But also a very dark and
        mysterious army raised in the pit of Nazi hell.</image:caption
