        >Genoa 2001: As the G8 Summit drew to a close and the press and
        politicians departed, 300 riot police stormed the Diaz School looking
        for members of the infamous Black Block. They found instead young
        activists, mostly students, teenagers and journalists from around Europe
        preparing to bunk down in the school gym. Undeterred, they unleashed a
        calculated frenzy of violence, beating young and old, male and female
        indiscriminately. Those seriously injured were rushed to the hospital in
        ambulances, though soon after they were forced to join those who had
        been arrested and driven to a detention centre and subjected to further
        abuse and degradation.</image:caption
