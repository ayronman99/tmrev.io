        >Kapa, Pepe and Mesi would like to buy a scrapyard of trains, to start a
        nostalgia train and earn a lot of money. The capital to start with they
        want to get from grandpa, who has come home from America with a suitcase
        full of money. Everybody wants Mesi to approach the old man, because she
        is the only one he would speak to. But Mesi is more concerned with the
        idea that she wants a child, by now from anyone, while Pepe is jealous.
        Kapa’s alleged son emerges, with the mafia behind him: they, too, are
        eager to get grandpa’s money. After threats and blackmailing, poisoned
        apples are sent, with only one side of them poisonous. Those dead, by
        the way, are resurrected by the sound of a song. At last, nobody manages
        to get the money, but it wouldn’t make sense anyway: it’s all fake. The
        Statue of Liberty, however, turns out to be blind.</image:caption
