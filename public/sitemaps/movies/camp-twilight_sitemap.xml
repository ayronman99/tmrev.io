        >After discovering they are at risk of failing to graduate, six students
        agree to a weekend camping trip for extra credit. Lead by their
        teachers, Ms. Bloom and Mr. Warner, the students arrive at Camp Twilight
        and discover its past. The park has a dangerous and notorious history
        and the students soon discover these stories are more than just urban
        legends. After a series of "accidents," the remaining group discovers
        they are being hunted and must stick together to survive.</image:caption
