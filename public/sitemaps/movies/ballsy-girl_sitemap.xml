        >Nour is a pleasant and funny person who works as an accountant at a
        fitness center in Paris. Everybody likes her, but she has no luck in her
        romantic endeavours because she is overweight with atypical looks. Her
        close friends try to give her advice, but they are not particularly
        successful in the love department either. Her mother and brother are
        also close, but they are of no help, rather the contrary. One day she
        witnesses a pole dancing class at her workplace, something that she
        would never dream of doing herself, but she sees how much the women in
        the class and their teacher are enjoying themselves, so she is tempted.
        Finally the teacher starts giving her private lessons since she is too
        ashamed of her body to do anything in public. Slowly but surely she
        gains confidence in herself and many things change in her
        life.</image:caption
