        >Britney Spears: In the Zone is a busy batch of Britney-mania, much of
        it featuring Spears in crisp dance numbers supplemented by
        behind-the-scenes glimpses and chatter. The heart of the show is an ABC
        television special featuring live performances of "Toxic," "Breathe on
        Me," and "I'm a Slave 4 U." A fun highlight is Spears's hip-hop
        collaboration with the Ying Yang Twins on "(I Got That) Boom Boom," one
        of the few numbers in the star's stage repertoire with a little room for
        spontaneity. Between songs one finds Spears gushing over her
        grandfather, praising her entourage, describing the emotional toll of
        being in the public eye, and writing songs.</image:caption
