        >The film tells about the famous monument to the Soviet
        soldier-liberator "Alyosha" in the Bulgarian city of Plovdiv. The idea
        to build a monument on Bunardzhik Hill in honor of Soviet
        soldiers-liberators was born among the residents of Plovdiv back in
        1948. The initiative came entirely from "below", from the people,
        without any recommendation from "above". On May 9, 1948, the Citywide
        Initiative Committee for the construction of a monument to Soviet
        soldiers was established, which included public figures, architects,
        artists, writers and teachers. It was headed by the head of the Plovdiv
        military garrison, General Asen Grekov. On the same day, the symbolic
        laying of the base of the monument was made.</image:caption
