        >For more than a century people have refreshed themselves with oceans of
        brown fluid. Much of this fluid was produced by one Atlanta-based
        company, and Coca-Cola: The History of an American Icon offers a
        panegyric to the Real Thing. The history of Coke is the history of its
        advertising, and this documentary draws on a rich archive of print,
        film, and television material to show how John Pemberton's soda recipe
        became such a potent symbol of American society. Coca-Cola: The History
        of an American Icon is, unsurprisingly, a one-sided history. There is no
        suggestion that the Coca-Colonization of the planet might have a
        downside, and lines like "If the world's having a bad time, it's OK
        because there's still Coke" are delivered without a hint of irony.
        Nevertheless, this documentary offers some fascinating insights into the
        history of Coca-Cola.</image:caption
