        >A documentary structured around private and poetic letters to her son
        from the feminist activist filmmaker, Alexandra Juhasz. The film shows
        the present situation of the director and five of her friends who went
        to university together. The women, who shared a set of values and a
        common faith under the feminist political umbrella, now live their own
        lives with their own families. Each of them struggles to define ‘family
        values’ in her own words, free from traditional heterosexuality,
        femininity, and religion.</image:caption
