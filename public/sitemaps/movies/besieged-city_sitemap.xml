        >Ling-Kit HO is just like one of many other students in Tin Shui Wai.
        However, he is a lot more hard-working than all the others as he wants
        to get away from this besieged city. Apart from his study, he is
        indifferent to everything because he comes from a defunct family. Having
        to take care of his mentally-ill mother, Ling Kit is also forced to face
        his Dad â€“ a heavy drunker and a heavy gambler. His younger brother
        Chun-Kit has left the family for years. At that time, Chun-Kit was
        heavily bullied by his classmates in school and he was always beaten by
        his drunken father. Being the elder brother, however, Ling-Kit did not
        protect Chun-Kit from being beaten so Chun-Kit left in great
        panic.</image:caption
