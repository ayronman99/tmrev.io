        >In Los Angeles, the young Jenny has a nice childhood with her Korean
        parents Joanne and David Kim. However, after the divorce of her parents,
        the judge gives her custody to her selfish mother that neglects Jenny
        while the disappointed David returns to Seoul. Six years later, Jenny is
        a troubled and reckless teenager expelled from the public school that
        has easy sex and uses drugs and booze, and her best friend is the orphan
        drug dealer Becky. The lawyer Elliot Krasner decides to call his former
        friend David to tell him about the self-destructive behavior of Jenny,
        and David returns to Los Angeles. He brings Jenny to live with him and
        support her, but the lack of emotional structure of Jenny imposes tough
        difficulties for their relationship.</image:caption
