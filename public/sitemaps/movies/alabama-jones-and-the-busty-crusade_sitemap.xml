        >Alabama Jones, Oklahoma Jones, and California Jones are three sexy
        adventurers who hunt ancient treasures for a museum curator. They manage
        to defeat the floating flaming skulls that had killed previous treasure
        hunters and take the idol of Punani. Their next assignment is to find a
        drunken tracker named "Jungle Bill" and convince him to lead them to the
        Golden Mango of Tantu. During their quest they encounter sexy jungle
        goddesses, gorillas, natives, a hunky jungle man, a giant scorpion, lost
        aviator Amelia Airhead, and others while pausing frequently to enjoy
        erotic delights.</image:caption
