        >Four best friends. They've been to war, they've seen life, but they are
        still passionate, young and willing to serve their country. They found
        their place at OMON - Russian Special Police Squad. They can count only
        on each other, and their real family is themselves. After working hours
        they become simple guys with ordinary dreams like family and comfort.
        But life changes when once in a night club the friends incidentally get
        in a fight with the local mafia. It turns out that they have no fear and
        they are ready to stand for each other whatever happens.</image:caption
