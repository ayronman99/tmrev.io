        >A vanity project by Wexford-based comedian Barry O'Neill, starring and
        directing and writing. About Ireland's answer to Inspector Clouseau,
        supported by a cast of Irish stars who were presumably roped into this
        to help Barry. A bumbling wannabe private detective investigates the
        mysterious disappearance of a fiddle player much to the irritation of
        police officers who have been assigned to the case. The private
        detective finds himself in over his head when evidence points to a
        Russian mobster.</image:caption
