        >Gon-bong cut the leg of a competing mafia group's boss and got on the
        bad side of the number two of his own group. Out of desperation, he
        jumps in front of Sae-ju's car. Sae-ju is also suicidal, a former doctor
        who lost his wife and child due to his mistake. He meets Jae-rim who has
        a terminal disease but remains optimistic. They all lead very different
        lives, but they feel curiosity about each other.</image:caption
