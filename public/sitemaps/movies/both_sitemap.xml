        >Rebeca Duarte is a strong woman and resolute bisexual. Drawn to the
        risk and adrenaline-rush that her job provides, outsiders think Rebeca
        must have it all together. But Rebeca is still looking for something
        more. When she receives an unexpected package from an aunt, Rebeca’s
        neatly wrapped life begins to unravel. The package contains a photo
        album of her family in Peru, including pictures of her brother, who died
        before Rebeca could know him. The photos set off memories that cannot be
        silenced. As she follows the leads, Rebeca learns a truth about herself
        that shakes her to the core: the brother she was always told about was,
        in fact, herself. Rebeca learns of her childhood diagnosis as a
        hermaphrodite and the ensuing surgery that turned her “officially” into
        a girl. A compelling and skillful telling of a necessary story, BOTH is
        based on the experiences of the filmmaker as well as those of many other
        intersex adults.</image:caption
