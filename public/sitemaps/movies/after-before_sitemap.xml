        >A documentary that takes a look at the production of BEFORE MIDNIGHT.
        As the film starts, Richard Linklater, Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke are
        sitting around as filming has just completed. From here we get some
        terrific stories as they talk about the characters as well as what they
        bring and take from them. We also get footage from the filming of the
        movie where we get to see how the actors and director work together to
        try and build up the scenes.</image:caption
