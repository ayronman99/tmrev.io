        >The Burn to Shine series is about time. Portraits of bands playing in
        doomed houses, and the ritual of demolition set to music. These films
        always had in them a giant underlined subtext of temporality. This
        newest release, the Atlanta edition, is different in one major way. It
        is now being released almost a full decade after being filmed. The
        implied time capsule of the earlier films becomes explicit in this one,
        allowing us to view well known bands like Mastadon, Deerhunter, The
        Black Lips, and the Coathangers, in their infancy. Like finding an
        undeveloped roll of baby pictures, Burn to Shine 6: Atlanta takes us to
        a place that we forgot even existed.</image:caption
