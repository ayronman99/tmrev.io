        >Thanks to some Christmas magic, Emma gets to experience two different
        Christmases – one where she stays in the city and celebrates with a new
        crush and his friends, and one where she returns home for all the
        traditions with her family…and Drew, a longtime friend who may have
        feelings for her. Emma’s double holiday ultimately helps her discover
        what will truly make her happy in life as well as in
        love.</image:caption
