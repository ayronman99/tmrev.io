        >For years, people have been making home movies, many times using pop
        culture properties that they may not own, but love. In recent years,
        these types of projects have come to be known as "fanfilms". Backyard
        Blockbusters looks at the history and influence of the fanfilm genre, as
        well as the copyright and fair use problems these films create,
        featuring highlights from and interviews with the creators of many
        popular films.</image:caption
