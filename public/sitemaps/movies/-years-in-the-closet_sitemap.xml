        >Loraine Barr was born in 1918 and kept her sexuality secret for 88
        years. When she revealed the truth in Newsweek magazine in 2007 she set
        the blogs ablaze and challenged us to ask: Is she really brave,
        courageous and bold as admirers have told her in countless letters since
        the story appeared? Or is she a coward - as others have written - only
        coming out of the closet when nothing was truly at risk? This short film
        tells the story of Loraine Barr, following her as she prepares to join
        1800 other women on an 'Olivia' lesbian-only cruise out of San
        Diego.</image:caption
