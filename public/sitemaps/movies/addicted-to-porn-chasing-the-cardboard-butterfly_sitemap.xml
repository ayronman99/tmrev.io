        >Like it or not, porn is here and it is harmful. In this controversial
        film, award-winning filmmaker Justin Hunt dissects the impact of
        pornography on societies around the globe, from how it affects the brain
        of the individual, to how modern technology leads to greater exposure to
        youth, to watching it literally tear a family apart. In what may well be
        one of the most devastating issues in modern culture, this film will
        break down the damage that porn is doing to us a human race and leave
        you thinking that it's clearly time that we start taking porn addiction
        a bit more seriously.</image:caption
