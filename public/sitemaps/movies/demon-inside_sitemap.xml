        >Marta used to be a recognized and successful psychic, but after a
        dramatic experience, she loses faith in her gift and develops
        agoraphobia. She couldn't see the devilish side of her rapper, Mario,
        and now, Marta is afraid that Mario will stalk her again. As soon as she
        released from the asylum, she moves to Monica's uncle apartment. There,
        she feels safe. But soon, she has trouble with her crazy neighbors. And
        if this wasn't enough, a spectrum starts to haunt her, making her life
        impossible. Marta will have to fight against all these difficulties and
        manage to get her gift back before Mario finds her.</image:caption
