        >Maravan, aged 24, is a Tamil asylum seeker in Switzerland, working as
        casual help in a highly rated, gourmet restaurant in Zurich. It is also
        well below his own standards, because he is a gifted and highly
        passionate cook. In Sri Lanka his grandmother initiated him in the
        culinary arts, not least in the secrets of aphrodisiacal cuisine. When
        Maravan loses his job his colleague Andrea persuades him into a deal of
        the special kind: a joint catering venture for love
        menus.</image:caption
