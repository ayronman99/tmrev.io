        >In a California memorabilia shop in 2010, collector Randy Guijarro
        bought a tintype that looked to be a familiar figure, Billy the Kid -
        playing croquet with his gang known as The Regulators. As the gravity of
        the discovery began to set in, Guijarro initiated a chain of events that
        would lead him on a painstaking journey to verify the photograph's
        authenticity.</image:caption
