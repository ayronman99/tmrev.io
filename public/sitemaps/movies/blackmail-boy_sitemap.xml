        >In the small, closed community of a provincial town, Magda tries to
        maintain a balance within a family facing many serious problems. The
        families apparently normal, bourgeois, every-day life will crack open,
        bringing to the surface hatred and passions of the kind that lie
        well-hidden in the mists of the nearby lake. An intense plot and a
        totally unexpected ending make up this film, which features characters
        who are vulnerable, innocent and ordinary, but who become ruthless and
        callous, worrying only about protecting their financial resources. The
        offences are disproportionately serious compared to the financial
        benefits they try to secure</image:caption
