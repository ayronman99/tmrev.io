        >That night Jaki, Remon, Papay, Niken and Anna headed to the top to make
        a short film about people's lives at the foot of the hill. In the course
        of the car driven by Jaki Cs the tires were flat. They stopped right in
        front of the Awful house, when they were going to replace the spare tire
        they lost their jack and finally they decided to enter the haunted house
        to find a loan from the jack. Because they did not know that the house
        they entered was haunted because there were pocong who like to disturb
        anyone who enters the house.</image:caption
