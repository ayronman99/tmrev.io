        >Seeking out a cure for his wife's serious illness, scientist Dr.
        Schroeder (McCormack) heads deep into a forbidden jungle in Guatemala,
        trapping thousands of killer wasps. Working with secret military
        backing, it is Schroeder's contention that the venom from the wasp's
        stingers can be of great medicinal benefit. But when they try to
        illegally smuggle the wasps into the US, the truck they are on crashes
        and the wasps are set free to wreak havoc, making a direct path to a
        small unsuspecting town. It is up to an American entomologist Daniel
        Lang and a nosey writer Sandra Kern to stop these deadly wasps - as they
        lay eggs in their victims to hatch thousands more wasps - before it's
        too late.</image:caption
