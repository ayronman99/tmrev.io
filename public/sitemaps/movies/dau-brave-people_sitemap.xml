        >It is 1953, Stalin has just died. It is a troubled and uncertain period
        for the whole of the Soviet Union, particularly for the state security
        services. In the Institute, a secret research facility, the scientists
        continue their theoretical and experimental work. Every night they
        strain their ears to listen for footsteps in the dark corridors: who
        have they come for this time? Who has reported on who? Having survived
        the fear and humiliation of an interrogation, the Head of the
        Theoretical Department, Andrei Losev, refuses to cooperate with the
        security services, only to face a new ordeal back in his own
        home.</image:caption
