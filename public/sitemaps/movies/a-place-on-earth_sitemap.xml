        >Antoine is a joyful but disenchanted photographer. His only true
        friend, Mateo, is 7 years old and the son of his neighbor, who is often
        absent. One day, he hears a piano sonata coming from the building across
        the courtyard. Mesmerized by the music, he becomes obsessed by Elena,
        the beautiful but mysterious pianist, and starts to photograph her at
        every opportunity. An intense relationship develops between fragile and
        idealistic Elena and Antoine, who is transformed by this
        encounter.</image:caption
