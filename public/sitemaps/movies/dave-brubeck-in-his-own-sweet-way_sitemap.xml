        >A chronological look at the life and career of jazz musician, composer,
        and performer Dave Brubeck (1920-2012 ), presented through contemporary
        interviews, archival footage of interviews and performances, and
        commentary by family, fellow musicians, and aficionados. Emphases
        include his mother's influence, his wife's invention of college tours,
        his skill as an accompanist, the great quartet (with Desmond, Morello,
        and Wright), his ability to find musical ideas everywhere, his
        orchestral compositions, his religious conversion, and his unflagging
        sweet nature.</image:caption
