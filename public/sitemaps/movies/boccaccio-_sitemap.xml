        >An anthology of four adult tales: a young couple tries to hide their
        marriage and the wifeâ€™s supposed pregnancy from their place of
        employment; a billboard photo of a scantily clad woman comes to life to
        torment the local censor; an aristocratic couple comes to terms with
        life and marriage after the domineering husband is caught visiting sex
        workers by the press; a lottery is held in which the prize is to spend
        the night with a beautiful woman. Inspired by Giovanni Boccaccio's
        novellas.</image:caption
