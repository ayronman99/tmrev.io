        >The Digital World is becoming so overpopulated that the super computer
        Yggdrasill who governs the Digital World can no longer handle it. Its
        solution is Project Ark: to wipe out most of inhabitants with the X
        Program. Yggdrasill chooses a very small percentage to be moved to a new
        Digital World and then proceeds to destroy the old one. Some Digimon who
        were not chosen survive anyway, and they move to the new world with a
        rare gift known as the X Antibody; this antibody changes their
        appearance and makes them more powerful, while at the same time making
        them immune to the X Program. No longer in control, Yggdrasill uses the
        Royal Knights to destroy these X-Digimon, who are outcasts in the new
        Digital World.</image:caption
