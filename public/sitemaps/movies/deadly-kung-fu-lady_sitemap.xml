        >When a mob boss feels threatened by the return of an old partner, he
        turns the town upside down to find a hit man who will help him keep his
        fortune intact. Meanwhile, the boss's beautiful daughter (and heir to
        his fortune) is called upon to organize the hit. All seems to be
        proceeding according to plan until she realizes that the hit man has
        designs on both the company and her. Stars Ko Hung.</image:caption
