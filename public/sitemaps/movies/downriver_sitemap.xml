        >James has served time for drowning a little boy when he was a child,
        although the body was never found in the river. A visit from his
        victim's mother upon parole sends him on a quest to find the truth. With
        little time and danger at every turn, James risks his freedom and his
        life to uncover the trail of sins that might give closure to the
        grieving mother.</image:caption
