        >When two ecologists break-in the laboratory of Dr. Belmont, they find a
        box with a subject and they decide to set the experiment free in the
        woods. During the transportation, the box opens and releases the mutant
        Tasmanian Devil that devours the two activists and escapes to the woods.
        Meanwhile, Dr. Belmont's son Hunter travels in a van with four friends
        to film a horror movie in the cemetery in the woods, while Belmont and
        his associate Dr. Christine Kollar seek their deadly experiment called
        Precious.</image:caption
