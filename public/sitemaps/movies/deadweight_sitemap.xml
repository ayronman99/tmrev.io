        >Ahti Ikonen is a reliable captain at the height of his career. He is in
        command of the 35,000-ton container vessel Brugge, which enters the port
        of Savannah/United States behind schedule. The loading of the ship
        commences in haste as the crew, led by the ambitious Romanian officer
        Katia, works by the piece so that they can sail in time. The Filipino
        seaman James has an accident during this semi- legal lashing procedure.
        Ahti has to face the consequences of his orders: In the port of
        Rotterdam/Netherlands unionized dockworkers exploit the incident and
        refuse to unload the ship. Standstill. The captain is caught between the
        frontlines. Ahti is keen to elucidate the accident, but the situation
        becomes more and more contradictoryâ€¦</image:caption
