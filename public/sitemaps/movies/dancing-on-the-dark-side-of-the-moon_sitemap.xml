        >Picture this if you will. A futuristic lighthouse floating through dark
        space. Aboard this lighthouse is a Spirit Guide and his two younglings
        Alexi and friend Micah. Three spiritual beings on an unusual journey.
        When the curious Alexi asks what his life will be like on earth the
        Spirit Guide is compelled to show him. He knows that dark forces are at
        hand and Alexi may indeed never be born at all. The Guide reluctantly
        shows him special moments in time where we find Alexi's family in deep
        turmoil where dark secrets abound.</image:caption
