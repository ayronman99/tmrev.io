        >Aki and Naoko are childhood friends who are drifting apart as adults.
        Immersed in her family life, Naoko now has a husband and daughter; Aki,
        on the other hand, remains single and is on leave from work due to a
        personal crisis. The plot might sound familiar but it has never been
        told like this. The director Kusano Natsuka stages the interactions
        through an actors’ table-read and, as the lines are repeated, the scenes
        gradually develop into on-location conversations. Moreover, she
        repositions the dramatic peak of the story to the beginning: Aki has
        murdered Naoko’s daughter.</image:caption
