        >Since his wife's death, Arthur, a peculiar and severe surgeon,
        cloisters his teen daughter Lucille inside a strange mansion. Desperate,
        Lucille tries to commit suicide and ends up with her face completely
        burned and bandaged. Arthur, with the assistance of his aunt, prepares a
        weird skin graft in order to give back Lucille a face, a face that
        resembles his beloved and deceased wife. To take care of her, the father
        then hires Joan, an attractive nurse with a somber past. Lucille and
        Joan start a forbidden and passionate love affair.</image:caption
