        >Documentary about jazz great Chet Baker that intercuts footage from the
        1950s, when he was part of West Coast Cool, and from his last years. We
        see the young Baker, he of the beautiful face, in California and in
        Italy, where he appeared in at least one movie and at least one jail
        cell (for drug possession). And, we see the aged Baker, detached,
        indifferent, his face a ruin. Includes interviews with his children and
        ex-wife, women companions, and musicians.</image:caption
