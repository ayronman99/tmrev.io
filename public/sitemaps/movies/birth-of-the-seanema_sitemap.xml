        >Those images flow from track to crack the sea. This memory is lost. Or
        is the memory, which invented new. They said to each other Buzz to give
        daytime and night vision can listen. They are a girl who becomes a kite.
        And the men who tear the island on the glass. The girl, who later became
        Mangpor. Become lost memories become memories fabricated on. In a city
        that became birds. Stoles back into the infinite ocean. The mold may not
        recognize the language. Pictures without a source A set of memories that
        still existed in the dim fuzzy. If you are in the clear. The image will
        leave forever gone.</image:caption
