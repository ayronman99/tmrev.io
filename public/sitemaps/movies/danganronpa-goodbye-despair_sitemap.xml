        >Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair takes place shortly after the events of
        Trigger Happy Havoc and Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair
        Girls. The game is from Hajime Hinata's point of view as he starts his
        first year at Hope's Peak Academy. As he walks into the school building,
        he is overcome with fatigue; when he recovers, he finds himself in front
        of a door. He has a strong urge to open it, and once he does, he finds
        himself in a classroom full of his new classmates.</image:caption
