        >12 year-Â­old Adama lives in a remote village in West Africa, sheltered
        by the Cliffs. Out, beyond, lies "the land of breaths", the kingdom of
        wicked spirits hungry for war. When Samba, his elder brother, suddenly
        vanishes from the village, Adama decides to set off in search of him.
        Accompanied first by Abdou, a tragically lucid griot, then by Maximin, a
        street urchin who is his own negative twin, he crosses a Europe in the
        grip of war. We're in 1914. Borne by the energy of desperation and the
        poetry of childhood, Adama travels to the hell of the frontline in order
        to free his brother. Ultimately, Adama's love for his brother will open
        an unexpected way to his initiatory journey.</image:caption
