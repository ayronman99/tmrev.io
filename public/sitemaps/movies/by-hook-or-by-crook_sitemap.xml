        >By Hook or by Crook chronicles the tale of two unlikely friends who
        commit petty crimes as they search for a path to understanding
        themselves and the outside world. Silas Howard plays Shy (a transgender
        man), who leaves his small town after the death of his father, and heads
        to the big city to live a life of crime. Along the way, he encounters
        Valentine, a quirky adoptee, in search of his birth mother. An immediate
        kinship is sparked between these men and they become partners in crime.
        Suffering money troubles, emotional problems, and physical
        confrontations, the duo face their issues head on and learn to trust
        each other and support each other in pursuit of their
        goals.</image:caption
