        >According to the Tao peopleâ€™s traditional beliefs, illness was a sign
        of supernatural possession by evil spirits. Many patients thus became
        isolated, unable to receive any medical care. A native of the Orchid
        Island (Lanyu) where she worked as a nurse, the filmmaker initiated a
        program in 1997, recruiting some 40 volunteers to visit and care for
        homebound elderly patients against considerable social pressure. This
        documentary captures the powerful dilemma when traditional values clash
        with compassion.</image:caption
