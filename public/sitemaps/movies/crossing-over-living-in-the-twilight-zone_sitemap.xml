        >This in-depth documentary chronicles the development and production of
        Jordan Peele's modern take on the classic anthology series. Fans will
        get an inside look at the process of finding the right creative approach
        to bring back one of television's most iconic and influential
        storytelling platforms. Executive producers Simon Kinberg, Jordan Peele,
        Wyn Rosenfeld, Audrey Chon, and Glen Morgan shed light on the different
        ideas and concepts explored during the early days of development as well
        as the creative choices that helped lay the foundation for the new
        series - from conceptualizing The Twilight Zone as an actual dimension
        parallel to our own reality to incorporating Rod Serling into the new
        show's central premise and how all these creative milestones unraveled
        during the development of Season One.</image:caption
