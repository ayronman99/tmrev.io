        >Under the most complicated circumstances, when the world seems
        impossibly dark, a woman takes her life into her own hands. She risks
        everything to save her politically imprisoned husband - and sets herself
        free. The Birmingham Opera Company's production set in an enormous
        circus tent and mixing professional and amateur performers powerfully
        explores what oppression means today. The striking image of over 200
        local people participating in their own imprisonments and experiencing
        freedom will stay with you for a long time to come.</image:caption
