        >During World War II, earnest young Russian soldier Alyosha Skvortsov is
        rewarded with a short leave of absence for performing a heroic deed on
        the battlefield. Feeling homesick, he decides to visit his mother. Due
        to his kindhearted nature, however, Alyosha is repeatedly sidetracked by
        his efforts to help those he encounters, including a lovely girl named
        Shura. In his tour of a country devastated by war, he struggles to keep
        hope alive.</image:caption
