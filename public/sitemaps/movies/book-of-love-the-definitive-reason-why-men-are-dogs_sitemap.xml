        >Book of Love delivers humor along with the mysteries of unrequited love
        and relationships gone bad. The film's story line focuses on three men
        living, dating and loving in Los Angeles in the 90's. They struggle with
        heartbreak and insecurity as a result of failed relationships. The three
        characters’ stories unfold through sessions with their therapist –
        sessions that are often as comedic as they are
        insightful.</image:caption
