        >Eddy does what he has to do to give his family what they want. For the
        last 25 years, he has secretly moonlighted as a "standover" man, purely
        to provide his aspirational wife with her dream house and a privileged
        upbringing for his only daughter. Eddy finds it hard to express how he
        feels, especially now that his "little girl" is engaged and will soon be
        leaving the family home. Chantelle believes her emotionally blocked
        father has only two feelings "angry" and "very angry" and feels her
        father just doesn't understand her. Eddy is perplexed: "What's to
        understand?" Herein lies the problem. Over eager to get on the same
        wavelength as his daughter and recapture the closeness they once had,
        Eddy starts reading Chantelle's diary. In the process, more secrets than
        anyone was prepared for, begin to surface with devastating yet hilarious
        results. Eddy rides the storm and once the dust settles, all is well...
        for now.</image:caption
