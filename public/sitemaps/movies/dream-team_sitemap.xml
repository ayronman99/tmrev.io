        >Soccer coach Byrd is persuaded by teacher Noo Lek to help coach ten of
        the school's kindergarteners students for a tug-of-war tournament being
        staged as part of the 18th National Kindergarten Sports Competition.
        Problems arise upon learning the rules clearly state that only 9 players
        are allowed on each tug of war team. Thus the 10-kid "Dream Team" must
        bench one member during the competition. Coach Byrd is forced to deal
        with a bunch of interfering parents who want to make sure their kid is
        featured on the school team.</image:caption
