        >This is a film about the September 11, 1973 military coup in Chile,
        from the point of view of Chileans who were born and grew up after this
        traumatic event. Based on improvisations and collective creation work,
        groups of pre-schoolers, adolescents, and university students from
        different social, cultural, and political origins, recreate history
        through mise-en-scenes that come from their own imaginations. The film
        articulates this creative vortex in a multiple-narrative flowing
        cinematic mosaic that gives an account of contemporary Chile by reliving
        its past.</image:caption
