        >Colloquially-told story of a few days in the life of Marieta, who's
        saving money for the last operation in her change from man to woman. She
        works as a prostitute in Madrid and longs for a legitimate job. Whenever
        she builds up her savings, her housemate and best friend Tomás finds
        ways to spend, lose, or cost her those funds. She meets Raúl, whom she
        likes and who likes her; the trouble is he also likes that part of her
        she wants removed. If that's not enough, she also has narcolepsy, and
        when she conks out, she dreams of musical-theater numbers in which she's
        the singing and dancing star. Are these dreams always going to be 20
        centimeters out of reach?</image:caption
