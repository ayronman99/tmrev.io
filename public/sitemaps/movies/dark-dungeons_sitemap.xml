        >College freshmen Debbie and Marcie are excited to start their new lives
        at a Pacific Northwest university but after being invited to a Zeta
        Omega Epsilon party the two suddenly find themselves in the strange and
        occult world of Role Playing Games. The duo are soon hooked on the
        highly addictive experience that is RPGing and the game quickly becomes
        a habit that consumes their lives. After Debbie’s intense pagan training
        through the RPGs lead her to accept an invitation to join a witches’
        coven, her grades begin to plummet and she is in danger of flunking out
        of college. She calls on darker and deeper magical forces to use a “mind
        bondage” spell on her professor. Meanwhile, Marcie foolishly reads from
        the Necronomicon and summons Cthulhu.</image:caption
