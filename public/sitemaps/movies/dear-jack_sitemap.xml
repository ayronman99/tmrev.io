        >Using The DV camera originally enlisted to capture the making of his
        album, Andrew shot everything before and after the crucial day in May of
        2005 when he both finished his record and was diagnosed with cancer.
        Dear Jack opens on the day of his diagnosis and continues on through the
        life-changing and deeply personal events that followed. The film also
        includes flashes back to Andrew's childhood and the making of the first
        Jack's Mannequin album, as well as rare live footage and the chronicling
        of his relationships with two very important people in his life, his
        sister and her best friend.</image:caption
