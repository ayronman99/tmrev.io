        >Episodic in nature, Curious About Existence reacts ultimately against
        an uninspired but prevailing acceptance of moral terms. It begins with a
        song of worship, an ode to the looming nastiness of our organic
        existence. A celebration of disorder and entropy, the opening song seems
        borne of a curiosity about the possibilities of joy and freedom. In a
        more lighthearted segment, a squirrel and beaver converse about how
        everybody feels bad a lot of the time, which is compounded by the stupid
        things they do as a result. By enjoying the spectacle of the river
        creaturesâ€™ conversation, we are guided through another chapter of
        anxiety about shame with the opportunity for impunity.</image:caption
