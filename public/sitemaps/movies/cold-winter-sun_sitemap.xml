        >Rich kid Adrian is released form the psychiatric institution where he
        has lived since he was a child and goes to live in the house he's been
        given by his father, who he's not seen for years. On the other opposite
        end of the city, sleepy-eyed Gonzalo, the son of aging hooker Raquel,
        finds himself desperately short on cash. Attempting to burgle Adrian's
        house, Gonzalo is caught red-handed by Adrian who promises not to tell
        the cops if Gonzalo will acquire a pistol for him. Their meeting is the
        start of something that neither of them could have ever
        imagined.</image:caption
