        >A-Tai (Alan Ko) narrates that he is the son of Uncle Da (Chen Po-cheng)
        and Aunt Da (Samantha Ko), who run a troupe in Taichung. Uncle Da's
        troupe does traditional performance in front of religious processions.
        The religion requires performers to "initiate the faces and pose as
        gods"â€”to put on a special face painting, or to put on a heavy body
        puppet costume, both of these represent gods' persona. The performance
        demands training of martial art, acrobatics and endurance, and the
        performers are negatively associated with gangsters by the society.
        Uncle Da has been competing with Wu-cheng (Liao Jun), who studied with
        Uncle Da under the same master. A-Tai grew estranged with his father and
        the troupe, and went to Taipei to study Rock music, until a mysterious
        old man in blue coat bids him home.</image:caption
