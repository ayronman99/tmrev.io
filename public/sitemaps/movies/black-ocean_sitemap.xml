        >Though its aftertitles detailing the history of French nuke experiments
        suggest otherwise, writer/director Marion Hänsel’s Black Ocean is not a
        political treatise or a history lesson, instead taking advantage of the
        remote, isolated environments in which the experimentation took place –
        as well as the monumental imagery of the act itself – in order to
        communicate a more universal story about the power of awe. Ocean
        principally follows three young sailors on a French naval vessel in
        1972, who are on course for an unknown destination in order to help
        carry out the bomb tests they’ve yet to personally witness. The film is
        essentially divided into two parts: before and after the
        blast.</image:caption
