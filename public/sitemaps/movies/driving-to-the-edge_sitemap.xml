        >Between 2007 and 2011, 725 Quebecers aged 16 to 24 were killed in car
        accidents. Excessive speed and alcohol were involved in half of these
        deaths. To try to understand what is going on in these young drivers'
        heads when they get behind the wheel, host and documentary filmmaker
        Paul Arcand met with some of them. On one hand, he gives a voice to
        these young people who love driving fast. On the other hand, he provides
        a forum for two accident victims who were injured both physically and
        psychologically. Finally, the director meets the mother of little Bianca
        Leduc, who was killed by a drunk driver while she was in the care of her
        babysitter, and the parents of Michael Borduas, 23, who is severely
        disabled from an accident.</image:caption
