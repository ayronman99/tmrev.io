        >Bruno is doing time in prison for a bank robbery. On Christmas day he
        receives a letter from his son, which makes him want to break out of
        prison immediately. His escape plan and his accomplice are in place, but
        a “Christmas miracle” turns everything upside down. A search for the
        escaped prisoner begins. To stay hidden he is suddenly forced to not
        only dress in a Santa Claus costume, but also spend Christmas Eve with a
        police officer and his family in their holiday cabin. While Bruno is
        only thinking about getting away, the police officer’s children only
        want Santa to help save their family which is on the edge of breaking
        apart. Will Bruno be able to save this family or will he be captured
        before getting where he needs to be?</image:caption
