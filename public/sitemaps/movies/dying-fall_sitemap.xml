        >Dying Fall tells the story of Ben, the estranged son of a well-to-do
        Boston family who has moved north to Halifax, Nova Scotia, to pursue his
        studies as a graduate student in music. Ben is stuck in an existential
        drift until he discovers that he has a potentially fatal aneurysm in his
        brain. This spurs him to seek out the one experience that he had until
        this point considered unimportant - trying to find a real connection
        with a woman, before it's too late.</image:caption
