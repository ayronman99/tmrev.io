        From the moment the very first jumbo jet took off in 1969, it has been
        the aircraft against which all others are judged. But its 45-year
        journey has been anything but smooth. This is the definitive story of
        the Boeing 747, from its milestones and triumphs to its turning points
        and disasters. Witness its history through rare archival footage and
        tales from pilots, engineers, designers, and passengers who were there
        when it all began.</image:caption
