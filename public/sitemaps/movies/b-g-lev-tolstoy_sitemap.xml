        >The director tells the story of Boris Grebenshchikov through the image
        of Leo Tolstoy. According to Viktor Tikhomirov, both heroes are similar
        "in their delusions and achievements". The film has a lot of chronicles
        and, of course, Grebenshchikov's songs sound, and George Gunitsky
        described the tape after its premiere at Pushkinskaya 10: "A completely
        untethered and insanely surreal film in a good way. And it is gratifying
        that all this postmodern film improvisation is involved on a cool
        aquarium basis. We need to look at the picture again once or twice, get
        a better understanding of it. And savor it. A very worthy
        work."</image:caption
