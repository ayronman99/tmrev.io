        >At a Bangkok 'Asian Bhai Meet' the Godfather meets with several
        gangsters, reviews the reduction in revenue, and decides to induct fresh
        blood. While Fursat Lala decides to hand-over this task to his son, Zac;
        Mungi Lal, a bachelor, has no heir, save for an long-estranged maternal
        nephew, Kamal, and is asked to find him and include him in this gang
        within 30 days. Mungi and his associate, Jignesh, head out to Mumbai in
        an effort to locate his estranged sister, Angoori, and her son - in vain
        - as there is no trace of the duo. He recruits the services of Private
        Detective Johnny English and instructs him to locate Kamal. Johnny does
        locate him and takes him to meet with Mungi - a move that will result in
        nothing but hilarious chaos when Mungi tells him that he has already
        located Kamal. Things get even more confusing after a woman shows up -
        also claiming to be Kamal!!</image:caption
