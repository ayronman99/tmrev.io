        >Brian Jones, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Jim Morrison all died at
        the age of 27 between 1969 and 1971. At the time, the coincidence gave
        rise to some comment, but it was not until the death of Kurt Cobain,
        about two and a half decades later, that the idea of a "27 Club" began
        to catch on in public perception, reignited with the death of Amy
        Winehouse in 2011. Through interviews with people who knew them, such as
        music stars, critics, medical experts and unseen footage, the lives,
        music, and artistry of those who died at 27 are investigated with a bid
        to find answers.</image:caption
