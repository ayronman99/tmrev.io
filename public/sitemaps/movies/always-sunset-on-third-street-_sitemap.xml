        >Would-be writer Ryunosuke Chagawa is still living across the street
        from Norifumi Suzuki and his auto repair shop, though now he shares his
        home with Junnosuke, an orphan he's taken under his wing at the urging
        of pretty Hiroi, who continues to manage a nearby tavern. Chagawa dreams
        of publishing a successful novel and settling down with Hiroi and
        Junnosuke, but his day job running the candy store keeps him busy, and
        Hiroi mistakes his tight schedule for a lack of interest in her. Hiroi
        has also embarked on a secret career as a burlesque dancer, which isn't
        doing much to improve her opinion of men. At the Suzuki household,
        seven-year-old Ippei isn't happy to be sharing the house with a guest,
        his distant cousin Mika who is the same age but far more demanding.
        Mutsuko, the apprentice female auto mechanic, is still staying with the
        Suzukis, and she's becomes the object of the affections of Takeo, a
        downbeat young man who is studying cooking.</image:caption
