        >The four friends Musti (Reza Brojerdi), Hannah (Lea van Acken), Yannick
        (Jerry Hoffmann) and Tom (Lucas Reiber) could not be more different. But
        they have one thing in common: They are all pretty nerdy misfits who
        only just survived school thanks to their mutual support. For
        graduation, they want to prove it to everyone and promise nothing less
        than the craziest party of the year. However, the closer the legendary
        party gets, the more the friends realize that there seems to be
        something between them. Be it unspoken feelings, hurt pride or fear of
        the future. When the big day of the party finally dawned, the four of
        them were no longer just about celebrating, but about saving what is
        most important to them: their friendship!</image:caption
