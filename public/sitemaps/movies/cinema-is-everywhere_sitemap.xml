        >A documentary feature film that ties four narratives - from China,
        India, Scotland, and Tunisia - together with countless insights from
        venerable filmmakers and ordinary moviegoers. An aspiring actress in
        Mumbai battles to break into Bollywood; two friends in Scotland take a
        mobile film festival across the highlands; a young crew in Hong Kong
        embarks on the shooting of its first film; a Tunisian director anxiously
        anticipates the premiere of his controversial film at a major festival.
        These stories are woven together with scenes from video stores,
        projection booths, studios, cinemas, and slums into a vivid meditation
        on the power of cinema to shape our world.</image:caption
