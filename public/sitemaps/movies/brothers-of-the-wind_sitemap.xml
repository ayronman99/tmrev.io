        >The way of the eagle is to raise two chicks. The stronger is destined
        always to throw the weaker from the nest. Man also has his ways, often
        to hurt those closest to him. Lukas suffers at the hands of a father who
        has withdrawn since the loss of his wife. Killed whilst rescuing the
        infant Lukas, the boy now carries the burden of her death. Our eagleâ€™s
        story begins in the nest. The first-born chick pushes his weaker brother
        to a certain death on the forest floor. But fate intervenes and the
        chick is found by Lukas. Naming him Abel, Lukas cares for the creature
        in secret, finding a love and companionship denied to him at home. But
        when the day comes to release Abel back into the wild, will Lukas find
        his own release into a new life?</image:caption
