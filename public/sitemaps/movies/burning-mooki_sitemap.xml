        >When Mooky is fifteen, his beloved father dies a sudden death, and his
        place is taken by Yanek - an impulsive, rough, yet generous man who is
        regarded as a controversial figure due to his doings in the Holocaust in
        the Zonder Commando. He brutally invades Mooky's life and turns it
        upside-down. During Mookys teenage years, which are affected by his
        seductive mother Tinka, he deals with unfulfilled love for one girl and
        a dominated relationship with another. One day Mooky returns to his
        mother's home, deranged, and does something from which there is no
        turning back. Twenty years later, Mooky must decide whether to attend
        his mother's funeral and re-open his wounds of the past.</image:caption
