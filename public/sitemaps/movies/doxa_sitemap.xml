        >Sanna has broken up with her boyfriend Jon. Because her father is in
        the hospital, she moved into her father's apartment. In his dresser
        drawer, she finds clipped obituaries of his colleagues, who all seem to
        have died prematurely. Sanna crosses one border after another,
        approaching a total collapse of her obsession with truth. In the end,
        she takes the law into her own hands.</image:caption
