        >In this movie, that takes place three months after MaloMyotismon's
        defeat, the DigiDestined go up against Diaboromon again. Tai and Matt
        head back to the Internet to deal with him with Omnimon, while the
        younger Chosen Children go to deal with the rampage of a swarm of
        Kuramon (Diaboromon's Fresh form). With the help of Angemon and
        Angewomon (with T.K. and Kari), Omnimon was able to destroy Diaboromon
        again, but it turned out to be a trap, as his destruction allowed many
        more Kuramon to go to the Real World. Things go out of control when the
        Kuramon in the Real World merge to create a Mega level called
        Armageddemon, an alternate Mega in Diaboromon's evolutionary line. It is
        so powerful that neither Omnimon nor Imperialdramon were able to defeat
        it on their own.</image:caption
