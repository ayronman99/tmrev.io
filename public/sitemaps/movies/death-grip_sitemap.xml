        >In an effort to set his life straight, Kenny Zemacus checks his
        autistic brother Mark out of the care home where he's spent the past
        fifteen years since their mother's death. When Kenny reluctantly brings
        Mark on a last minute museum catering gig, Mark unwittingly entangles
        them in a dangerous heist involving the museum's showpiece -- the Silver
        Coin of Judas -- and a murderous satanic cult known as The Knights of
        Judas. The two brothers are propelled into the cult's demonic world
        where they must fight for their lives and face the depths of their own
        dark past.</image:caption
