        >The children of Mars are in a funk, and nothing on the red planet seems
        to be able to cheer them up. Martian King Kimar comes up with the only
        reasonable solution: kidnap Santa Claus from Earth's North Pole and
        bring him to their planet to make toys for their joyless, listless
        little green kids. Meanwhile, two Earth children get wise to the plan
        and are abducted along with Santa to prevent them from talking to the
        authorities. Luckily for them, Dropo, the Jerry Lewis of the fourth
        planet from the sun, is there to help them. The fiendish plot doesn't go
        according to plan, and there's plenty of intrigue, double-crossing,
        mistaken identity and stock footage for kids of all ages and planets to
        enjoy. Poorly conceived, sloppily made, and unfailingly bizarre, "Santa
        Claus Conquers the Martians" is the ultimate Christmas movie-riffing
        classic (as fans of MST3K know) which is why Cinematic Titanic chose to
        revisit, re-riff, and release this holiday hamfest with all new jokes.
