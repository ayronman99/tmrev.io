        >Set in Isaan, this is the story of a mother who struggles to lead her
        needy family through seemingly endless hardships and pressures. To help
        the family survive, the father endures greedy capitalists who
        heartlessly take advantage of him and his family, forcing him to slave
        at the harvest of an infertile field. That is until he loses both his
        arms. Then all the burdens fall on the mother: bread-winning, taking
        care of her crippled husband and raising the kids, all amid external
        pressures from drought to vile businessmen.</image:caption
