        >Itâ€™s now 40 years since the end of the Cod Wars between Britain and
        Iceland. During the 1950s and 60s, Britain consumed 430,000 tons of cod
        each year, but as the stocks started to diminish the livelihoods of
        fishing communities in both countries were at stake. Iceland took steps
        to protect their fishing industry - the mainstay of their economy -
        resulting in the three so-called Cod Wars. This was a David and Goliath
        struggle, where the small fleet of Icelandic gunboats were pitted
        against the British trawlers and the Royal Navy in the North Atlantic.
        This Icelandic film, made in 2001, tells the story from both sides and
        reflects on the impact of the Cod Wars in Grimsby and
        Hull.</image:caption
