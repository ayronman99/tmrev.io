        >Alan Turing is the genius British mathematician who was instrumental in
        breaking the German naval Enigma Code during World War II, arguably
        saving millions of lives. Turing's achievements went unrecognised during
        his lifetime. Instead he ended up being treated as a common criminal,
        for being homosexual at a time when homosexual acts were a crime. In
        1952, he was convicted of 'gross indecency' with another man and was
        forced to undergo so-called 'organo-therapy' - chemical castration. Two
        years later, he killed himself with cyanide, aged just 41. Alan Turing
        was driven to a terrible despair and early death by the nation he'd done
        so much to save.</image:caption
