        >Mia Moolman works for a Sandton-based event coordination company that
        has been commissioned by the department of Trade and Industry to create
        an event celebrating the most successful ad campaigns in South African
        history. The gala event will happen at Emperors Palace, and the CEO of
        the company, Theodore, has asked his employees to pitch ideas for the
        show and whoever comes up with the best idea will be awarded a promotion
        and a special bonus. Mia comes up with the idea to make the three guys
        from the old Castrol commercials, Boet, Swaer and Mogae, part of the
        show. Her boss eventually agrees to this, but Mia must go and find them
        in the Kalahari and bring them to Emperors Palace in time for the big
        gala event. Will she get them to the big show in time?</image:caption
