        >In "7 Sins" Inčiūraitė asks seven sportswomen living in seven different
        Lithuanian cities to speak about their opinions on the seven deadly sins
        – sloth, pride, wrath, gluttony, lust, envy, and greed – from a
        contemporary perspective. The sportswomen chosen for this film compete
        in one-on-one sports, a metaphorical duality which expresses the two
        sides of the women’s identity – the dark and the light. This film is a
        visualisation of human duality, of the internal personal struggle,
        constant in both art and life. The documentary paints a portrait of each
        woman as a contemporary heroine fighting against adversity while at the
        same time tenaciously working towards their dreams and personal
        legends.</image:caption
