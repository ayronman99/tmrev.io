        >Magnus once had a girlfriend and a kid. But his girlfriend now has
        somebody new. And so now Magnus has his classic car, and a bar.
        Everything about Magnus’ manner makes him a hipster – par excellence. He
        has a couple of close friends, all cut from the same cloth. But then one
        night his car is stolen and Magnus falls into a kind of cultivated
        despair.</image:caption
