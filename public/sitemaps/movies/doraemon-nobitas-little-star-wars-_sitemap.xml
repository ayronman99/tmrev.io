        >One day during summer vacation, a palm-sized alien named Papi appears
        from a small rocket that Nobita picks up. He is the president of Pirika,
        a small planet in outer space, and has come to Earth to escape the
        rebels. Doraemon and his friends are puzzled by Papi’s small size, but
        as they play together using the secret tool “Small Light”, they
        gradually become friends. However, a whale-shaped space battleship comes
        to earth and attacks Doraemon, Nobita and the others in order to capture
        Papi. Feeling responsible for getting everyone involved, Papi tries to
        stand up to the rebels. Doraemon and his friends leave for the planet
        Pirika to protect their dear friend and his home.</image:caption
