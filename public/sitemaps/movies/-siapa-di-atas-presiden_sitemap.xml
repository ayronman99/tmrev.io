        >Ricky Bagaskoro (Rizky Nazar), high school student, is in a dilemma: to
        pursue his dream of becoming teachers for displaced children or to
        follow the wishes of his father, Bagas Notolegowo (Ray Sahetapy), to
        continue his study to the highest level. Bagas hopes Ricky will follow
        in his footsteps of being a politician. Bagas is struggling to become
        president of Indonesia 2014-2019 to replace President Jusuf Syahrir
        (Deddy Sutomo). Preoccupations make his relationship with Ricky tenuous.
        Ricky does not agree with his father's steps. Ningrum (Donna Harun), a
        faithful wife and mother, always tries to unify them. The competition to
        the presidency between Bagas Notolegowo, Faisal Abdul Hamid (Rudy Salam)
        and Syamsul Triadi (Akri Patrio) is very tight. Bagas makes a careless
        step. One simple decision makes all his dreams shattered
        .</image:caption
