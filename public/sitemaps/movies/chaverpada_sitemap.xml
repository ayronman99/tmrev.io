        >Chaverpada tells the story of a group of engineering college students
        Ameer (Manikuttan), Abhimanyu (Arun), Vivek (Vivek) and Tony (Tony) who
        have developed a means of their own to voice their protests against the
        ills that have gripped today's society. The testing phase of a software
        that they have developed causes unexpected jams in the traffic signals
        as well as the wireless system of the city. The youngsters realize that
        they are in trouble when the cops find out more about the incident.
        Police moved to the college to arrest them. However, they are kidnapped
        by the terrorists before the cops could lay their hands on them. Visal
        Sabhapathi (Bala), the leader of the N. S. G. Commando wing, is soon
        called in to look into the case and rescue the students.</image:caption
