        regularly turned down at auditions. While Kathi doesn't know how to get
        her life on track, her mother Chris is a successful psychoanalyst. Chris
        doesn't take her daughter's career choices seriously, and constantly
        tries to give her good advice on everything. One day, Kathi's father
        suddenly appears after 15 years of absence and wants to reunite the
        family. Confronted with the past, Kathi gets the unexpected chance to
        address the ongoing conflict with her mother and to set new goals for
        her future.</image:caption
