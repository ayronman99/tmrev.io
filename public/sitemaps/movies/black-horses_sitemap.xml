        >Black Horses is a film about the destiny of Serbian people who are
        forced to endure the "rule from the North" against their will. The
        empress Maria Theresia has designated their region of Banat to be the
        dungeon for insubordinate citizens of the Austro-Hungarian empire.
        Fortunately, World War One has interfered and ended the rule of the
        Austrain emperors, but many wounds have remained, wounds that bore spite
        and on the basis of which the people began their struggle to find their
        identity, to gain their freedom and land and a better life. That kind of
        surroundings, full of those ready to exploit others and retort to
        violence, where a man is torn between honesty and fraud, was my
        inspiration to make a modern film focused on love "the thing a man can
        suffer for; a thing you can give your heart to; and a thing that can
        make your heart stop".</image:caption
