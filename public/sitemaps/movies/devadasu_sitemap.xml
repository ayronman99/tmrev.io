        >Devadas (Ram) is the typical poor student, while Bhanumati (Ileana) is
        a rich NRI girl whose father is the senator of New York. They fall in
        love when the girl comes to India to learn classical Carnatic music.
        Coming to know about their love, Bhanuâ€™s father Katamraju (Sayaji
        Shinde) hatches a plan to separate them. He promises to get them married
        but he takes her daughter, and her grand mother back to the USA. The
        rest of the story is how the street-smart lover boy makes it to the USA
        and succeeds in attaining his girl.</image:caption
