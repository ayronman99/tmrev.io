        >This outstanding concert DVD was originally recorded in 1985. The
        master tapes were thought to have been lost in a fire, but were
        discovered in 2000, along with the original "surround sound" master.
        Special DVD features include 4.0 Channel Dolby Digital and DTS Digital
        Surround tracks, solos of selected performers, track selection menu,
        additional commentary by Marie & Cathy Rich, Dave Weckl and Gary Reber.
        Also included are interview segments, behind-the-scenes footage of Buddy
        and rare photos from the Rich family archives.</image:caption
