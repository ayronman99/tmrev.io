        >A Hero... in Rome is a road movie about a man who dares to make his
        dream to reality. He goes to Rome to see his idol in the world of opera.
        Instead of joy, he falls victim to a theft that changes and upsets
        everything in his life. A series of tragicomic situations follow. The
        bittersweet experience of a journey. Loneliness and the quest. Nostalgia
        for tender innocence. An extreme event mars his return to Greece and so
        he becomes the hero of the day for the media. But deep inside his soul,
        what was this trip for him?</image:caption
