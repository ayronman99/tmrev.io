        >In Westland, New York, a murderer is indiscriminately killing peopleâ€¦ A
        girl witnesses one of these murders, and the knife is turned on the
        helpless girl shaking with fear. Meg returns to this town with Joe to
        celebrate the "birthday" of Shirley, who used to live with Meg. Orphans,
        they had decided that the day they first met would be her birthday. In
        the past, Meg had taken care of three little children, including
        Shirley, just before meeting Joe. The children were then adopted by a
        police officer, Sam. He possessed a strong sense of justice and they are
        supposedly living happily together now. Meg and Joe happen to help a
        person and receive a reward. They buy a present for Shirley with the
        reward money and go to meet Sam. However, they notice him acting
        strangely. Upon questioning him, he explains that Shirley was assaulted
        by a murderer and seriously injured. Joe says to the grieving and angry
        Meg, "Let's exact revenge on the murderer for Shirley."</image:caption
