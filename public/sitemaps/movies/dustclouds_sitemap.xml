        >"Dustclouds" is an epic fever-dream, chronicling a long night's journey
        into day. As his wedding carriage rides beneath a starlit night, Getz
        vows to enjoy the fruits of his labor. Having worked his whole life, he
        has finally married. Yet as he lies in his bride's embrace, Getz already
        starts to question his happiness. Deep within, he yearns for "the
        perfect," which puts strain on his marriage. As the night progresses,
        inner turmoil unravels the fabric of Getz's being. Years begin to pass
        like seconds. Time, identity and purpose become unstuck. And a great
        sadness is borne into his life. Getz longs for answers, but is terrified
        by what he could lose in his search for truth? What follows is a quest
        deep into his heart of darkness.</image:caption
