        >Bill, an ex-boxer, is a failure in life but has no idea what to do
        about it -- until he meets local dodgy businessman Hamid
        'Anything-U-Need' Choudhury. Hamid convinces Bill that there is serious
        money to be made in man vs animal boxing bouts. Bill cashes in his life
        savings to buy two meters of living, breathing, armor-plated giant
        mutant mantis shrimp with a smashing right hook, and sets off for London
        to fulfill his dreams. Along for the ride are his best friend Steve,
        ex-condom-factory employee and amateur boxer, Steve's highly-strung
        girlfriend Shaz, and a misunderstood, club-clawed crustacean who is not
        as stupid as it seems...</image:caption
