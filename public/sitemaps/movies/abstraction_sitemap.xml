        >Tommy and Gary are criminals engaging in grand thefts in order to make
        ends meet. They are opportunists and have no fear. After a routine
        robbery goes awry, the friends are forced to put their criminal activity
        behind them. As Tommy's relationship flourishes with his new girlfriend
        Scarlet, his economic hardships become obvious. Scarlet soon proposes a
        notion that will make all their money troubles vanish - the heist of a
        half a million dollar painting. With just a short window of opportunity,
        Tommy and Gary design an ambitious plan, one that will ultimately
        determine their fate.</image:caption
