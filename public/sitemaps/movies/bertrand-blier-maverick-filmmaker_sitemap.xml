        Everyone in France knows the films of Bertrand Blier. From "Les
        Valseuses" (Getting it Up) to "Merci La Vie" (Thank You, Life), his work
        has become part of French cultural heritage. Every French adult can
        recall a scene or a line of dialogue from one of his films. But what
        about the man himself? Who exactly is behind the singular, sometimes
        unsettling work, which is often intentionally truculent or downright
        provocative?</image:caption
