        >When Slavko's old friend Djulaga dies, Slavko feels obliged to go to
        the funeral. But in his hometown of Mostar, in Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina,
        this simple social obligation has the potential to get him into all
        kinds of trouble: with his neighbors or even with local political
        bigwigs. Yet if he does not go, his wife will think he's a coward, the
        grieving family will never forgive him - and he might have trouble
        forgiving himself. This is a compelling tale of everyday life in a
        fractured society, and a world where paranoia, comedy and drama
        co-exist. It is also an astute psychological portrait of a man who is
        forced to cross the invisible line that divides two communities. Above
        all, it is the story of a man who lost everything that defined him, when
        his country disintegrated.</image:caption
