        >Having just been fired and dumped by his wife, life couldn't possibly
        be worse for independent artist Gordon Hauge (Mark Redfield)—until he
        wrecks his car and finds himself in purgatory, that is. Once there, he
        is attacked by fanatic Shadowmen and legions of Ragmen—souls being
        enslaved and bent to some dark purpose. Gordon is rescued by an
        eccentric band of freedom fighters, people from different times of
        history who lost their lives in noble sacrifice. They recruit the
        reluctant and befuddled Gordon and set off on a wild adventure through
        the surreal landscapes of purgatory to battle the Despiser—an evil being
        who now reigns in this seemingly God-abandoned halfway house north of
        hell and south of heaven.</image:caption
