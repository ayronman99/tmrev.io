        >Summer in L.A., it's hot. Homeland Security has set the threat level at
        red; they're searching for several Arabs alleged to be terrorists.
        Mustafa, an Egyptian immigrant who runs a falafel shop, comes to the
        FBI's attention; they investigate him. He has other problems: his young
        teen son no longer wants to be a Muslim; his sister, a nurse, objects to
        Mustafa arranging her marriage to a cousin from Egypt. She has a
        non-Arab suitor of her own. Omar, an employee of Mustafa, is a
        struggling actor who doesn't want to play only terrorists. Mustafa hopes
        to open a real restaurant and has a potential partner in Sam, a Jew,
        whose family objects. What is the price of the American
        dream?</image:caption
