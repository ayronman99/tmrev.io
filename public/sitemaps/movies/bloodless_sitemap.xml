        >A bus drives 5 young couples to an old castle in an unknown location.
        They have responded to an advert looking for people to take part in a
        30-day medical trial. The company running the experiment, led by the
        co-ordinator, explains there will be no contact with the outside world.
        The group are free to leave at any time, but if they do, they will
        forfeit their fee: £20,000 per couple. Mysterious, unexplained events
        occur around the castle and strange noises are heard in the middle of
        the night. At first the group are skeptical – they think the company is
        creating the illusion of a “haunting” to test their reactions, until it
        is revealed there is something more sinister involved.</image:caption
