        >When his wife is abducted by a group of blood-thirsty Vampires, John
        Croix is left to die in a forgotten region of the desert. It is here
        where an unspeakable evil exists. Now, by no choice of his own, Croix
        will come face-to-face with the most terrifying creatures of the night.
        Still a man, but possessing all the strength and power of a werewolf
        when the moon is out, Croix becomes a reluctant hero for mankind when he
        learns that his wife may still be alive. Croix sets out on a mission to
        rescue his wife - venturing deeper and deeper into the Vampire's lair-
        in his quest to save her before she is lost to the world of the undead
        forever.</image:caption
