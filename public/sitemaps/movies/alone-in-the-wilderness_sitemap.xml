        >Dick Proenneke retired at age 50 in 1967 and decided to build his own
        cabin in the wilderness at the base of the Aleutian Peninsula, in what
        is now Lake Clark National Park. Using color footage he shot himself,
        Proenneke traces how he came to this remote area, selected a homestead
        site and built his log cabin completely by himself. The documentary
        covers his first year in-country, showing his day-to-day activities and
        the passing of the seasons as he sought to scratch out a living alone in
        the wilderness.</image:caption
