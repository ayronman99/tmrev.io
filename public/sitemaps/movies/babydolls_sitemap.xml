        >Unable to accept his ex Jess's departure, Billy finds a website that
        allows him to design a sexbot in her image. ‘BabyDolls’ claim that their
        custom made sexbots have the ability to mirror their buyer’s behaviour,
        making them an idyllic partner for the purchaser. After falling victim
        to his own toxicity through Becks' adaptive algorithm, Billy seeks to
        reconcile with Jess but his moment of redemption is cut short by Becks'
        unusual act of revenge.</image:caption
