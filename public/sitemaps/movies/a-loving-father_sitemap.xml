        >Writer Léo Shepherd lives in rural France together with his daughter
        Virginia, who manages his affairs. One day Virginia gets a call from the
        Swedish Academy. Léo has won the Nobel Prize for Literature. His
        estranged son Paul tries desperately to contact him, but is denied every
        time by his sister. When Léo starts traveling to the ceremony in
        Stockholm by motor bike, Paul decides to follow him and try to speak to
        him. Clearly Léo doesn't want to be followed, starts speeding and gets
        involved in a accident, but isn't badly hurt. The police confuse another
        motorist for Shepherd and announce his death. Paul, driven by his
        childhood experiences, decides to kidnap his father.</image:caption
