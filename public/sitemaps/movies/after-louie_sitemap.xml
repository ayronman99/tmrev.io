        >As an AIDS activist and member of ACT UP in the 1980s and 90s, Sam
        witnessed the deaths of too many friends and lovers. Battlewounded and
        struggling with survivor's guilt, Sam now resents the complacency of his
        former comrades and derides what he sees as the younger generation's
        indifference to the politics of sex, and of death. An unexpected
        intimacy with a much younger man challenges Sam's understanding of
        contemporary gay life. Through this unconventional romance, he is forced
        to deal with the trauma that so informs his past, their present, and an
        unknown future.</image:caption
