        >In the Thirteenth century, a group of Satan worshipers, the Knights
        Templar, are captured during a ritual and brutally murdered by the
        locals. Just before the execution, the Knights swear to return from
        their graves to haunt the village and the nearby forest. Centuries
        later, in a post-apocalyptic future, a man and his daughter try to
        survive against both the undead Knights and a sect commanded by a mad
        preacher.</image:caption
