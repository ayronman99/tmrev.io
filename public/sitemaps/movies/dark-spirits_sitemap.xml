        >In this tense, heart-stopping supernatural-thriller, blonde beauty Eva
        foresees the brutal murder of her sister, Tereza – with whom she has
        recently argued – in a dream. Still angry, Tereza refuses to heed her
        warnings and shortly thereafter dies under gruesome and mysterious
        circumstances. In mourning and wracked by guilt, Eva moves to another
        city with her boyfriend. But the increasingly intense and disturbing
        visions continue to plague her … as well as inexplicable sightings of
        her dead sibling. In search of an explanation, she realizes that the
        evil behind her sister’s death is now pursing her!</image:caption
