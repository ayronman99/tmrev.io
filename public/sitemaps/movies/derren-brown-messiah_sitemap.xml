        >Shown on 7 January 2005, Brown traveled to the United States to try to
        convince five leading figures that he had powers in their particular
        field of expertise: Christian evangelism, alien abduction, psychic
        powers, New Age theories and contacting the dead. Using a false name
        each time, Derren succeeded in convincing all of the "experts" that he
        had powers, and four openly endorsed him as a true practitioner. The
        concept of the show was to highlight the power of suggestion with regard
        to beliefs and people's abilities, and failure to question them. His
        conclusion was that people tend to hear only things that support their
        own ideas and ignore contradictory evidence; this is known in psychology
        as confirmation bias.</image:caption
