        >John Logan, a widower and father of two daughters, is struggling to
        balance his job and parenting. Luckily, he has the help of Jillian, his
        wife’s best friend. When an attractive woman moves in across the street,
        John finds himself enjoying her company. Alice, the new neighbor, starts
        spending time at the Logan house, even helping John with the girls. This
        new woman in John’s life is a bit mysterious and she starts getting
        caught in some lies raising the suspicion of Jillian and John’s older
        daughter, Chelsea. When Alice’s ex-husband is found dead, everyone
        starts to wonder if Alice is as sweet as she seems</image:caption
