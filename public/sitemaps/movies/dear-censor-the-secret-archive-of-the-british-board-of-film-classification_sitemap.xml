        >Lifting the lid on the world of cinema censorship, this programme has
        unique access to the files of the British Board of Film Classification.
        Featuring explicit and detailed exchanges between the censor and
        film-makers, 'Dear Censor' casts a wry eye over some of the most
        infamous cases in the history of the board. From the now seemingly
        innocuous Rebel Without a Cause, the first 'naturist' films and the
        infamous works of Ken Russell, and up to Rambo III, this frank and
        surprisingly warm documentary demonstrates how a body created by the
        industry to safeguard standards and reflect shifts in public opinion has
        also worked unexpectedly closely with the film-makers themselves to
        ensure that their work was able reach an audience.</image:caption
