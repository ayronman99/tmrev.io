        >An African American gospel choir is the Greek chorus for a Palestinian
        play on Martin Luther King, Jr. which tours the West Bank, preaching
        nonviolence. The devoutly Christian choir grew up in churches strongly
        allied with Israel. On their first trip to the Holy Land they witness
        the harsh realities of life under occupation, a nonviolent movement for
        justice, and an assassination. Our story is a unique view of a crucial
        human rights conflict. Mixing the excitement of foot-stomping gospel
        music and creative theater it reveals the power of art to communicate,
        heal, and give voice to communities living in fear. It is a cultural
        exchange of immense depth and far-reaching implications, where, during
        the course of the journey, people's preconceptions are radically
        changed.</image:caption
