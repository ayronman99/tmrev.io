        >From 1972 to 1974, the Watergate scandal was frequently a part of “The
        Dick Cavett Show.” In fact, Cavett was at the forefront of national TV
        coverage, interviewing nearly every major Watergate figure as the crisis
        unfolded. With exclusive access to the archive of the show, DICK
        CAVETT’S WATERGATE documents the scandal in the words of the people who
        lived it: from the botched burglary at the Democratic National
        Headquarters; to the must-see TV of the daily Congressional Watergate
        hearings; to the ongoing behind-the-scenes battle between the White
        House and “The Dick Cavett Show,” culminating with the resignation of
        President Nixon on August 9, 1974. DICK CAVETT’S WATERGATE offers a
        unique opportunity to mark the 40th anniversary of a defining moment in
        American history.</image:caption
