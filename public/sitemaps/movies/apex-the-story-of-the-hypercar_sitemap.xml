        >Rocket science meets the auto industry as "APEX" follows a thread that
        starts in the design studios and R&D labs where these "fighter jets of
        the street" are created, and leads to a perilous racetrack in Germany
        where drivers can reach new heights of speed and performance -- if they
        dare. Equal parts human drama and speed, "APEX" follows Swedish
        entrepreneur Christian von Koenigsegg, a lifelong sports car enthusiast
        on a personal quest to build a "mega" car whose golden ratio defies all
        expectations for a hypercar's velocity and power, while competing
        against the biggest names in motorsports for space on the world stage.
        With insights from top engineers and designers, "APEX" pulls back the
        curtain on the top-secret development facilities at Porsche, Ferrari,
        McLaren and Pagani, where awe-inspiring hypercars are imagined and
        built, and puts you inches from the action, as top drivers shake down
        the latest hypercars, flat-out on some of the world's greatest
        racetracks.</image:caption
