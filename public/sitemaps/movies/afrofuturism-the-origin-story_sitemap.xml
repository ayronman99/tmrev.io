        >The term “Afrofuturism” was coined decades ago to describe an artistic
        and cultural tradition that pre-dates the transatlantic slave trade.
        From the poetry of Phillis Wheatley, to Martin R. Delany’s alt-history
        novel Blake, to Sun Ra’s avant-garde music to Marvel’s Black Panther
        (the special’s premiere coincides with the release of that blockbuster
        film’s sequel, Wakanda Forever), the African American experience has
        been explored and reimagined through a speculative, even cosmically
        scaled lens for centuries, in a variety of artistic mediums. The special
        seeks to explore the concept through conversation and performance, as
        some of today’s most influential Black musicians, writers, dancers and
        theorists come together to share their ideas and artistry as they
        celebrate the historical and cultural impact of
        Afrofuturism.</image:caption
