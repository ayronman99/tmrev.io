        >Leonard is serving a life sentence in a Florida prison for the murders
        of Patricia and Chris. Agnes—the victims’ mother and grandmother—decided
        to contact him in the hope it would help her heal from this tragedy and
        give it meaning. As the law didn’t allow her to meet Leonard, she wrote
        to him instead. Their exchange led them to join in a mutual fight to
        promote restorative justice—an alternative stance on justice based on
        prevention and victim/offender dialog. Their struggle echoes those of
        others families, bringing us to examine what restorative justice means
        and the hopes it sparks.</image:caption
