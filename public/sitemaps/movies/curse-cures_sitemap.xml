        >The arrival of a new worker to a jeans factory causes changes to the
        rhythms of the workplace. This mysterious narrative integrates personal
        and collective history with fiction. The visuals were created with both
        found images and original photography reproduced on acetate sheets which
        were subsequently sewn together and projected onto a wall and
        video-taped. This mixed-media work is a reflection on the repetitive
        labour and materiality of textile work and the im/possibilities for
        resistance to challenging working conditions.</image:caption
