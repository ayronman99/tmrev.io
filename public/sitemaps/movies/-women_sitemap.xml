        >Jesus Franco's campy women's prison film is worthwhile for genre
        devotees primarily due to an outstanding cast. Mercedes McCambridge is
        unintentionally hilarious as sadistic lesbian warden Thelma Diaz,
        spitting tacky dialogue with exuberant venom in a performance so
        overbearing that it verges on classic. The plot is standard for the
        genre, as three women (Maria Rohm, Elisa Montes, Luciana Paluzzi) are
        sentenced to an island prison off the Panamanian coast, only to
        encounter torture, rape, and lesbianism. When sympathetic Warden Caroll
        (Maria Schell) replaces Diaz, the prisoners assume that conditions will
        improve, but their agony only worsens until they decide to escape.
        Rosalba Neri co-stars, and Herbert Lom runs the corrupt men's prison
        nearby. 99 Mujeres was heavily censored in various prints, with versions
        running anywhere between 70 and 108 minutes. Edits running 84, 86, and
        94 minutes are most commonly available.</image:caption
