        >King Haji Fisabililah dies in a battle against the Dutch in the Gulf of
        Ketapang. The regalia of the Malay Kingdom is held by the daughter of
        King Haji, Engku Putri Hamidah, but later seized by the Dutch. This
        hurts Engku Putri, especially after seeing the suffering of the people.
        King Hajiâ€™s grandson, King Ali Haji, continues the resistance against
        the Dutch. But his opposition is peaceful by means of his writings. One
        of his most famous works is Gurindam Dua Belas.</image:caption
