        >"Broken Windows" consists of the last footage shot with a digital
        camcorder - these are the dying gasps of the camera. On one level, the
        piece might serve as a de-mystification of the digital image itself; the
        degradation of the image broadly implies the processes by which the real
        world is interpreted as video. Video’s constitution of the world as
        image is laid bare, and it is disconcerting to see the torturous decay
        of the image as the camera fights to maintain its simulation of the
        world. On another level, however, the piece implies the impossible
        mystery of most technology for most viewers. The functioning of the
        camera, evident in the image only when it fails as here, is something
        which most of us can’t - or don’t want to - understand. We understand
        technology so little we must engage with it on a purely aesthetic level
        as a source of magic or wonder, as we do here.</image:caption
