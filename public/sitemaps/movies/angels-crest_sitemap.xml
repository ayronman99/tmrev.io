        >The small working-class town of Angels Crest is a tight-knit community
        resting quietly in one of the vast and stunningly beautiful valleys of
        the Rocky Mountains. Ethan, one of the town's residents, is a young
        father but not much more than a kid himself. He has no choice but to
        look after his three-year-old son Nate, since mom Cindy is an alcoholic.
        But one snowy day, Ethan's good intentions are thwarted by a moment of
        thoughtlessness, resulting in tragedy. A local prosecutor haunted by his
        past goes after Ethan, and the ensuing confusion and casting of blame
        begins to tear the town apart.</image:caption
