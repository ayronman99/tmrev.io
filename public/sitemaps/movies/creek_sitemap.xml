        >A group of friends driving to Las Vegas to attend a Horror convention
        decide to stop at a roadside attraction promising the opportunity to
        find gold. After being told about the ghosts who haunt the Creek, they
        head into the woods to test their luck disbelieving what has been told.
        Soon the friends decide to leave, but their car is missing and the
        roadside attraction is permanently closed. The only thing left to do is
        venture back into the woods and search for their car or anyone that
        could help, but after one friend finds hidden gold the ghosts of the
        Creek begins to stalk the group out of vengeance.</image:caption
