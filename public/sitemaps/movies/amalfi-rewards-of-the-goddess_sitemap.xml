        >A man arrives in the city upon news of a potential terrorist strike in
        Italy. He is Japanese foreign diplomat, Kosaku Kuroda, and he’s here
        under orders of his supervisor at the Foreign Ministry, Hiroshi Kataoka
        (Kiichi Nakai), to aid in the safeguarding of Japanese citizens.
        Kuroda’s main contacts at the Japanese embassy consist of Ambassador
        Kikuhara, Counselor Nishino, and fellow diplomatic envoys Haba and
        Tanimoto. All are busy preparing for the visit of Japanese Foreign
        Minister Kawagoe due to arrive for the high-profile G8 foreign
        minister’s meeting. Meanwhile, somewhere on the festively-lit streets of
        the city, a young Japanese girl has suddenly gone missing. Is it an
        abduction simply for ransom? Or could it be a prelude to
        terror?</image:caption
