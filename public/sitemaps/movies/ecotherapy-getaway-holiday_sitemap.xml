        >Seven women aged between 40 and 80 join the Leaf-Watching & Grand
        Mythical Waterfall & Hot Spring tour. The women chat, pick berries, take
        photos and generally enjoy themselves as they follow their unreliable
        guide to the waterfall. Then the guide disappears, leaving the women
        stranded in the woods. Thrown into an experience far removed from their
        ordinary lives, they become reflective. An open casting call was held to
        search for seven women over the age of 40. Acting experience was not
        required. Director Okita's screenplay comes to life when the cast's
        unique presence and talents combine with the characters.</image:caption
