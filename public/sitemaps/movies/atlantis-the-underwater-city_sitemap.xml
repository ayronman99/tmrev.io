        >During a trip to Stonehenge, two youngsters are kidnapped by a
        mysterious light ray coming from space. These children wake up in an odd
        spacecraft driven by Filnir, an elf with long pointed ears. Their
        destination is the mythical underwater city of Atlantis where Princess
        Lutienne is waiting for the spacecraft. Once she sees them she gets
        rather annoyed as she was longing to see Zoltan, the Legendary magician.
        He would have helped her to rescue the town from the unwelcome invasion
        of the terrible aliens called Egrims. The situation is desperate: how
        can two young human beings face such powerful and big enemies? The
        answer is in this entertaining cartoon! Don't miss it!</image:caption
