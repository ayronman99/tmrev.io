        >Deep Crates 2 documents the history behind diggin for samples and
        creating beats. The 2nd Deep Crates DVD installment takes you back to
        the origins of sampling records with some of the culture's founding
        pioneers. Worldwide diggin spots are exposed from the USA to Canada to
        Japan. From first impressions, Deep Crates 2 appears to be a step up
        from the crude shooting and editing of the original Deep Crates. With a
        shorter list of featured producers, one can expect longer interviews
        with more potency. Features in studio footage and exclusive anecdotes
        from some of the most famous crate diggers on earth.</image:caption
