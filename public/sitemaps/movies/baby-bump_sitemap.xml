        >11-year-old Mickey House is no longer a child. But who is he? He
        doesn’t know. He’s friendless. He doesn’t understand his mother. He
        hates what’s happening to his body. Reality and imagination come
        together in a toxic mix. Events escalate to extremes… at home and at
        school. Mickey has to find the strength within him to put a stop to
        what’s begun. Where will his encounter with his own maturing body take
        him?</image:caption
