        >Barely out of his teens, Rémi dreams of becoming a poet and thrilling
        the world with his powerful and unforgettable verse. Seeking inspiration
        in the oppressively hot city of Sète, pen and notebook in hand, Rémi is
        determined to write his poem... But where to begin? By spending hours
        contemplating the sea? Climbing a mountain? Listening to the birds
        singing? Going to the library? Finding his muse? In bars? In the
        cemetery? Underwater? And if none of that works, then by drinking,
        drinking and drinking some more until that spark of inspiration
        strikes.</image:caption
