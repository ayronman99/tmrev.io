        >A man suffering from debilitating migraines uses trepanation to cure
        his condition and realize his mind’s full potential, and discovers the
        dark side of the ancient surgical practice. By drilling a hole into his
        skull, Tristan will not only realize the true potential of his mind, but
        also gain access to a clandestine home for runaways known as the Garden.
        But just when it begins to look like Tristan is on the path to
        enlightenment, he’s plunged into a terrifying world of eternal
        darkness.</image:caption
