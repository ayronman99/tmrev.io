        >During the Battle of the Bulge in the winter of 1944, thousands of
        American GIs were captured by German forces. Berga: Soldiers of Another
        War, the final work in the distinguished career of four-time Academy
        Award-winning documentary filmmaker Charles Guggenheim, is the untold
        story of 350 American POWs caught in the tragedy of the Holocaust. In
        blatant violation of the Geneva Convention, the Jewish American soldiers
        in the 106th Infantry Division, together with those who had
        "Jewish-sounding" names or who "looked" Jewish, were shipped off to the
        slave-labor camp at Berga am Elster, a satellite camp of the infamous
        Buchenwald.</image:caption
