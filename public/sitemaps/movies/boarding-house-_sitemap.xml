        >Joon-hyeok is preparing to pass the exam for 9th rank government
        worker. Since it is his third attempt, he must pass the exam for sure
        this time. He becomes to live in a boarding house, which is a part of
        his fatherâ€™s extraordinary measures to help his son studying. But what
        has been waiting for Joon-hyeok in the luxurious house was not the thick
        text books, but the two free-spirited women. Joon-hyeok begins his
        cohabitation with Ah-jeong, the owner of the boarding house, who is full
        of voluptuous beauty, and Dal-lae, a nurse, who exudes sex appeal from
        both her face and body. Since then, Joon-hyeok starts to spend every
        night to study women not his books.</image:caption
