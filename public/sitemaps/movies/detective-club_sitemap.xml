        >This is based on a collection of short stories by Keigo Higashino. A
        membership-based investigation agency dedicated to VIP will usually lead
        the case to a quick and calm resolution. Members are only VIPs in the
        political and business world. Tow people are in charge of it, a man in
        his mid-30s who has a deeply carved face away from the Japanese and a
        beautiful woman who seems to be in his late 20s. She works as an
        assistant to the man, and has extraordinary memory. Their group is
        nicknamed the Detective Club by the owners who are VIP
        members.</image:caption
