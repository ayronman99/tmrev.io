        >Isabellaâ€™s marriage is falling apart, and something needs to change to
        keep her and her husband Patrick together. When Isabella is invited to
        an exclusive Hawaiian yoga retreat run by the famous yoga guru Remy
        Morrow, Patrick insists she go and try to find herself. Hopefully, this
        time apart and this time for Isabella to center herself will improve
        their life together. But when Isabella arrives in paradise, she soon
        discovers the retreat is not what it seems, and neither is Remy.
        Isabella must put herself to the test physically and emotionally to
        survive a psychopath who is stalking and killing the retreat guests.
        Once his sights are set on her, paradise becomes hell on
        earth.</image:caption
