        >Tired of horror comedies that forget the horror, the laughs, even both?
        Us too. Get ready for a true horror comedy - Bigfoot. Divided into three
        acts - the first two comedy, then horror in the final act - to balance
        laughs with shrieks. Bigfoot is the true horror comedy. PART ONE -
        COMEDY Sick of TV squatching shows? Bigfoots Are. And they know just how
        to even the score, through juvenile schoolyard pranks. Now the joke is
        on for us unwary humans. PART TWO - COMEDY Bigfoots have the problems
        humans have. They seek love and inner peace through therapy and psychic
        readings and experience intimacies, idiosyncrasies, impotencies, and
        fetishes. Oh the humanity. PART THREE - HORROR When unsuspecting campers
        wander into their territory, bigfoots attack. Now a crew of hunters and
        scientists, dispatched to capture or kill, join a stranger with a
        psychic and sensual link to the creatures. Whether defending their
        woods, or bent on revenge, dinner is served.</image:caption
