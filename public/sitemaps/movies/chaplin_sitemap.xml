        >Bangshi Das is an impersonator of Charlie Chaplin. He earns peanuts by
        being the 'joker' at birthday parties. However, he prefers to call
        himself an actor rather than a worker. His life circles around his son
        who is the greatest critic of his performances. Poverty never seems
        bitter as the father-son duo knows how to make fun of it.</image:caption
