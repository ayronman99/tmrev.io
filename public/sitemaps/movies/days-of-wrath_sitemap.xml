        >Back in his high school days, Joon-Seok was bullied by Chang-Sik
        Because of this, Joon-Seok's high school days were like a nightmare.
        Now, Joon-Seok finds it difficult to live a normal life due to the
        bullying. Meanwhile, Chang-Sik, who has forgotten what he did to
        Jeon-Seok, lives a relatively happy life. He is about to marry Ji-Hee.
        Joon-Seok will pay him back for all the misery.</image:caption
