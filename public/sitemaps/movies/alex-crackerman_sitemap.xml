        >Alex Crackerman is the second movie added on to the Crackerman series.
        The first movie was Kenny Crackerman. Alex Crackerman is Kenny's
        brother. Unlike Kenny Alex is smart. Kenny is dumb and stupid. Alex is
        very nerdy and has no friends. Just like his brother he is beat up, and
        he's, well, he's sort of the teacher's pet but not really. Alex will be
        beaten up. He will be beaten up by his grandfather. He will go to places
        where no kid will ever venture. He will be in placeâ€”he will be in places
        where nothing should ever happen.</image:caption
