        >Testing the boundaries of political-incorrectness, the story focuses on
        characters who never have attained anything through honorable means.
        They prefer to use lying, cheating, stealing, or brute force. Take, for
        instance, the pharmacy student who uses his skils to make date-rape
        drugs, and he sells these concoctions in order to pay tuition. While
        each "dirtbag" has his own plotline, all become obstacles to the main
        character - a dirtbag who is at the crossroads of change. Will he find
        redemption or destruction?</image:caption
