        >In 1987, Suse's boyfriend Matthias flees the GDR with her best friend
        Susanne. The escape fails. They fall into the hands of the secret
        police, who try to break their will. It's not until sixteen years later
        that the three of them meet again. Before the reunion they visit the
        sites of their youth, their escape, and their imprisonment. They begin
        to recall their collective past - the only remnant that connects their
        lives today.</image:caption
