        >This documentary emphasizes that people have strong feelings about the
        mullet - very popular hair style among lesbians, race car drivers and
        others. The general attitude about the mullet is not all positive; some
        people are even harassed for having one. The director toured the USA
        asking one and all what they thought about this coif. The journey is not
        only hilariously funny, it's also enlightening. Turns out, the mullet
        isn't just a dyke cut. Musicians, bikers and Latino soccer players all
        love that style.</image:caption
