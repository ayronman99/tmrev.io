        >Aoi Kuruma (A Blue Automobile) focuses on such a character - a
        part-time DJ and record-store employee named Richio (Arata). With his
        spiky yellow hair, wrap-around shades and pale mask of a face, Richio
        would seem to be an icy moon circling the distant planet of his own
        regard. But as Okuhara shows us from the first scene, Richio has been
        traumatized by a boyhood horror - and still bears the physical scars on
        one eye, the emotional scars in dreams and visions he can neither escape
        nor explain away. The sunglasses and mask are there for a reason, the
        pain and rage are real. At the same time, he has a straightforwardness
        that verges on the cruel - but this is also one of his most appealing
        qualities.</image:caption
