        >With humor and wit, Crushed Lives â€“ Sex or Kids? takes on the probing
        but taboo question: what happens to our sex lives after children? New
        father Saverio films a documentary to get to the bottom of this matter
        after an uninspired sex session with his wife. Interviewing couples at
        various stages of parenthood, Saverio unearths the fear and anxieties
        that seem to universally plague his peers as they collectively
        experience the quiet devastation of a dying bedroom. Honing in on this
        seldom fully explored theme of adulthood, director Alessandro Colizzi
        brings us on a sincere and funny journey into life encumbered by
        children and the fainting sexual imagination that seems to go with it. -
