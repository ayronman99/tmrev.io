        >A story about modern family relationships, as seen through the eyes of
        15 year-old David. Six years after his dad dies in a car crash, David's
        mum moves in with the new man in her life. As the two families come
        together - complete with teenage step brothers and sisters, a crushingly
        acerbic granny and one feisty, American self-help guru ex-wife - David
        has fantasies of his father's ghost returning to disrupt the new
        step-family and test its survival.</image:caption
