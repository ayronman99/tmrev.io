        >When the movie opens Devan(Arun Pandiyan) murdering photographer
        Jeeva(Thalaivasal Vijay) in cold blood in his house. Jeeva strategically
        positions a video camera to capture the impending murder but Devan never
        shows his face to it. And when Jeeva shouts out the name of his killer
        before dying, the audio is lost at that point. While the police search
        for the killer, Devan zeroes in on Chetta (Saikumar) as his next target.
        He follows Chetta to Chandigarh but is apprehended by CBI officer
        Ratnavel(Vijayakanth). But once Ratnavel realises Chetta's true nature,
        he begins to help Devan, even hiring successful lawyer
        Chakravarthy(Karthik) to fight for him. The flashback shows that Devan's
        sister (Kausalya) was killed by Chetta, Devan wants to avenge the death
        of his sister. In the climax, villain is killed.</image:caption
