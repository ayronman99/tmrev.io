        >Seven years ago, Lopplc and Morina were playing at a park. Suddenly
        they felt an earthquake on the Koya Koya Planet. The quake was so
        massive that the planet was destroyed. Everyone had to escape using a
        giant ship. A sudden bolt of lightning damaged the ship, causing a power
        failure. The Professor (who was Morina's father) wanted to fix the
        spaceship, but another lightning strike took him to another
        dimension.</image:caption
