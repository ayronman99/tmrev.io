        >Nassim, a 16-year-old boy, is placed with a family in the suburbs
        following the death of his drug addict mother. But he refuses to
        integrate into the social setting that surrounds him. He invents another
        life for himself, similar to that of his mates at the big Parisian high
        school he goes to. Thereâ€™s no reason for that to change. His two lives,
        his home life and his school life, must be kept separate at all
        costs.</image:caption
