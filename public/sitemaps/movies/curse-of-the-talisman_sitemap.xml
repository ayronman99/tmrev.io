        >Attempting to do a favor, teenager Jeremy Campbell, (Jesse Spencer) is
        given a strange statue from his work and keeps it in his basement. Given
        a box of strange charms as well, he becomes fascinated with a strange
        talisman found inside. Using it as leverage to meet Fiona, (Sara
        Gleeson) and Miranda, (Tempany Deckert) from school and get invited to a
        Halloween Party, he becomes convinced that the statue has come alive and
        produced a hibernating bat. Tracking down the collection, priest
        Eccleston, (Rob Mullinar) arrives in town to see that the statues are
        safe, which really contain a race of gargoyles from the Middle Ages that
        were to destroy the world before being turned to stone. It manages to
        get loose from his basement, it launches a reign of terror through the
        community that doesn't seem to end. Realizing the true intentions of the
        gargoyles, they race to stop them before they complete their
        mission.</image:caption
