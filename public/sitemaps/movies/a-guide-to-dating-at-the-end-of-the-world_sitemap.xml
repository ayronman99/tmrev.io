        >After their first date, Alex declares she would not go out with John
        even if he were the last man on Earth. The next day she wakes to find he
        is exactly that. With everyone gone they have time to get to know each
        other and all is going swell until they meet Wendy, the smarter and
        prettier 'other woman' - and she has a plan to bring everyone back. Will
        Wendy come between Alex and John as she tries to save the world? Not if
        Alex and her trusty Epilady have anything to do with it. Sometimes all
        it takes is an apocalyptic catastrophe to help you find your true
        love.</image:caption
