        >The beloved, Emmy-winning comic actor Don Knotts, best-known for his
        roles as the bumbling deputy Barney Fife on The Andy Griffith Show and
        the lecherous landlord Mr. Furley on Three's Company, presents a series
        of side-splitting stand-up routines and skits in rare performances from
        the 1960s-1970s. A master at playing nervous and neurotic characters,
        Knotts is also able to milk major laughs with his portrayals of
        romantically-challenged underdogs possessing oversized egos. In this
        special comedy collection, he is joined by singer-actress Joey
        Heatherton, actress Jane Powell, former Dallas Cowboys player Lance
        Rentzel, comic Jack Burns, Knott's Love God movie co-star Maureen Arthur
        and the legendary Jimmy Durante.</image:caption
