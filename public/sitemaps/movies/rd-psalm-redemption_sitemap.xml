        >Five years have passed and Luther still blames Detective John Smith for
        destroying his life, as John had helped convict Luther on a murder
        charge. After being denied parole, Luther, along with two goons, escapes
        from prison. John, now married, is a minister and stepfather to an
        adolescent girl. Seeking revenge, Luther and his goons break into John's
        house and hold his family hostage. John makes a harrowing attempt to
        coax Luther to do the right thing - but will he do it?</image:caption
