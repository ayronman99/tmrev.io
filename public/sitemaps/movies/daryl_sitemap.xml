        >Daryl is a normal 10-year-old boy in many ways. However, unbeknown to
        his foster parents and friends, Daryl is actually a government-created
        robot with superhuman reflexes and mental abilities. Even his name has a
        hidden meaning -- it's actually an acronym for Data Analyzing Robot
        Youth Life-form. When the organization that created him deems the "super
        soldier" experiment a failure and schedules Daryl to be disassembled, it
        is up to a few rogue scientists to help him escape.</image:caption
