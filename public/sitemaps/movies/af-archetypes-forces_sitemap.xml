        >It is the year 2124, and the crew of a medical transport ship are
        carrying dangerous cargo to its destination. The contents, though mostly
        unknown, are rumored to be viral in nature, and must not be let out
        under any circumstances. But when a leak occurs, the ship, as well as
        the crew, is at risk of being destroyed. With only two robotic space
        suits and limited ammo, can they escape in time, or are their fates
        sealed?</image:caption
