        >The story of Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a German clergyman of great
        distinction, who actively opposed Hitler and the Nazis. His convictions
        cost him his life. What is a moral person to do in a time of savage
        immorality? That question tormented Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a German
        clergyman of great distinction who actively opposed Hitler and the
        Nazis. His convictions cost him his life. The Nazis hanged him on April
        9, 1945, less than a month before the end of the war. Bonhoeffer's last
        years, his participation in the German resistance and his moral struggle
        are dramatized in this film. More than just a biographical portrait,
        Bonhoeffer: Agent of Grace sheds light on the little-known efforts of
        the German resistance. It brings to a wide audience the heroic rebellion
        of Bonhoeffer, a highly regarded Lutheran minister who could have kept
        his peace and saved his life on several occasions but instead paid the
        ultimate price for his beliefs.</image:caption
