        >ABBA - THE LAST VIDEO is the film about four hopeful musicians in
        search of a record contract. They pay a visit to the Big Record Company
        Boss and his oily assistant, performing one hit after the other, cheered
        on by their manager. But things don't really work out as
        planned...Agnetha, Bjorn, Benny and Frida look just like they did back
        then... or perhaps not.</image:caption
