        >Managers Im Yoo-na and Kang Ji-won looked like an in-house couple.
        However, Yoo-na will actually marry team leader Byeong-seok who has a
        heart for her. Even after marriage, Yoo-na can't seem to forget Ji-won.
        Byeong-seok thinks that he's having a stable marital relationship with
        Yoo-na, but he can't relate to her feelings. He deliberately invites
        Ji-won to his home. Byeong-seok's obsession gets worse, and the three
        hide their true feelings for each other, and the relationship becomes
        strange.</image:caption
