        >Baghdad fell after just twenty-one days of combat, but the capture of
        Saddam Hussein took a further eight months and was played out amid a
        brutal guerrilla war in which the hunters frequently became the hunted.
        The dictator had simply disappeared and finding him dead or alive was a
        top priority for US forces. The search for Saddam quickly became a real
        life crime drama as investigators combined sophisticated software and
        old-fashioned police work to tighten the noose on Saddam's inner circle.
        Ace in the Hole is the first-hand story of the US Army investigators who
        tracked down every lead until their final raid uncovered the Iraqi
        dictator cowering in his 'spider-hole.</image:caption
