        >Violante, a young and beautiful catholic nun, is facing a few marital
        issues with her husband Jesus Christ - who stalks her through the dark
        corners of a decaying convent and seeks to punish her for her (alleged)
        sins. In a dark stormy night they struggle to win each other to their
        personal points of view. She quotes the bible in terms of unconditional
        love - He does the same in terms of capital punishment. But are His
        manly insecurities based on solid grounds? After escaping His jealous
        rage, the nun lurks through the dark alleys and the bars like a vampire.
        Doomed to loneliness, all she wants is a Man. And who can this Man
        be?</image:caption
