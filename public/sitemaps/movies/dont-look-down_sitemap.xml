        >Urban free climbers are a new breed of daredevils, young men and women
        who illegally climb cranes and buildings without any safety equipment,
        then hang from them, hundreds of metres above the ground, one slip from
        certain death... Free climbing originated in Eastern Europe, but has
        recently spread to Britain. James Kingston is a 23-year-old who lives
        with his mother near Southampton. In his spare time James scales the
        local 100m cranes and 200m radio towers. Now James embarks on a journey
        to the spiritual home of urban free climbing, Ukraine, where he teams up
        with the infamous Mustang Wanted, the craziest climber of them all. As
        Mustang and James explore Kiev, the pair push themselves to new
        extremes, climbing derelict buildings and tightrope-walking hundreds of
        metres above the city, before finally heading to the iconic Moscow
        bridge to attempt Mustang's latest death defying stunt. Don't Look Down
        is fascinating, revealing and nerve-wracking.</image:caption
