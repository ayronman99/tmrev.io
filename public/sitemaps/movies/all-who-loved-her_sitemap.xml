        >Rianne Angers has spent the last nine years obsessing over the vicious
        murder of Gwen Anderson. And it is understandable: Her brother Nick went
        to prison for the crime. Now that Nick is back, he needs her help to
        find who really killed Gwen. About to finish school and take the next

        her older brother pulling her back into the past.</image:caption
