        >A young up and coming artist in New York city has his life and dreams
        forever altered when the tragic events of 9/11 take the lives of his two
        best friends and he accepts guardianship of the couple's two young
        daughters. Now eleven years later, and teaching art at an elementary
        school, he raises the girls as if they were his own, but the financial
        grind to live in NYC is too much, so he decides to take the girls away
        from the only place they've ever called home and move back to Buffalo
        where he grew up. This "non-traditional" family now faced with change,
        new surroundings, and a new journey, must learn how to adjust to this
        new life, while trying to find themselves along the way.</image:caption
