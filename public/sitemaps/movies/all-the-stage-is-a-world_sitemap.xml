        >Every year in Virginia Beach, the theater departments from eleven
        different schools go head up in a one act play competition of their own
        choosing, whether it be an adaptation of a well known work or a creation
        all their own. We follow a few of these theater departments as they
        prepare for the big competition, revealing what itâ€™s like to deal with
        the stress of theater production, while having to go through teenage
        high school crap at the same time.</image:caption
