        >Nick Anderson, Kevin Daniels, and Tracey Green do everything together.
        They are the best of friends, and yet they couldn't be more different.
        Neighbors from adolescence, they finish each other's thoughts and
        sentences, joys and pains, happiness and tears. Using Nick's house as
        their own members only clubhouse, they escape into their own world of
        contentment. Yet the inevitable intrusion of others tests their
        stability in ways never imagined.</image:caption
