        >The story is about David Gates, a cryptozoologist who is hired to film
        his investigations. One of them being a mysterious town where all of
        it's inhabitants have vanished without a trace. David uncovers far more
        than he anticipated and puts his own life at risk. Afterwards David
        begins to feel the bizarre effects from the town within his own biology.
        Mean while he is sent by his investor to film an exorcism. Something
        that is completely outside of his expertise. Already suffering from
        unnatural symptoms, David, who is now reluctantly in the presence of
        pure evil, fears that multiple inhuman forces are tearing him apart from
        inside.</image:caption
