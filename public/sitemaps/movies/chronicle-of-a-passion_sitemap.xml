        >Giovanni and Anna are a married couple in their sixties who have lived
        together all their lives, with honestly and dignity. However, in the
        past few years the economic crisis has hit town and work, Anna has not
        been able to keep up her payments and she has accumulated a debt with
        the tax authorities. For Giovanni and Anna this marks the beginning of
        an inexorable ordeal which will lead them to lose first their home, then
        their work, and ultimately their privacy.</image:caption
