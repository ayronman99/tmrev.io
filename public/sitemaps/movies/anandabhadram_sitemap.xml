        >In the ancient village of Shivapuram, little Ananthan hears a tale from
        his mother, Gayathri (Revathi). She tells him that his family comes from
        a line of powerful magicians, and they are responsible for protecting
        nagamanikyam, a jewel on a serpent's head. The jewel, she narrates, lies
        in a secret place in the house guarded by snakes, including a tiny snake
        called Kunjootan. Years later, obeying the wishes of his dead mother,
        Ananthan (Prithviraj Sukumaran) returns to his ancestral village to
        light the lamps at Shivakavu, a dark and mysterious temple of
        Shiva.</image:caption
