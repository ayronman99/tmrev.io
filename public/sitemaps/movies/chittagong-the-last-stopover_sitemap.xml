        >Moti, a ten-year-old Bengali boy, tells us about his country, his life
        and an encounter that marked his life, that of Paul Danvin, a French
        captain, who, with a heavy heart, has just let the scrap merchants of
        the sea attack the hull of his boat with a blowtorch. In Chittagong,
        Bangladesh, Paul finds himself without a crew, without papers and
        without a future. He takes the train to Dhaka, the capital, and meets
        Moti and her mother Alima. By instinct or by fascination, Paul follows
        them to the village of Rulipara, built on a strip of land protected from
        the Jamuna River by dykes. While the monsoon rages, and the Jamuna
        destroys the houses of Rulipara, condemning the population to a new
        exile, Alima and Paul engage in a desperate struggle to live their love
        without hindrance.</image:caption
