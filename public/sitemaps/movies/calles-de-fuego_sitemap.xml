        >Ani and Niko are 16 and dating, but their lives couldn't be more
        different. She is the daughter of a taxi driver and a housewife and has
        always been happy and contented. Niko delivers pizzas, his mother is an
        alcoholic since his father abandoned them and his brother is a gang
        member and drug addict. The world of the young couple is altered by the
        increasingly frequent appearance of burned cars on weekends. Organized
        neighborhood patrols in the working class neighborhood will eventually
        trigger a tragedy that will affect them both.</image:caption
