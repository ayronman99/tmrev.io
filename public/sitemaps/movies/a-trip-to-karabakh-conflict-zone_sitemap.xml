        >The Soviet Union has collapsed. Civil and ethnic wars have broken out
        in Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia, three republics in the Caucasus.
        The post-Soviet Caucasus have turned into one large conflict zone. Two
        radically different people with different ideals, problems, and goals
        are united by the conflict zone. Gogliko, a Tbilisi street boy, and
        Spartak, a Sukhumi sniper, are forced to solve problems of the street
        and problems of the state together. For one, the goal is to get back the
        money he lost gambling; for the other, it is to carry out a general's
        absurd military mission. In spite of it all, their paths cross and their
        lives are changed forever.</image:caption
