        >In Becoming Frederick Douglass, acclaimed director Stanley Nelson and
        co-director Nicole London bring to life the story of an American icon.
        Using Douglass's own powerful, profound speeches and writing, the story
        retraces his journey from a man born and raised in slavery to one of the
        most prominent elder statesmen and inspiring voices for freedom in
        American history. With additional context and insight provided by
        historians, scholars and Douglass's descendants, the filmmakers recount
        the brutality and trauma of his childhood while illuminating his
        strength of character, defiance against the bonds of slavery and the
        influences that guided his lifelong quest for freedom. The most
        celebrated Black man of his era, Douglass's legacy and achievements
        continue to resonate today. His life and work still inspires activists,
        educators and citizens in the fight for freedom, equality and a more
        just American society.</image:caption
