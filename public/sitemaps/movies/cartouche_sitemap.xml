        >In the 18th century, Louis de Bourguignon is working with the
        Malichot's gang, but their ways are too 'unethical' for him. He creates
        his own band, acting under the name of Cartouche, making audacious
        robberies of the rich people, and even distributing the takings with the
        poor. Thus, cartouche attracts the people's sympathies, Venus's love,
        and hate from the Police and Malichot... Cartouche can escape all the
        traps they set at him - except the entrapments of love. Eventually, he
        will be saved by a woman, at her own cost.</image:caption
