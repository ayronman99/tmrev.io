        >Lester, the star player of their community basketball team who dreams
        of playing at the country's premier league, but encounters a problem on
        the way to PBA (Philippine Basketball Association). He meets Pandy
        (Arnel Ignacio), a couturier who is smitten by Lester's looks. Pandy
        becomes the team's manager and helps him become part of the college's
        varsity team. Pandy is obviously in love with Lester, a straight guy
        devoted to his childhood sweetheart Denise (Sofia Valdez). Lester is at
        a loss when Pandy's love for him turns into an obsession.</image:caption
