        >Dr. Professor is the most powerful supervillain of his time. However,
        Dr Professor has lost his interest for his life’s work. A career, that
        arose from love of destruction, fear and violence has turned into a
        marketing circus. Dr. Professor has become a prisoner of his own fame
        and status as an adored supervillain. His public relations machinery,
        that used to serve him, has become his master. And he’s not
        pleased.</image:caption
