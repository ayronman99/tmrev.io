        >Still Not A Player takes us on an intimate journey through the life of
        Christopher "Big Punisher" Rios via the stories of those closest to him.
        From his blood and spit struggles on the mean streets to his rise to the
        top of the hip-hop world to this large man's losing war with his
        700-pound bulk. This unique, frightening, ugly, painful, haunting, and
        occasionally, beautiful story is a high-steppin' razor that slashes into
        the heart, bones and belly of one of hip-hop's greatest players,
        offering unquestionably the most intimate look ever inside the hard
        world of hip-hop and into the ravaged yet hopeful life of one of its
        most popular and legendary figures.</image:caption
