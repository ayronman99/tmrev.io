        >An omnibus of short films about gay men’s relationships and partings.
        Kim Chuja is a fantasy musical about two men who were lovers in the past
        and meet by chance. Floating Island is a quiet, sad love story about a
        man who wants to leave and a man who wants to hold him back. In La
        Traviata, a woman comes to Bogil Island to meet her dead husband’s
        lover. She’s angry when she sees him happy. She sees the red camellia
        flowers and she comes to terms with her husband’s homosexuality while
        recovering from the hurt.</image:caption
