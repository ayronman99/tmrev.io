        >This film tells (using modern day interviews and archival footage and
        sound tapes) the story of how in 1967, while his band The Beach Boys
        triumphantly toured abroad, Brian Wilson was trying to push the
        boundaries of conventional pop music with a new follow-up to the Beach
        Boys' cutting-edge mega-hit, Pet Sounds. The new album was to be called
        "SMiLE". SMiLE pushed the envelope both musically and lyrically, and was
        supposed to out-do the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper record. But Brian wasn't
        able to sell the project to his band-mates when they returned. The
        project was shelved and Wilson's well-documented decline into
        depression, drug abuse, recluseness, and obesity had begun. Thirty-odd
        years later, Wilson announced that in 2004, SMiLE would be performed
        live in its entirety in London. This film tells the story of a damaged
        but healing artist bringing his greatest work to light.</image:caption
