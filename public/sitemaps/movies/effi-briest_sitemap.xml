        >Following her parents' wishes, spirited seventeen-year-old Effi Briest
        marries Baron von Innstetten – a former admirer of her mother – who is
        twenty years Effi's senior. This marriage of prudence heralds the
        beginning of a humdrum life, far from home, for Effi. Innstetten devotes
        himself entirely to his political career, and the sleepy small town of
        Kessin has very little to offer in terms of variety. But then, one day,
        Innstetten's old regimental comrade, Major Crampas – a charming
        womanizer – arrives on the scene.</image:caption
