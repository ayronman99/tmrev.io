        >Passeurs de Reves opens with longtime sweethearts Dolovan and Zara
        fleeing from their Mesopotamian village, which has been ravaged by
        ethnic warfare. As they make their way across the frigid Caucasian
        Mountains, Zara's parents, who are traveling with the couple, succumb to
        the elements. Dolovan and Zara eventually make it to a run-down evacuee
        camp presided over by a friendly Kurdish "tsar," where Zara discovers
        that her deceased father's suitcase is filled with cash. Although this
        is ostensibly good news, the cash makes the couple vulnerable to
        smugglers, dodgy guides, and counterfeiters, all of whom are eager to
        take advantage of Dolovan and Zara's newfound wealth. To further
        complicate matters, although they have money, the couple lack necessary
        visas to continue their journey, and soon Dolovan is taken away by the
        police. Abandoned in the Ukraine, Zara is robbed and then disappears,
        while Dolovan, traveling solo, eventually makes it to Paris to reunite
        with his love.</image:caption
