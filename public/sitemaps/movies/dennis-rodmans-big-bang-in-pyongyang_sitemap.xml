        >Dennis Rodman is on a mission. After forging an unlikely friendship
        with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, he wants to improve relations
        between North Korea and the US by staging a historic basketball game
        between the two countries. But the North Korean team isn't the only
        opposition he'll face... Condemned by the NBA and The Whitehouse, and
        hounded every step of the way by the press, can Dennis keep it together
        and make the game happen? Or will it go up in a mushroom cloud of smoke?
        For the first time, discover the true story of what happened when Dennis
        Rodman took a team of former-NBA players to North Korea and staged the
        most controversial game of basketball the world has never
        seen.</image:caption
