        >Brooklyn Castle is a documentary about I.S. 318 – an inner-city school
        where more than 65 percent of students are from homes with incomes below
        the federal poverty level – that also happens to have the best, most
        winning junior high school chess team in the country. (If Albert
        Einstein, who was rated 1800, were to join the team, he’d only rank
        fifth best.) Chess has transformed the school from one cited in 2003 as
        a “school in need of improvement” to one of New York City’s best. But a
        series of recession-driven public school budget cuts now threaten to
        undermine those hard-won successes.</image:caption
