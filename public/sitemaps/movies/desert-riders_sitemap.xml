        >Camel racing is a popular sport in the Middle East. In past years,
        thousands of young boys have been trafficked from Bangladesh, Pakistan,
        Mauritania and other countries to work as jockeys in the UAE under
        excruciating conditions. Over the last 10 years, some governments have
        tried to put an end to the use of child jockeys. Desert Riders will
        examine the situation before and since these government policies were
        enacted, as well as the difficult journey to retrieve and recuperate
        these children</image:caption
