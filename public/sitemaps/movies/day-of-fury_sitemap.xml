        >The decisions of six individuals collide during a day out of control,
        where they seek to change what seems inevitable. Michael gets into
        serious trouble when he has to settle a debt with Tony, a peculiar
        criminal. Rafael fulfills his dream of being a cop, but discovers that
        the job also involves testing his ideals. Manuel and Arthur are two
        students who discover that the way to make easy money does not always
        Java a point of return. Sergio carries the weight of the death of his
        brother and has to face his fears when an intruder threatens his
        family.</image:caption
