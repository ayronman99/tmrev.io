        >Dara O Briain - This Is the Show was recorded in front of a sell-out
        crowd on the final date of his record-breaking nine nights at the world
        famous Hammersmith Apollo. Dara is on top form as he effortlessly mixes
        off the cuff audience interaction with razor sharp material and a star
        studded finale that almost puts Hollywood to shame. "O Briain is loud
        and large and fast and feisty...............but the way he tells 'em is
        a joy" - The Times "O Briain has a laser eye for the absurd and the
        spurious amid the too-much-stuff with which we shore up our hapless
        lives" - The Guardian "Breakneck genius...... the entire audience was
        hanging on every sentence. And every sentence ended in a laugh. It was
        stuffed with dazzling observations, vivid vignettes and glorious gags."
