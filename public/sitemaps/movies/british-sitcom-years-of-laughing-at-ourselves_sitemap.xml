        >Documentary celebrating the British sitcom and taking a look at the
        social and political context from which our favourite sitcoms grew. We
        enjoy a trip through the comedy archive in the company of the people who
        made some of the very best British sitcoms. From The Likely Lads to I'm
        Alan Partridge, we find out the inspiration behind some of the
        most-loved characters and how they reflect the times they were living
        in.</image:caption
