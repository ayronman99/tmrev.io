        >Papa has long promised his daughter Mika that he will take her to the
        beach during summer vacation, but as a golf caddy he keeps getting
        called into work when the weekend rolls around. This time, she even had
        a new inflatable toy she wanted to bring to share with her father and go
        swimming in the ocean together: A dugong she names Dudu. Unbeknownst to
        her, her father is very afraid of the water due to a childhood
        incident.</image:caption
