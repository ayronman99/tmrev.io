        >A discussion by friends with long-winded histories and a love of
        drinking results in four of them running off to house-sit for a long
        weekend while playing Killer, a schoolyard game where each player has to
        "take out" targets over a period of time using everything from water
        pistols to bits of cardboard with "sword" written on them. As the game
        progresses and frustrations rise, sexual tensions surface and it's
        obvious that with the possibility of only one winner, some people will
        do anything for victory. Dead Man Drinking is a full-length independent
        feature-film released for free under a creative commons 3.0
        license.</image:caption
