        >Dennis Buckstead has the hardest calling in his church. Not only has he
        been asked to coach a group of non-basketball players in his church but
        the bishop has demanded that he lead the team to the Basketball
        Championship. Word from the top is that this is the last season of
        church ball and Bishop Linderman isn't about to have his team lose for
        the 20th year in a row in the last season of church ball history! What
        was supposed to strengthen the body, invigorate the mind and cultivate
        brotherly love seems to bring out the worst in these church-going ball
        players. Dennis must find a way to bring his team together and build
        unity along the way to win the championship or go down in church ball
        history as the worst team that ever played.</image:caption
