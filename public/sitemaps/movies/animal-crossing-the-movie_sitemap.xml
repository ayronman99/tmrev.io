        >This is the story of a young self-reliant girl called Ai, who one day,
        moves into the Animal Village. While working at Tom Nook's shop "Nook's
        Cranny" she begins living her life away from her family. To begin with,
        she doesn't know left from right, but under the guidance of Mayor
        Tortimer, the angry but correct Mr. Resetti, and the wandering musician
        K.K. Slider among others, she is eventually accepted as a member of the
        village. One night as she walked along the beach, she finds a message in
        the bottle. It sets her off on a quest of planting pine trees around the
        village to fulfill a miracle on the eve of the Winter
        Festival</image:caption
