        >Imagine two flowers pollinating on screen for 75 minutes - welcome to
        Aravind SA's "I Was Not Ready Da". This is that show that the whole
        family should watch - just not together. From his teenage love for white
        people and chatroom, to his all inclusive approach to strip clubs in
        America, SA walks us through many such contradictions of traumatising
        Sanskrit tutors, to provoking news anchors in their own shows. Get ready
        to meet SA, the man who is finally ready to tell you about the times
        life threw shit, and he hilariously took the hit.</image:caption
