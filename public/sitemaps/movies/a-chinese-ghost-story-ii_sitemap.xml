        >Several years after his beloved Nieh has gone, Ning is innocently put
        into jail. Luckily, he meets a scholar, Elder Chu Kot, in the prison who
        finally helps him escape. Ning then meets a young witty monk Autumn.
        They become friends and live in an abandoned villa together. The villa
        is horrific, yet they choose to stay for a while. Later that night, some
        ghosts suddenly appear and attack; two parties fight heavily. But after
        clarifications, Ning and Autumn find that "the ghosts" are humans in
        disguise, who intend to save their leader from imprisonment but not
        hurting innocence. Among them, Ning finds someone who looks identical to
        Nieh, and considers she is the reincarnated Nieh. A real giant zombie
        has seen all these in behind and is ready to ambush.</image:caption
