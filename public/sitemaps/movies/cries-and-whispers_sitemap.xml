        >As Agnes slowly dies of cancer, her sisters are so deeply immersed in
        their own psychic pains that they can't offer her the support she needs.
        Maria is wracked with guilt at her husband's attempted suicide, caused
        by his discovery of her extramarital affair. The self-loathing, suicidal
        Karin seems to regard her sister with revulsion. Only Anna, the deeply
        religious maid who lost her young child, seems able to offer Agnes
        solace and empathy.</image:caption
