        >This film, the first in what has become a semi-autobiographical trilogy
        for Smihi, follows the everyday experiences of Mohamed-Larbi Salmi
        against the changing Moroccan society. In 1950s Tangier, Larbi Salmi is
        a young, timid, pre-teen, boy, trying to make sense of the gentle
        religious upbringing of his father, the secular education offered him in
        French school, and his budding desires for the forbidden pleasures of
        the cinema and the women he meets through it.</image:caption
