        >A Night at the Movies: The Gigantic World of Epics looks at Hollywood’s
        biggest screen spectaculars from all sides, including the genre’s
        beginnings, literary adaptations, great epic directors and actors, the
        challenges of making big-budget movies, classic set-pieces and epic
        music scores. The special also looks at how the genre fell out of favor
        with audiences and filmmakers in the ‘70s and ‘80s, only to be reborn
        with more recent films like Gladiator, and Dances with Wolves trilogy.
        Throughout, the special is packed with classic scenes and
        behind-the-scenes images from such films as The Birth of a Nation
        (1915), Gone With the Wind (1939), Samson & Delilah (1949), The Ten
        Commandments (1956), Ben-Hur (1959), El Cid (1961), King of Kings
        (1961), Lawrence of Arabia (1962) and Doctor Zhivago
        (1965).</image:caption
