        >Follows experiments of fictional 19th century aristocrat Monsieur
        Lautréamont, a hypochondriac dandy committed to the pursuit of true
        aesthetic perfection which he calls “urge-ingeniousness”. The film
        focuses on the interplay between Lautréamont and Louise, his seductive
        servant, and switches back and forth between Bock as the master and his
        reliance on Louise who is all at once nurse, servant, inspiration and
        lover. The film crosses the boundaries of surreal fantasy and period
        drama, with Bock playing the tormented genius, an inventor attempting to
        achieve perfection in every creative aspect: poetry, perfume, and even
        nature. Filmed at Chateau du Bosc, the family home of the aristocratic
        dwarf Henri de Toulouse Lautrec. Toulouse Lautrec is clearly the
        inspiration for Bock’s character</image:caption
