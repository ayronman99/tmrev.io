        >Previously unseen footage, seeing and hearing the champions interviewed
        and talking to each other at a private dinner party hosted by baseball’s
        legendary great, Reggie Jackson. Ali, Frazier, Foreman, Holmes, Norton.
        For more than twenty years, these kings of boxing ruled the ring as they
        passed the world heavyweight title from one to the other. Now for the
        first time, see them all come face to face – gloves off – in an
        unprecedented video event. Footage from over 30 fights, which include 15
        title matches, featuring interviews and news events as they occurred
        during each champion’s reign.</image:caption
