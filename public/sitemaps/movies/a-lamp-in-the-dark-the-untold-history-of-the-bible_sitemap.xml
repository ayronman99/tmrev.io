        >A Lamp in the Dark is an exciting new documentary that unfolds the
        fascinating “untold” history of the Bible, revealing critical
        information often overlooked in modern histories. Throughout the Middle
        Ages, the Papal Inquisition forbade biblical translation, threatening
        imprisonment and death to those who disobeyed. Learn the stories of
        valiant warriors of the faith, such as John Wycliffe, William Tyndale,
        Martin Luther, the ancient Waldenses, Albigenses and others who hazarded
        their lives for the sake of sharing the Gospel light with a world
        drowning in darkness. Once the common people were able to read the
        Bible, the world was turned upside down through the Protestant
        Reformation.</image:caption
