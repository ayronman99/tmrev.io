        >Siddu is the son of an over-protective business man. Every decision of
        his is made by his father, which leads him into frustration. He
        half-heartedly agrees to become engaged to a rich man's daughter, but
        then falls for a middle-class man's daughter called Hasini. The film
        focuses on his realization that he has to stand on his own and come out
        of his father's protective shell- and try to succeed in
        love.</image:caption
