        >Driving Equality Across America is the product of a 107-day,
        22,000-mile trek through most of the lower 48 states in an effort to
        meet, interview, and share the stories of LGBT Americans, their allies,
        and their opponents. This film follows the filmmaker's trip across the
        country as he meets LGBT Americans where they live, in small towns and
        big cities. Through touching interviews, some heartbreaking, others
        inspiring, Driving Equality Across America offers a glimpse of the
        filmmaker's journey into the heart of LGBT America.</image:caption
