        >Laida Magtalas is a modern-day Belle who works hard to provide for her
        family while hoping that someday she will meet her prince charming and
        that they will live happily ever after together. That would-be prince
        charming is none other than "Miggy", the youngest member of the
        Montenegro clan — a well established family in the business world. Moony
        Laida's desire to finally meet Miggy leads her to apply as an Editorial
        Assistant at his newly launched men’s magazine, "Bachelor". In spite of
        the fact that a relationship with Miggy may prove to be a long shot,
        Laida revels working in such close proximity with the man of her
        dreams.</image:caption
