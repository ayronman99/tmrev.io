        >Neverlution debuted at the Montreal Comedy festival in 2010 to standing
        ovations. In it, Titus talks about bringing the country back to its
        former glory, the new generation, and politics. Comedy Central Records
        released a double CD of Neverlution on June 28, 2011.The 105 minute
        Neverlution DVD was available for pre order on August 3, 2011 and
        shipped on August 15, 2011. In a change from his earlier deals with
        distribution companies Titus got the rights to his special and will only
        distribute it through his website christophertitus.com. Titus believes
        that the web will make it so that artists can make the most with their
        art and support their fans better and the special aired on Comedy
        Central on July 3, 2011</image:caption
