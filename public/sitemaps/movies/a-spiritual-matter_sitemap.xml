        >"A Spiritual Matter" is the first-ever adaptation of an Ingmar Bergman
        script since his passing. In this movie, Viktoria is a 40-year-old woman
        who seems to have gone mad and develops a compelling and moving
        monologue of moments that marked her existence. Viktoria (Sophie
        Marceau), a bishop's daughter and pastor's wife, talks to herself and
        reveals her intimate world: her joys and woes, her childhood and her
        relationship with her cheating and aloof husband. She voyages from life
        to life, seemingly playing several roles. She remembers, dreams,
        fantasizes and hallucinates, bringing back to life her late husband,
        mother, father and friends.</image:caption
