        >BROTHERS OF THE BLACK LIST tells the story behind the longest litigated
        civil rights case in American history. It all began in September 1992,
        when an elderly woman in Oneonta, New York reported that she had been
        attacked in an attempted rape by a young Black male who cut his hand
        during the altercation. This led to a college administrator at nearby
        SUNY Oneonta giving the police a list of the names and residences of the
        125 Black men who attended the school. Police used this list to track
        down every Black male in town, questioning them and demanding to see
        their hands.</image:caption
