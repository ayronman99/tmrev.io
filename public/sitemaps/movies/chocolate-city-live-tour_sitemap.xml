        >After their unprecedented win at the National Stripper Competition in
        Las Vegas the year before, the Chocolate City team of strippers have had
        some ups and downs. Michael, their lead dancer suffered a tragic loss
        when his mother unexpectedly passes. Their Reality show, after their
        Vegas win, experienced low viewership and was not what they had
        expected, forcing them to withdraw from the Network production
        altogether. Now its time to get back to what they do best - dance. With
        the help and support of Mr. Williams, the Chocolate City Dancers will
        now prepare for a multi-city tour to regain their mojo, but once again
        personal challenges and internal beefs threaten to derail their new
        plan.</image:caption
