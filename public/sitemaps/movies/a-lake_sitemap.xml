        >The action unfolds in a country about which we know nothing, a land of
        snow and forests, somewhere in the North. A family lives in an isolated
        house near a lake. Alexi, a young, pure-hearted man, is a woodcutter.
        Occasionally suffering from epileptic seizures and overcome by an
        ecstatic state, he is one with the nature around him. Alexi is very
        close to his younger sister, Hege. Their blind mother, father, and
        younger brother, silently observe this uncontrollable love. One day a
        stranger arrives, a young man slightly older than Alexi.</image:caption
