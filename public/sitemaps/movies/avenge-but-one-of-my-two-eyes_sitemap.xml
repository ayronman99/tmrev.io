        >Shot in the Occupied Territories by Israeli director Avi Mograbi, this
        controversial documentary film draws parallels between the Israeli -
        Palestinian situation today and the enduring myths of Samson and Masada.
        Mograbi offers a powerful, at times chilling, lament of the continuing
        cycles of violence rooted in the past and threatening to engulf
        everyone's future. With the roots of so much real-world conflict left
        unexamined by today's restless media, this film reminds us just how
        vital filmmakers like Avi Mograbi are. Documentary today is rarely
        immersed in questions of this magnitude - or tackles them with the level
        of eloquence shown here by Mograbi. An exceptional and challenging
        film.</image:caption
