        >Adapted freely from the classic novella 'The Mysterious Stranger' by
        Mark Twain; Day of the Stranger revives the tradition of the acid
        western of the 1970's. Caine Farrowood is a bounty hunter who works
        under the control of ruthless kingpin Loomweather. One day a bounty
        retrieval goes awry and Caine is left for dead. Just when he thinks his
        life is over he mysteriously awakens back home to the comforts of his
        wife Christina. Baffled and confused by how he got home Caine insists on
        finding answers, but before long he is enlisted in the retrieval of
        another bounty. This one is huge and may cost Caine not his life, but
        his sanity when he finds himself pitted against somebody who may very
        well be the fallen angel himself.</image:caption
