        >Lake, a young theater actor with no respect for the elderly, is forced
        to make himself look old, in order to land a part in a Broadway-bound
        play. His ego drives his girlfriend away, and when research for the play
        requires him to spend a week in a nursing home, he is forced to review
        his life choices. Lake eventually learns to abandon his preconceptions
        and rid himself of the anger that has been holding him back, in pursuit
        of his dreams.</image:caption
