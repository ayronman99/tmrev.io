        >A small Indian village: an old man is addicted to watching pornography
        with his friends. One fine day, he accidentally brings home a DVD with a
        Godard film inside it. Though his friends were disgusted, Ananda gets
        attracted to Godard’s film and gradually develops an obsession. He
        initiates the idea of hosting a film festival in their village where
        Godard’s films will be screened. The festival gets organized after a lot
        of drama, but what happens next is to be seen.</image:caption
