        >A young mother, Rachel, frantically searches for her teen daughter,
        Hannah after their car crashed outside of a small town in the middle of
        nowhere and her daughter goes missing. People die mysteriously in
        Rachelâ€™s wake as she gets closer to finding out that the small-town
        doctor kidnapped her daughter. He and his wife never got over the tragic
        loss of their teen daughter and it turns out that Hannah is the perfect
        surrogate to take her place. Rachel desperately needs to find and rescue
        her daughter before she is forced to play this role for the rest of her
        life</image:caption
