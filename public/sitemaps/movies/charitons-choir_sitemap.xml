        >Chariton Ulianov has one great love: Life! That particular love affair
        however does not hamper him in his pursuit of enjoyment of her simpler
        pleasures. For him every woman is beautiful, every wine is superior when
        shared with good company and every situation an opportunity for good
        humor. His position as School Master in a small provincial town on the
        island of Corfu gives him the opportunity to disseminate his own unique
        philosophy especially to the students that participate in his greatest
        passion: the choir.</image:caption
