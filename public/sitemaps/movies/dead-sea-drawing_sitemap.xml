        >This work is part of a project called Lot’s wife (La Femme de Loth),
        which refers to a passage in the Book of Genesis in which the patriarch,
        Lot, and his family run away from Sodom and Gomorrah during the
        destruction of the two cities. Disobeying the Angel’s command not to
        look back, Lot’s wife turns into a salt statue. For this project the
        artist has made a series of drawings where the salt creates hollows in
        the paper, distorts it, damages it and in doing so, creates forms and
        designs.</image:caption
