        >This is a story about returning to ones ancestral homeland. Anna is a
        cardiologist who discovers her father has fled to his native Armenia
        after being diagnosed with a heart problem. Despite their contentious
        relationship, she sets out to bring her father back for this operation.
        Anna is a tough-minded, headstrong woman with little feeling for her
        fathers homeland or patience with its politics and socially intrusive
        culture, yet she finds this journey not only a reunion of sorts, but one
        of reconciliation as well.</image:caption
