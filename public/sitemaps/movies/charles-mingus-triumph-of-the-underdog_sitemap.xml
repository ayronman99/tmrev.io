        >Don McGlynn's uncompromising and soulful documentary look at the
        tumultuous life of musician and rebel Charles Mingus is fascinating
        stuff. Mingus said of himself "I am half black man, half yellow man, but
        I claim to be a Negro. I am Charles Mingus, the famed jazz musician--but
        not famed enough to make a living in America." His statement summed up
        the conflict that plagued this musical genius his entire life:
        volatility, pain, prescience, and raw rage roiled inside a complex man,
        composer, bass player, and trombonist who transcended labels and refused
        to be pigeonholed into a single musical style--and who did not achieve
        real fame until late in his career.</image:caption
