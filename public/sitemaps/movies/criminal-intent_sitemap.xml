        >Devon Major thought that his share of difficulties were over. Having
        gone through a difficult divorce with his wife he was now on the way to
        rebuilding his life when tragedy strikes leaving him in a fight for his
        freedom and his innocence. Devons' beautiful ex-wife is found viciously
        murdered, and all evidence points to Devon. In desperation Devon turns
        to Susan Grace the lawyer who represented his ex-wife during their
        divorce. Although initially reluctant and unconvinced of Devon's
        innocence Susan finds herself agreeing to take on the case and finds
        that the path to justice can often lead to betrayal, deception and
        murder.</image:caption
