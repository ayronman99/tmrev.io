        >The ‘Casa do Povo’ cultural centre in São Paulo, an icon of the secular
        Jewish workers’ movement: a crumbling theatre flanked by staircases,
        entryways and corridors. Construction noise drones away in the
        background, clinking crockery, a broom sweeping over tiled floors, an
        expressive façade of countless adjustable panes of glass covered by a
        patina. It’s October 2016 and a group of young people are preparing a
        preview of Bickels [Socialism]. The venue is to form a prologue to the
        completed film, which tours 22 buildings in Israel designed by Samuel
        Bickels, most of which for kibbutzim. Dining halls, children’s houses,
        agricultural buildings, bright structures inserted into the
        Mediterranean landscape with great ingenuity. An architecture with a
        sell-by date: That many are now empty or have been repurposed at best is
        linked to the decline of the socialist ideals they
        embody.</image:caption
