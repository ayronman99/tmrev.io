        >When he's called in to investigate the murder of a former art student
        (Pooja Kanwal), Nilesh Bhargav (Rajit Kapoor) turns to the woman's
        paintings to see if they might hold clues to her killer's identity. Was
        it (Aham Sharma) the boyfriend she abandoned years ago and whom the
        police suspect? Or was there another with the motive, means and
