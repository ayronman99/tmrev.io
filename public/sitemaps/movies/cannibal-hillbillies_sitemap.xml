        >Debbie D, Dean Paul, and Laura Giglio star in this hilarious black
        comedy about a none too bright hillbilly brother and sister (Dean and
        Laura) who come across an innocent victim (Debbie D) asking for
        directions after getting lost in the woods. Little does the woman know
        that the pair are hungry cannibals out for their next meal! After a
        desperate attempt to escape, the woman is caught and brought back to the
        pair's basement where she's shown what will happen to her. Escaping once
        again, the woman runs through the forest dressed only in her panties,
        only to be caught once again and carried completely naked back to her
        fate.</image:caption
