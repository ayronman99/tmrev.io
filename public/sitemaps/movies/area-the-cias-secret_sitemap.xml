        >This true story covers ground-breaking research into the aviation that
        took place at the Groom Lake Testing Facility, otherwise known as Area
        51, which ensured US Aerial supremacy from the Cold War through to the
        present day. Utilising CIA documents that have recently been
        declassified this programme identifies specific individuals who worked
        at the top secret base in a variety of roles – the radar specialists,
        pilots and security guards. Their personal testimonies provide a unique
        impression not just of the work that was carried out, but of the site
        itself. We reveal just how tight security had to be to keep the
        development of the U2, A12 and HAVE BLUE aviation programmes under
        wraps. This is a film that concentrates on delivering history and
        factual accuracy in a fresh and engaging style – one that answers the
        question ‘what really happened at Area 51’?</image:caption
