        >180 kilometers down wind of Chernobyl, the village of Budische was
        evacuated except for 55 older residents who refused to leave and one
        young man, Alexei who wanted to stay with his parents. This is a simple
        story of life in Budische 14 years later, as told in voiceover by
        Alexei. The Belarus village is built around a common spring from which
        everyone draws water, toting it back to their homes, and to which the
        women walk to do their laundry outside.</image:caption
