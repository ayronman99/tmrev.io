        >There are many things in life that could do a number on a man's
        masculinity. Lenny Babbitt has his identity and manhood challenged when
        his wife Tracy leaves him for a female doctor named Iris who has been
        treating their autistic son Isaac. After losing his job, and wife to a
        woman no less -- Lenny's dad Jack offers him a job at his pawn shop
        where he must re-examine his identity, manhood and sense of self after
        meeting Chelsea, a young, free-spirited pistol that lives life on two
        wheels. In the end, Lenny realizes that there are no absolutes... only
        one's faith, sense of self and family -- no matter how it's constituted
        or defined by society.</image:caption
