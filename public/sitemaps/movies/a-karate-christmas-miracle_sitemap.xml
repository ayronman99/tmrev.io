        >After his father disappeared during a mass shooting on Christmas Day
        one year earlier, 10-year-old, precocious Jesse Genesis creates a "12
        Days of Christmas List" of tasks. If he completes them all, including
        teaching himself to become a karate black belt, he believes his father
        will return on Christmas. Jesse's sophisticated, workaholic mother,
        Abby, believes her husband was lost in the shooting, but has a glimmer
        of hope through visions that Jesse reports to her. After Abby enlists
        the aid of an eccentric psychic-turned-law professor, a roller coaster
        thriller ensues, where the trio unravel a mystery that no one expected -
        and maybe, just maybe witness the delivery of a miracle that can only
        happen on Christmas.</image:caption
