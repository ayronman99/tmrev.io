        >To get to know the world he lives in, college kid Andrew Jenks doesn't
        take off to remote, exotic places with a backpack, but instead decides
        to go and stay in a retirement home in Florida for a few weeks. There,
        he gets acquainted with Tammy, Libby, Dotty and Bill, all of whom are
        past their prime. These few weeks turn into a valuable experience for
        Jenks, who approaches the elderly people with an open mind and takes a
        close look at the less cheerful sides of old age, including decay and
        dependence.</image:caption
