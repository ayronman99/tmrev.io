        >In 2014, Sergeant First Class Stephen Harris edited and uploaded this
        film. It was his message to the world. A group of teenagers are sent an
        unlabeled DVD from a U.S. Army base in Afghanistan containing a video of
        a strange woman tied to a tree. It ends with a clue. The teens follow
        the clue to another and yet another, until what started out as a game
        becomes a terrifying chase into the psychopathic mind of Harris. At the
        end of the line, the teens' world comes full circle as they discover
        they weren't just playing a game, they were pawns in a revenge plot only
        a master of war could devise.</image:caption
