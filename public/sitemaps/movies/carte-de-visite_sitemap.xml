        >Drifting clouds. They are not nice little clouds that invite us to
        interpret them symbolically; rather they are poisonous and unhealthy
        clusters, a skin rash of the sky, an impenetrable gray curtain of smog.
        This is a trailer of impressive tranquility and simplicity. A second
        look, however, opens up new dimensions: Are there not – as so often the
        case in Gehr’s work – unsuspected, amorphous forms that manifest
        themselves? Has an event scurried quickly past us while we were still
        busy discovering the mysterious in the seemingly obvious? In fact, these
        are two trailers in one: a palimpsest of the cinematographic pleasure of
        mystification.</image:caption
