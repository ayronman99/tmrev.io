        >You're not hallucinating (but they are)... It's the legendary toker
        jokers Cheech & Chong as you've never seen them before -- in their very
        first Animated Movie. Catch the buzz as their most outrageous routines
        and laugh-out-loud lines from their Grammy Award-winning albums come to
        life, including "Dave's not here," "Let's make a dope deal" and more.
        With help from a bud-lovin' body crab named Buster, Cheech & Chong "the
        masters of smokin' word" deliver the ultimate comedy high and give you
        the munchies for more.</image:caption
