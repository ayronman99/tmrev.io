        >Charlie Murphy: I Will Not Apologize is a live stand-up performance by
        Murphy in Boston. During his 1-hour set, Charlie covers a spectrum of
        topics, such as a discussing the male ego as well as a politically
        incorrect bit about people, including a certain former president of the
        United States, that he believes are "functionally retarded." He also
        does an amusing re-enactment of some scenes from 300. Murphy goes on to
        criticize the usual rehabilitation treatments ensuing from celebrity
        meltdowns (e.g., Mel Gibson and Michael Richards), arguing that an
        experience with Jigsaw from Saw is the only way to cure these people of
        their prejudices. Sticking with celebrities, he claims that Britney
        Spears's strange behaviour in 2007-08 was caused by her being possessed
        by the spirit of Rick James. In addition, Charlie hits on reality
        television, making fun of the courage (or lack thereof) of Dog the
        Bounty Hunter as well as an obsession with The Dog
        Whisperer.</image:caption
