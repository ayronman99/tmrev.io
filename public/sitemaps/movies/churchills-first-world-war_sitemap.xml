        >Drama-documentary about Winston Churchill's extraordinary experiences
        during the Great War, with intimate letters to his wife Clementine
        allowing the story to be told largely in his own words. Just 39 and at
        the peak of his powers running the Royal Navy, Churchill in 1914 dreamt
        of Napoleonic glory, but suffered a catastrophic fall into disgrace and
        humiliation over the Dardanelles disaster. The film follows his road to
        redemption, beginning in the trenches of Flanders in 1916, revealing how
        he became the 'godfather' of the tank and his forgotten contribution to
        final victory in 1918 as Minister of Munitions. Dark political intrigue,
        a passionate love story and remarkable military adventures on land, sea
        and air combine to show how the Churchill of 1940 was shaped and forged
        by his experience of the First World War.</image:caption
