        >Why is it that Billy Bob Thornton, Dave Matthews, Peter Buck, Derek
        Trucks, Phish, Widespread Panic, and Blues Traveler are all huge fans of
        Colonel Bruce Hampton, but you've never heard of him? Bruce began his
        career with an unprecedented six figure record deal in 1970. The Hampton
        Grease Band's first album went on to be the worst selling album in the
        history of Columbia Records. He made a brave decision and continued his
        musical career, devoting himself to creating pure art rather than
        attempt any commercial success. The result has been an amazing,
        influential 50 year catalog of music and philosophy. Dubbed the father
        of the Jam Band music scene, he is a guru to many a celeb. Why is he
        still a secret?</image:caption
