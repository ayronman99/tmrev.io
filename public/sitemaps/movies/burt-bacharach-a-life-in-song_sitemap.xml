        >On February 26 2016, Eagle Rock Entertainment released A Life In Song -
        a concert film celebrating the life and career of Burt Bacharach,
        featuring performances by Joss Stone, Justin Hayward, Alfie Boe, Sophie
        Ellis-Bextor, Shaun Escoffery, Rebecca Ferguson, Michael Kiwanuka, and
        Laura Mvula. This recording was produced and recorded by BBC Events
        Production. Filmed at London's Royal Festival Hall in 2015, A Life In
        Song presents on-stage conversations between Burt Bacharach and Michael
        Grade traversing different aspects of his years in music, interspersed
        with performances of many of his best loved songs by a diverse cast of
        artists. The evening culminates in a medley of some of Bacharach's most
        famous film songs performed by the man himself and his band, and a
        performance of "That's What Friends Are For" featuring the entire
        evening's cast.</image:caption
