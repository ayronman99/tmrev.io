        >Cancer is the only disease that has been defeated dozens of times
        without anyone knowing it. In the last 100 years, doctors, scientists,
        and researchers have developed diverse and effective solutions against
        cancer only to be thwarted by the political and propaganda power of the
        drug-dominated medical profession. This is the story of Essiac, Hoxsey,
        Laetrile, Shark Cartilage, Mistletoe, and Bicarbonate of Soda all put
        together in a stunning overview that leaves no doubt that inexpensive
        cures for cancer do exist but are systematically blocked by Big Pharma
        because they come from nature and cannot be patented. Highly
        informative.</image:caption
