        >Found at a Catholic hospital filthy and ferocious, feral teenager
        Darlin’ is whisked off to a care home run by The Bishop and his obedient
        nuns, where she’s to be rehabilitated into a "good girl" as an example
        of the miraculous work of the church. But Darlin’ holds a secret darker
        than the "sins" she is threatened with, and she is not traveling alone.
        The Woman who raised her, equally fierce and feral, is ever present in
        the shadows of Darlin’s psyche and is determined to come for her no
        matter who tries to get in her way.</image:caption
