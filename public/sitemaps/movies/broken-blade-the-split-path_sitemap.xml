        >Second Break Blade movie. The narration begins by revealing Athens
        invaded the Krisna Kingdom for allowing the Orlando Empire to cross into
        their land to attack Athens during their power struggle over Assam but
        the true purpose of the invasion is to take over the Krisna Quartz mines
        as Athens is suffering a shortage of Quartz. In the Athens capital of
        Ilios, Secretary of War Loquis has received news that his brother Zess
        has successfully reach Binonten. Meanwhile, Rygart manages to get a
        ceasefire between the Athens invaders and Krisna defenders and speaks
