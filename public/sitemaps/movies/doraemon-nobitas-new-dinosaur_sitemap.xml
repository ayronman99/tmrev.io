        dinosaur fossil exhibition site that he had visited before. He returned
        it to its original state with the "Time blanket". After hatching, the
        egg hatches a new species of dinosaur that is not named in the Cosmic
        Encyclopedia and names them Kyu and Myu Although they want to take care
        of them secretly, there are dinosaurs in the city still discovered by
        residents; Nobita and his friends were forced to bring them back to the
        Cretaceous period 66 million years ago the dinosaurs time. Just the time
