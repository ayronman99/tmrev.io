        >Audubon: Naturalist and 19th century painter, John James Audubon was
        one of the most remarkable men of early America. A contemporary of Lewis
        & Clark and Davey Crockett, he explored the American frontier in search
        of ""the feathered tribes"" he loved and studied. A self-taught artist
        and ornithologist, he left a legacy of art and science that made him
        famous in his lifetime and endures to this day. His portrait hangs in
        the White House, his statue stands over the entrance to the American
        Museum of Natural History, and his name was adopted by the nation's
        first conservation organization. The program, filmed in locations where
        Audubon painted, brings to life his timeless paintings with dazzling
        footage of the living birds he immortalized - and celebrates visually
        the natural world he described in his writings. Interviews reveal the
        man, explore his art, and put his groundbreaking work in modern
        perspective.</image:caption
