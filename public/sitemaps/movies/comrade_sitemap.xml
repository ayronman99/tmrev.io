        >After discovering that his father has lied to him for years about his
        estranged sister and his mother, 14-year-old Ilan runs away from home
        and ends up living with his sister, Dalia, who works on a cruise ship
        and is having an affair with a married man. While Dalia is at work, Ilan
        explores her down-and-out neighborhood and discovers and befriends
        Avram, an elderly holdout Communist living in an abandoned building with
        his weapons cache and marijuana-growing business, biding his time for
        the ultimate battle against the capitalists.</image:caption
