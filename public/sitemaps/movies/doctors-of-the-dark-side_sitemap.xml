        >Doctors of the Dark Side is the first feature length documentary about
        the pivotal role of physicians and psychologists in detainee torture.
        The stories of four detainees and the doctors involved in their abuse
        demonstrate how US Army and CIA doctors implemented the Enhanced
        Interrogation Techniques and covered up signs of torture at Guantanamo
        and Abu Ghraib. Interviews with medical, legal and intelligence experts
        and evidence from declassified government memos document what has been
        called the greatest scandal in American medical ethics. Based on four
        years of research by Producer/Director Martha Davis, written by Oscar
        winning Mark Jonathan Harris, and filmed in HD by Emmy winning DP Lisa
        Rinzler, the film shows how the torture of detainees could not continue
        without the assistance of the doctors.</image:caption
