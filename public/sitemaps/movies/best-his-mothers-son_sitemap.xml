        >Best – His Mother’s Son (BBC Two) was a gloomy drama about Ann Best,
        mother of George, who was strictly teetotal until her mid-40s, when she
        had her first sip of sherry to celebrate her son’s footballing success.
        Ten years later, she was dead from alcoholism-related heart disease. The
        recreation of late-Sixties Belfast was accurate and, thank goodness,
        intelligently subdued: no comedy Ulster accents and no point-scoring
        subplot about the Troubles.</image:caption
