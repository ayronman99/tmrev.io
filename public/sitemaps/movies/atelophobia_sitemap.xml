        >Meredith is a girl who so desperately tries to fit in with the
        beautiful people. A group of beauty pageant girls that have been friends
        since they were kids. When her attempts fail, and the bullying laps over
        into adulthood from these girls, Meredith snaps and begins a terrifying
        life or death game with the girls who treated her so horribly. They must
        either kill themselves, or live their lives with some sort of
        "imperfection".</image:caption
