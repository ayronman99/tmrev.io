        >A 72-year-old grandmother dies and finds herself on a ferry which will
        take her across the river to the hereafter. On the ferryboat she meets
        her first love, who was killed in a road accident in which they were
        both involved when they were young. She is presented with a fateful
        choice: to start life afresh as a 22-year- old - her age at the time of
        the accident - and to relinquish all her memories of the life she has
        lived; or to remain a 72-year-old woman with all her life's memories
        intact.</image:caption
