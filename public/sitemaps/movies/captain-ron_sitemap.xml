        >When mild-mannered Martin Harvey finds out that he has inherited a
        vintage yacht, he decides to take his family on a Caribbean vacation to
        retrieve the vessel. Upon arriving on a small island and realizing that
        the ship is in rough shape, Martin and his family end up with more than
        they bargained for as the roguish Captain Ron signs on to sail the boat
        to Miami. It doesn't take long before Ron's anything-goes antics get the
        Harveys into plenty of trouble.</image:caption
