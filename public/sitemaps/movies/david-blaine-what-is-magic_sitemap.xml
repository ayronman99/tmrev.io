        >David Blaine travels around America to perform tricks in the UK
        premiere of his show What Is Magic? He visits New Orleans where he
        carries out a money trick in front of locals, producing hundreds of
        dollars at their fingertips before stopping off at New York to conduct
        magic in front of Orlando Bloom. But the jewel in David's crown is his
        shot at the infamous The Bullet Catch; a trick which sees a 22 calibre
        bullet being fired at point blank range directly at the magician who
        then has to catch the bullet in a small metal cup in his mouth. The
        stunt is filmed using Phantom Camera technology which shoots 10,000
        frames per second so that not a fraction of the action is
        missed.</image:caption
