        >A rivalry between two actors proves to have dangerous consequences in
        this drama from Spain. Daniel (Federico Luppi) is the star of a popular
        television series who is interested in more prestigious work. and longs
        to appear on the legitimate stage. Daniel is lobbying for the leading
        role in Divertimento, a well-known play that made a star of leading man
        Bernardo Gabler (Francisco Rabal). When Daniel pays a visit to the
        theater where the play is being staged, he discovers to his surprise
        that Bernardo is waiting for him. Bernardo is not at all eager to turn
        over his signature role to another actor and insists on putting Daniel
        through a punishing audition, which turns out to be the least of
        Daniel's problems when Bernardo forces him to help hide a corpse,
        implicating him in a murder Bernardo claims to have
        committed.</image:caption
