        >Cochin Hanifa plays the title role of CI Mahadevan, who goes to a
        village where a bomb blast in a school bus has created terror in the
        hearts of the villagers. He is being assisted by a bunch of policemen
        working in the local police station. These policemen are more concerned
        about their personal matters than the problems faced by the public. How
        Mahadevan unravels the mystery behind the blast with the help of these
        policemen is the crux of the story.</image:caption
