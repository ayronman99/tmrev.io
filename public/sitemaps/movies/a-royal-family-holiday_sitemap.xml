        >Royalty in name and mind only, the Royal family led by patriarch
        Leighton and matriarch Alfreda, kick-off the first film, Royal Family
        Thanksgiving, with a fake break-up ruse to lure their overly-busy
        children home for Thanksgiving. Surprises and challenges ensue,
        including drama with Alfreda's envious sister Mona Levi; the revelation
        of a deep, dark family secret involving Alfreda's former acquaintance
        Chivonne Price; and dealings with Leighton's super-loud, outspoken
        cousin Nelson Royal. Unfortunately, Leighton and Alfreda both play their
        roles too well as old wounds are re-opened and their carefully planned
        reunion leads to chaos - and a potentially real break-up.</image:caption
