        >A documentary that portrays the famous Czech composer as a man of
        strong character, sensitivity, education and Christian faith, as a
        patriot and a man whose talent took him from a very modest family
        background to the highest peak of fame. How was it that a musician
        unknown until the age of 33 became adored all over Europe, was invited
        to the USA to help create a national American music, was awarded
        doctorates and honorary memberships from top international orchestras?
        Where did Dvořák draw the strength from to preserve his own identity and
        not succumb to contemporary fashion?</image:caption
