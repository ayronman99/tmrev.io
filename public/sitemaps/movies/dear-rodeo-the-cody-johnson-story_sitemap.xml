        >Dear Rodeo: The Cody Johnson Story, a brand-new cinematic
        feature-length documentary, is the much bigger picture, recounting
        Johnson’s real-life journey from the dusty rodeo arenas of rural Texas
        to some of the biggest musical stages in America. Every emotion Johnson
        felt over the past 20 years – whether he was standing in the back of the
        chute at the rodeo or singing about it in front of 75,000 fans – is
        captured vividly in this big screen experience, with all the highs and
        lows that come from the dreams you cling to and the dreams you
        ultimately let go of. Featuring interviews with Reba McEntire, Taya Kyle
        (the widow of “American Sniper” Chris Kyle), and more, this evocative
        and celebratory film is a love letter to everyone who has had to abandon
        a dream in order to find true purpose.</image:caption
