        Three years of uneasy have passed since the Four Nations Alliance
        declared war on the Abh Empire. With both sides decimated by the first
        encounter, the lull in violence has provided enough time to build fleets
        massive enough to span the entire galaxy. Just before the Abh complete
        preparations for their conquest, however, the Alliance launches a
        pre-emptive strike, forcing them to take the defensive. Now in command
        of her own ship, Lafiel is assigned to the fleet as a destroyer captain,
        and eagerly awaits the opportunity to prove herself as a true Abriel.
        But when a new class of enemy ship appears on the front lines, the tides
        quickly turn for the worse. With her vessel now little more than cannon
        fodder, her dreams are turned into a desperate race for survival - can
        she and her crew survive amidst a battlefield of endless death and
        destruction?</image:caption
