        >When an evil land baron's limo falls into a sinkhole outside Possum
        Lodge, lodge leader Red Green is ordered to pay the baron $10,000 or
        lose his beloved lodge forever. Red considers various money-making
        schemes concocted by his buddies, but it's his nerdy nephew Harold who
        hits on an idea that just might save their wood-smoked bacon: a
        duct-tape sculpture contest in Minneapolis that offers a $10,000
        third-place prize.</image:caption
