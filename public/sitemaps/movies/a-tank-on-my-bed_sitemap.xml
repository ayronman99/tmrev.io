        >Kostas is a law-abiding citizen, a quite man living with his mother,
        his sister Kaiti and his younger brother, Giorgos, who is a student. He
        works day and night at his kiosk, living to his bone the everyday
        reality and troubles of the period. He is in love with Eleni and wants
        to marry her, but he has to wait until Kaiti is married to Leonidas, her
        extremely conservative fiancé. The military coup of April 1967 forces
        Kostas to take the side of the winners, hanging, each time, the picture
        of their most powerful leader, while Giorgos joins a resistance group
        that sets up bombs. Giorgos’ actions puts Kostas in big
        trouble.</image:caption
