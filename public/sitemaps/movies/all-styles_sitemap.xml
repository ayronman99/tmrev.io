        >Struggling In his freshman year of college, Brandon tries to focus
        intently on his studies but keeps coming to the same conclusion: dance
        is his passion. His geeky roommate Nate proposes they start a dance
        crew, but their search for other freestyle dancers proves fruitless. So
        they expand their search across town, finding a break-dancer, a
        performance artist, a Bhangra dancer, an animator, a ballerina, and a
        ballroom dance mom willing to join the new crew. A national dance battle
        headlined by Brandon's previous crew, Levelz, provides the first
        opportunity for Brandon to prove to himself and his family that he and
        his crew have what it takes to make it as dancers.</image:caption
