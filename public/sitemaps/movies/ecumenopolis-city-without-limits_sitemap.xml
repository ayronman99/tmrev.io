        >Ecumenopolis: City Without Limits" tells the story of Istanbul and
        other Mega-Cities on a neo-liberal course to destruction. It follows the
        story of a migrant family from the demolition of their neighborhood to
        their on-going struggle for housing rights. The film takes a look at the
        city on a macro level and through the eyes of experts, going from the
        tops of mushrooming skyscrapers to the depths of the railway tunnel
        under the Bosphorous strait; from the historic neighborhoods in the
        south to the forests in the north; from isolated islands of poverty to
        the villas of the rich. It's an Istanbul going from 15 million to 30
        million. It's an Istanbul going from 2 million cars to 8 million. It's
        the Istanbul of the future that will soon engulf the entire region. It's
        an Istanbul nobody has ever seen before.</image:caption
