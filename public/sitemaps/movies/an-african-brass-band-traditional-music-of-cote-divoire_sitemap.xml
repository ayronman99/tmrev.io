        >At the beginning of the 20th century in Jacqueville, near Abidjan in
        the CÃ´te d'Ivoire, traditional music was forbidden by the missionaries.
        But the inhabitants' enjoyment of their local festivals proved stronger,
        and the little town developed its own brass band. This is the story of
        that brass band, a brass band that isn't at all like a military band.
        It's a dancing brass band, an African brass band, that accompanies all
        the big and little moments of life: national festivals, religious
        ceremonies, funerals, fetes and celebrations, a musical game involving a
        football, tunes from the famous Mapuka dance, or the experimental use of
        sacred drums together with the brass band. A lively debate between the
        musicians, in which a sense of humor is clearly present, as they examine
        fundamental questions about their tradition and its transformations in
        the context of the life of people today.</image:caption
