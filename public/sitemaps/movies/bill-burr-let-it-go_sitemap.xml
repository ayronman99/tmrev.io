        >It’s always been a dream of mine to do a show at the Fillmore. The name
        itself is synonymous with legendary performances. Countless iconic
        musicians and comedians have been on that stage. To be a part of that
        history was something I’ll never forget. As much as I was trying to keep
        my head together before the show, I couldn’t help but feel like a
        tourist or just some random dude who won a contest. LET IT GO represents
        the culmination of material I developed on the road from 2008-2009. As
        always thanks to everyone who came out to my shows, laughed at the funny
        stuff and stared during the bombing. I hope you enjoy it. – Bill
        Burr</image:caption
