        >David Thunder (Damian Chapa) is a young Native American man whose
        dreams have been haunted by evil since childhood, and when Julietta
        Asher (Natasha Blasick) enters his life, it seems as though that evil is
        about to manifest in the everyday world. Now, David must use the lessons
        passed down by his grandmother to combat the darkness and save not only
        his own life, but possibly that of Julietta -- and their unborn
        child.</image:caption
