        >Every World Series has its own distinct dramatic elements, but the Fall
        Classic in 2001 was inevitably marked by tragic events that took place
        away from the diamond. The terrorist attacks on America at first made
        sports seem insignificant. But thankfully, baseball served up a
        much-needed distraction, two perfectly matched teams in a ferocious
        seesaw battle that wasn't finished until the bottom of the ninth inning
        of the seventh game. This DVD does a fine job of showcasing the
        thrilling games in which the upstart Arizona Diamondbacks dethroned the
        New York Yankees, the perennial powerhouse that had won the World Series
        for three straight years. But the production also features commemorative
        ceremonies and interviews with New York City firefighters who attended
        some of the games. The Series was a true classic on the field and will
        always be recalled as the World Series that helped give America
        something else to think about.</image:caption
