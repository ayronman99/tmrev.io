        >A young woman, Chloe, living by her wits on the streets of New York
        City, has a chance meeting with a wise Inuit Eskimo, Theo, who was sent
        to New York by his elders to provide a message to the people of the
        world – We either change our destructive was or be destroyed by them.
        Chloe, who has been searching for something to believe in, becomes
        inspired by Theo and , with the help of a kind lawyer, Monica, the three
        of them present Theo’s story to the United Nations in hopes of creating
        a better future for all of us.</image:caption
