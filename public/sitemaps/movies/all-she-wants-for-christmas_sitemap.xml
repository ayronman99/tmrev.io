        >Forest City depends entirely on the Aikens Christmas decoration
        factory. Local economics graduate Judith 'Noelle' Dunn returned there to
        finish her thesis by analyzing the plant. A freak near-accident matches
        her with adventurous drifter Justin Allen, whom she gets a menial job in
        the factory. Alas the late founder discretely footed systematical
        losses. His haughty granddaughter Ashley Aikens arrives to check if the
        firm can be made profitable. Noelle is jealous when Ashley keeps
        contacting Justin, who swears only to have eyes for her. It turns out he
        is key to more secrets, but will they work for good or
        bad?</image:caption
