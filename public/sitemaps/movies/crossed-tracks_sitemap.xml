        >The successful novelist Judith Ralitzer is interrogated in the police
        station about the disappearance of her ghost-writer. A serial-killer
        escapes from a prison in Paris. A missing school teacher leaves his wife
        and children. In the road, the annoying and stressed hairdresser
        Hughette is left in a gas station by her fianc√© Paul while driving to
        the poor farm of her family in the country. A mysterious man offers a
        ride to her and she invites him to assume the identity of Paul during 24
        hours to not disappoint her mother. Who might be the unknown man and
        what is real and what is fiction?</image:caption
