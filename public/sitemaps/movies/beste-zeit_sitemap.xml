        >Kati drives the VW bus of her parents even without a license quite
        fast. But what else should one do in the Bavarian province? Kati and her
        best friend Jo keep asking themselves this question when they
        philosophize about God and the world with the tip in one hand and the
        beer in the other hand. After all, Kati's swarm Mike has just come back
        from the Bundeswehr, but while she dreams of the great love, he seems to
        take the matter far less seriously. And there's only stress with her
        dad.</image:caption
