        >Between 1964 and 1973 the United States conducted a secret air war,
        dropping over 2 million tons of bombs and making tiny Laos the most
        heavily bombed country in history. Millions of these 'cluster bombs' did
        not explode when dropped, leaving the country massively contaminated
        with 'bombies' as dangerous now as when they fell 30 years ago. Bombies
        examines the problem of unexploded cluster bombs through the personal
        experiences of a group of Laotians and foreigners and argues for their
        elimination as a weapon of war. Unfortunately they are still a standard
        part of the US arsenal and were dropped in Kosovo, Afghanistan and
        Iraq.</image:caption
