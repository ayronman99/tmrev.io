        >The exciting story of Sam, a broken man who after the world ends from a
        massive Meteor shower and the death of his son, is forced to survive
        underground. He and his trusted friend Troy along with a young female
        Rose, are thrust on a journey that takes them into the darkest parts of
        the underground world where they find themselves on the run with a crew
        of rag tag yet heavily armed rangers. Hunted down by mutated creatures,
        bandits and cannibals alike, their undeniable defiance to return home is
        challenged, and an honest story emerges to reveal the heart of
        friendship in the face of death. Broken Darkness is a tale of
        selflessness, friendship and courage.</image:caption
