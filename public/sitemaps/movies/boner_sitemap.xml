        >Jimmy Boner, a 20-something slacker living with his parents, is given
        an ultimatum by his wicked stepmother to find a job and move out within
        3 months after he accidentally walks in on her book club meeting wearing
        nothing but an iPod. Jimmy scrambles to find a job and lands an
        interview at a rundown, overworked accounting office where he meets
        Ivana, a recently-demoted corporate ice queen with whom Jimmy falls
        instantly in love. Through a miracle of fate, Jimmy gets the job despite
        having no marketable skills and puts his nose to the grindstone, working
        grueling hours and enduring Ivana's constant disappointment, in the
        hopes of impressing her and garnering her affections. Chaos, hilarity,
        and triumph ensue as Jimmy seeks to gain independence and find true
        love.</image:caption
