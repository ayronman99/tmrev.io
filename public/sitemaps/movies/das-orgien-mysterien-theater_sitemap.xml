        >Nitsch's work, which can be considered both ritualistic and
        existential, first drew attention in the early 1960s when he exhibited a
        skinned and mutilated lamb. The lamb was crucified against a white
        fabric-covered wall, with the entrails removed and displayed below a
        white table, splashed with blood and hot water. Currently his work is
        often discussed in the context of our cultures fixation with violence
        seen on the news, movie screens, and in popular video games.
        Correlations have also been drawn to many instances of the intersection
        of violence and culture. These performance works, which have become
        known as "actions" have become more and more elaborate over the
        years.</image:caption
