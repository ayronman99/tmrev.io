        >16-year-old Eveliina accidentally sees her mother kissing another
        woman. Fearing her parents' divorce, she decides to intervene, by any
        means and without permission. In her opinion, the best way to destroy
        her mother's extramarital affair and bring her parents back together is
        a teenage daughter in trouble. Thus, Eveliina gets herself in trouble as
        many ways as she can. Along the way, the lives of a few others are at
        stake. Still, Eveliina guards her plan to the last, and the adults have
        their own secret ways of survival - until the bubble
        bursts.</image:caption
