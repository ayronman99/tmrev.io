        >Having grown up within the Cuban Revolution, in 1980, Juan Carlos
        Zaldívar was a 13-year-old "pioneer" jeering in the streets at the
        thousands of "Marielitos" leaving the island by boat for the United
        States. Within weeks, he was a Marielito himself, headed with the rest
        of his family for a new life in Miami. Now a U.S.-based filmmaker,
        Zaldívar recounts the strange twist of fate that took him across one of
        the world's most treacherous stretches of water in 90 Miles, a new
        documentary having its broadcast premiere on PBS's acclaimed P.O.V.
        series in the summer of 2003. As related by Zaldívar in the intensely
        personal and evocative 90 Miles, arrival in South Florida is only the
        beginning of the family's struggles to comprehend the full meaning of
        their passage into exile. What follows is an intimate and uneasy
        accounting of the historical forces that have split the Cuban national
        family in two, and which shape the passage of values from one generation
        to the next.</image:caption
