        >After the Ball, a retail fairy tale set in the world of fashion. Kate's
        dream is to design for couturier houses. Although she is a bright new
        talent, Kate can't get a job. No one trusts the daughter of Lee Kassell,
        a retail guru who markets clothes "inspired" by the very designers Kate
        wants to work for. Who wants a spy among the sequins and stilettos?
        Reluctantly, Kate joins the family business where she must navigate
        around her duplicitous stepmother and two wicked stepsisters. But with
        the help of a prince of a guy in the shoe department her godmother's
        vintage clothes and a shocking switch of identities, Kate exposes the
        evil trio, saves her father's company -- and proves that everyone can
        wear a fabulous dress.</image:caption
