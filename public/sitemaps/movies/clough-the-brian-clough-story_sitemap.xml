        >30 years since his first European Cup success, 15 years since his
        retirement and 5 years after his death; Brian Clough continues to
        fascinate. The Afterlife of Brian continues a pace; best-selling book
        after best-selling book, a statue is unveiled in Nottingham city centre,
        and a feature film is released. "Clough" has intimate access with the
        family as Brian is forever remembered in bronze and exclusive
        behind-the-scenes footage of Nigel as he becomes the new manager of
        Derby County, on the night the wheel comes full circle and he takes over
        at the club his father walked out on 35 years ago.</image:caption
