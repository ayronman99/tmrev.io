        >An involving, beautifully modulated yarn about a young intellectual's
        "war" with two equines in a mountain village during the Cultural
        Revolution. A young student, Ma Jie, who is sent to a tiny Beigao
        village in Shanxi Province and has the mundane task of watching over
        livestock during the Great Cultural Revolution. Surrounded only by the
        extreme boredom, he initiates a war against two donkeys. What ensues as
        a result, is an impressive feature debut by director Li Dawei who
        manages to infuse a believable quirky and black humorous universe within
        a realistically grim setting.</image:caption
