        >When aspiring filmmaker Charlie receives a one-time offer from a
        controversial, once-prominent documentary filmmaker, he reluctantly
        agrees to return to the small town where he was raised to investigate
        the origins of a notorious serial killer who also grew up there. Once
        home, he must contend with agitated townsfolk, pressure from his crew,
        and the awkwardness of reconnecting with the townies who never
        left.</image:caption
