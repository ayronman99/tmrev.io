        >Kenny Wayne Shepherd's reverence for his musical roots are center-stage
        on Ten Days Out...Blues From The Backroads. The guitar-slinger is
        featured with the Double Trouble rhythm section of bassist Tommy Shannon
        and drummer Chris Layton performing with some of the greatest blues
        players of our time as well as lesser-known but historically significant
        bluesmen. Traveling to their hometowns to record everywhere from juke
        joints to front porches, from New Orleans to Kansas, Shepherd celebrates
        and becomes part of blues history with Ten Days Out...Blues From The
        Backroads.</image:caption
