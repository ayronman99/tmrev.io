        >Chulsoo is a punk kid who always plays tricks on others. One day, while
        he is picking on somebody as usual, he meets Younghee, a new transfer
        student, who becomes his class partner. He starts to like her. Younghee
        is a precocious smart girl who lives with her grandmother alone. Her
        grandmother owns a flower shop and she helps her grandma by delivering
        flowers. Though Younghee looks lively, she misses her deceased parents
        at heart.</image:caption
