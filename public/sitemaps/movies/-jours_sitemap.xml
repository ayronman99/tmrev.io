        >The director Jordan Feldman followed the French artist Xavier Veilhan
        for 256 days, on an almost daily basis. Shot from a deliberately
        lighthearted point of view this documentary, in which the camera is
        eventually forgotten, shows the life of a contemporary artist in his
        environment—emotional, relational, and professional. From projects’
        utopic beginnings to their realization determined by economic realities
        and institutional techniques, we follow Xavier Veilhan to the heart of
        the contemporary art world, from his studio to the gallery and the
        museum, in the company of all the protagonists who make up this milieu.
        In 90 minutes his journey takes us from Lyon to Bordeaux, where the
        artist is making public sculptures, and then to Paris for the
        preparations for the opening of his exhibition at the Centre Georges
        Pompidou.</image:caption
