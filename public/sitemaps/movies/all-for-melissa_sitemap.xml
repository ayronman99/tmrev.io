        >Set in Hawaii, All For Melissa is a touching, beautiful feature film
        that tells the story of a young man's coming to grips with the reality
        of his everyday life. It shows that even though you may not get the girl
        of your dreams, the movie star fantasy; sometimes the girl next door,
        your best friend, is better than any dream girl ever could be. What sets
        All For Melissa apart from other films of this genre is the role the
        landscape, culture, and spirit of the Hawaii plays in the film. This is
        a love letter to Hawaii, a big aloha, and mahalo to the land and the
        people of this state.</image:caption
