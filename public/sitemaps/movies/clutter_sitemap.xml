        >Charlie Bradford, an aspiring filmmaker in his 30s, is doing the best
        he can to distance himself from the chaos of his childhood home. But his
        eccentric mother Linda, a compulsive hoarder who suffers from depression
        punctuated by spells of manic consumption, has a tendency to keep the
        people and things she loves close at hand. Charlie's younger sisters
        still live at home with Linda: Lisa, the older of the two has a history
        of petty theft and works as a home healthcare aid, and Penny, who is
        trying to overcome her agonizing shyness is starting a a new career as a
        home stager in a beleaguered real estate market.</image:caption
