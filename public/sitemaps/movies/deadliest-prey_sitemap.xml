        >Sequel to Deadly Prey. Colonel Hogan is still alive and just getting
        out of prison on parole, some 28 years later. But he has only one thing
        in mind and that is revenge on Mike Danton. So once again, Hogan puts
        together a group of mercenaries, has Danton kidnapped, and the games
        begin. Only this time Hogan is funded by a huge internet company in
        exchange for broadcasting the hunting of Danton over the internet,
        worldwide. For Hogan, winning is everything. Proving that there can only
        be one best and that it is him. What he had not thought of is that he
        isnâ€™t the only one who had twenty eight years to get pissed off. Because
        now Mike Danton is pissed off and that means few will
        survive.</image:caption
