        >Jean-Marie Bigard plays Clérambard, a ruined squire, his family's
        slavery slave, cat taster, parish priest eater. Converted after an
        appearance of Saint Francis of Assisi, he becomes as violent in good as
        he was in evil. A tailor-made role! He no longer touches animals, even
        if they are insignificant, he finds purity in girls of joy, pleasure in
        destitution and he will preach this message on the roads, in a caravan,
        taking his family on its crusade of love .</image:caption
