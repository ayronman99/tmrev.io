        >Cinder knew her life was over when her father came home from a business
        trip with a new wife and her 2 daughters when she was only 6. When her
        father dies soon afterwards, she pretty much has to care for herself, as
        her stepmother whittles away her father's money and possessions. Cinder
        bides her time by hanging with her best friend Justin, working at the
        library with the unbearable Lenore, and crushing on Cash, the psycho who
        tends the lawn, until her 21st birthday, when she inherits the trust
        fund her father left for her. When she makes off with Justin's clay doll
        of the voodoo god Baron Samedi, the god visits her to help "make things
        happen" for her--including landing a night with Cash. Little did she
        know, however, that Cash was in cahoots with her step-mom to do away
        with her so they could get her trust fund money. Little did Cash and
        Step-mom know, that Baron Samedi was going to help Cinder get her
        revenge.</image:caption
