        >Sasha is a young Russian violinist on a scholarship to Juilliard,
        living with his affectionate but overbearing father, a cellist
        determined to manage his son's career. While Sasha prepares for a
        critical recital that will launch him on a path to a glittering future,

        York. When he meets Ramona, a bohemian singer/songwriter, he joins her
        band, and falls in love with her and her music. He begins to lead a
        double life, careening frantically between two worlds.</image:caption
