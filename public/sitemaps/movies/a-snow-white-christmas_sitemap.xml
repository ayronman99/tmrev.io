        >When Blanca Snow is faced with spending Christmas with her dastardly
        stepmother, Victoria, she attempts to fulfill her late father’s wishes
        and create new memories as a family. However, Victoria plots to edge
        Blanca out of her father's inheritance and keep the money and his
        mansion, for herself. Victoria has Blanca hypnotized, so she will forget
        everyone and everything about her father’s will. When Blanca wakes up in
        a quaint motor lodge out of town with severe amnesia, she receives the
        help of seven quirky friends, the Holly Jollies, to help her figure out
        her life. While attempting to regain her memory, she finds herself the
        object of affection to both house painter Hunter, and Lucas Prince. But,
        who can she trust?</image:caption
