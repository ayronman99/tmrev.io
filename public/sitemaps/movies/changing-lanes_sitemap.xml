        >A rush-hour fender-bender on New York City's crowded FDR Drive, under
        most circumstances, wouldn't set off a chain reaction that could
        decimate two people's lives. But on this day, at this time, a minor
        collision will turn two complete strangers into vicious adversaries.
        Their means of destroying each other might be different, but their
        goals, ultimately, will be the same: Each will systematically try to
        dismantle the other's life in a reckless effort to reclaim something he
        has lost.</image:caption
