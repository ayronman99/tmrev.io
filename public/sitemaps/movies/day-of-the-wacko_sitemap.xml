        >It is a bitter story about a middle-aged man, who hates his life and
        other people, including himself. Adam Miauczynski, the character known
        from director Marek Koterski's previous films, is a 44 year-old teacher,
        who reads poetry during school lessons and later goes home swearing and
        calling his neighbours' names. The worst pain for him is the next 5
        minutes of living. He doesn't accept himself and even everyday contacts
        with others cause his aggression. Though constantly dreaming of a
        romantic love, he is not bold enough to make his dreams come true. The
        desperate Miauczynski personalizes our own fears and obsessions, which
        have become so visible recently.</image:caption
