        >While emptying the Parisian apartment of her mother Kyoko, who has just
        died, Akiko discovers a pile of notebooks specifically left for her. The
        notebooks are her mother's personal diary, which she started writing in
        1964. Laden with the strange inheritance, Akiko decides to take her
        mother's urn back to Japan to her maternal family, and in the process
        discovers that she is herself part of an intimate area of her mother's
        life about which she new nothing. The film travels between two
        generations of women, from the France of the New Wave to Japan after the
        atomic bomb. While looking for the right place to disperse her mother's
        ashes, Akiko goes back in time and tries to find her own place. Akiko,
        the heroine of this documentary, refers to her mother the actress and
        her mother the feminine icon of the 1960s. The film is carried along by
        this dialog beyond death, just as it is by Kyoko's past and Akiko's
        destiny.</image:caption
