        >Sophia (Mariana Gi√≥) is a young and beautiful journalist who gets her
        first job, covering a story in Dubai, thanks to her boyfriend and boss
        at a publishing house. When she arrives, she meets her driver, Carim,
        who starts to introduce her to Arab customs, but she wastes no time in
        corrupting their professional relationship by subjecting Carim to her
        wildest sexual desires. That is how Sophia reconsiders her troubled
        relationship with her partner. She risks her dream job opportunity
        tempted by a clandestine love affair that has no future.</image:caption
