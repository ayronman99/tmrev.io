        >For almost 30 years, bookseller Jordan has lived and worked in a
        neighborhood in Berlin that has become a social hotbed. As Jordan
        witnesses a teenager brutally beating up an older man, he intervenes and
        files a complaint - with unimaginable consequences ... Director Dror
        Zahavi ("Everything for my father", "My life - Marcel Reich-Ranicki")
        succeeded after a screenplay by Jürgen Werner ("Tatort - With a steady
        hand", "Schimanski - layer in the pit", also with Götz George) an
        atmospherically tightly staged and outstandingly played portrait of a
        so-called problem district. Here nothing is glossed over, but instead
        the reality shown and the powerlessness of our judicial system
        mercilessly layed bare. A highlight of 2010!</image:caption
