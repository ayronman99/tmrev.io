        >Angdu is no ordinary boy. Indeed, in a past life he was a venerated
        Buddhist master. His village already treats him like a saint as a
        result. The village doctor, who has taken the boy under his wing,
        prepares him to be able to pass on his wisdom. Alas, Tibet, Angduâ€™s
        former homeland and the centre of his faith, lies far away from his
        current home in the highlands of Northern India. On top of that, the
        conflict between China and Tibet makes the prospect of a trip there even
        more daunting. Undeterred by these harsh facts, the duo set off for
        their destination on foot, accompanied by questions of friendship and
        the nature of life. With its narrative approach steeped in a serene
        sense of concentration, this documentary film, composed over a period of
        eight years, stands as a fundamental experience in its own
        right.</image:caption
