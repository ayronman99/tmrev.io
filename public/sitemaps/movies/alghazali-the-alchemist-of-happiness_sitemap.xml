        >Exploring the life and impact of the greatest spiritual and legal
        philosopher in Islamic history, this film examines Ghazali's existential
        crisis of faith that arose from his rejection of religious dogmatism,
        and reveals profound parallels with our own times. Ghazali became known
        as the Proof of Islam and his path of love and spiritual excellence
        overcame the pitfalls of the organised religion of his day. His path was
        largely abandoned by early 20th century Muslim reformers for the more
        strident and less tolerant school of Ibn Taymiyya. Combining drama with
        documentary, this film argues that Ghazali's Islam is the antidote for
        today's terror.</image:caption
