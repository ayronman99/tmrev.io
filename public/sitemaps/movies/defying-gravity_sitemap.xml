        >Cassandra, a mute runaway girl, takes refuge in the cemetery in which
        her mother is laid to rest. She is watched over by Jorge, the cemetery
        caretaker, an illegal alien who is committed to the restoration of a
        classic '60 cadillac hearse. Shore is a dynamic, handsome, and brilliant
        young man who also happens to be homeless. After almost hitting
        Cassandra in his dilapidated VW bus, he becomes fascinated by the gothic
        cemetery waif and attempts to befriend her. A sequence of events results
        in Cass getting lost. Jorge and Shore flee the cemetery in a stolen
        hearse to find Cassandra before her abusive step-father does. All paths
        lead to Yermo - the site of a roadside diner and a feisty but
        compassionate transvestite waitress named Lola.</image:caption
