        >A struggling chef living in a trendy New York borough, Jessica took
        over a small restaurant where she used to work as a waitress, but it’s
        growing tough to make ends meet. Prince Jack, who’s in the city for his
        family’s annual Christmas charity dinner, finds himself in need of a
        last-minute chef for the royal event when he meets Jessica. As their
        relationship evolves and a romance blooms, so do the obstacles. But as
        the event arrives, she decides to go through with the dinner, and may
        just get the best Christmas present of all… love.</image:caption
