        >At the height of her fame in 1954, actress Ava Gardner transplanted
        herself from Hollywood to the country of Spain. As she lovingly stated
        in her autobiography, “I don’t know if it was the climate, the men, or
        the music, but as soon as I set foot in Spain, I had a crush on this
        country.” In this documentary by Sergio Mondelo, the filmmaker explores
        the motivations behind this move and contrasts Gardner’s glitz and glam
        lifestyle with the hardships faced by the Spainish people under Franco’s
        rule.</image:caption
