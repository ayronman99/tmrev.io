        >When the lazy and careless Dino is fired, he calls his grandmother Dadi
        to claim his deceased parents' wealth. Dadi knowing Dino well tells him
        that he will only get the money once he is married. After being rejected
        by all his ex-girlfriends, Dino decides to hire an actress called Noor
        to play his wife while Dadi is visiting. Dadi immediately figures this
        out and hires Noor herself to teach Dino a lesson.</image:caption
