        >Brasilintime is a filmic map that connects the world of Rio de Janeiro
        of the late teens to the South Bronx of the early 70s. The roads from
        Samba through Bossa Nova to Hip Hop are a complex web of musical
        whispers and echoes. Brasilintime is a 2-hour documentary that traverses
        this journey. In November of 2002, drummers and DJs traveled to Sao
        Paulo Brazil to expand the multi-generational conversation to include
        their counterparts from the world of Samba, Bossa Nova and Samba Rock,
        as well as the best new talent from Brazilian Hip Hop. This show was
        recorded and became the basis for this DVD. Brasilintime speaks the
        language of the music it addresses.</image:caption
