        >"The Songs Aren't Good Enough, There Aren't Any Singles And It'll Never
        Get Played On The Radio" - Like the other reissues, the DVD includes a
        documentary on the album. The title - The Songs Aren't Good Enough,
        There Aren't Any Singles and It'll Never Get Played on the Radio - is
        Gore paraphrasing Daniel Miller about his demos for Black Celebration in
        the film. The double-documentary discusses both The Singles 81→85 and
        Black Celebration, its more challenging commercial success (especially
        the song "Stripped") and all five related singles. It also includes a
        plethora of behind-the-scenes footage of the making of Black Celebration
        and the ensuing tour. Highlights include the band meeting The Cure, and
        behind the scenes footage of several of the music videos. The
        documentary is nearly an hour long.</image:caption
