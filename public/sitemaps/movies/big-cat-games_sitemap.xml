        >From extreme speed to bone crushing bites, big cats are some of the
        most impressive predators on the planet. Each of them is an incredible
        animal, with its own unique and special set of skills. In Big Cat Games,
        we will challenge ferocious felines against each other in a series of
        trials that will determine once and for all who is king of the cats. In
        the wild they are confident, dominant, and fearlessâ€”but they have never
        had to face anything like this before. Lions, cheetahs and tigers will
        be pushed to the limits of their natural athletic
        abilities</image:caption
