        >In L.A.'s Laurel Canyon, Karen has a dream that her sister Heather is
        in danger, but Heather seems safe enough, having just moved to a remote
        spur of the canyon to distance herself from her ex-husband. She's a
        writer, and she's soon met several men - Marcus, who helps her the day
        she moves in, neighbors Daniel and Marisa for whom she cooks dinner, and
        Michael her landlord who cleans her pool weekly. Daniel warns her away
        from Marcus even as he makes a play for her and invites her to
        participate in sexual escapades - some enjoyable, some not. Then it
        becomes clear that Karen's anxiety dream was prescient. Who can Heather
        trust, and does she figure it out too late?</image:caption
