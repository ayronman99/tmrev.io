        >A mischievous nine-year-old girl's quick and simple get-rich-quick
        scheme hits an unexpected hitch when she incurs the wrath of a powerful
        gangster who is determined to hold onto his money in director Dan T.
        Hall's fast-paced family comedy. Molly Thompson has been sent to the
        principal's office yet again. A computer savvy pre-teen with a terminal
        case of curiosity, Molly intercepts an e-mail from a supposed Nigerian
        diplomat offering $3 million to anyone who can help him transport some
        stolen funds. When Molly combines her keen business sense with her
        nine-year-old brother Alex's killer skills at the keyboard, it appears
        as if the entrepreneurial siblings have netted their first cool million.
        Their celebration is cut somewhat short, however, upon learning that the
        fraudulent e-mail was not actually from a Nigerian diplomat in genuine
        need of help, but an international mobster whose clever scheme has
        pulled in piles of cash.</image:caption
