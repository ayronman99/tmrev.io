        >Sarah is a nurse at a Public Maternity Hospital. The hospital is abuzz
        with pregnant mothers of all shapes and sizes in different stages of
        labor. The hospital is short on staff on Christmas Day so Sarah is
        forced to put in a double shift. Sarah observes the women coming and
        going in her ward, noting who is a first-timer and who is a veteran.
        Meanwhile, the wards are overcrowded : two women and their babies
        sharing single beds while those in labor are spilling unto the hallways.
        Sarah takes these all in stride, her heart and mind laboring over her
        own personal pains.</image:caption
