        >DÃ©ficit follows one day of crisis in the life of Cristobal (Gael Garcia
        Bernal), a spoilt, rich kid throwing a party for his friends at his
        parents' luxurious villa. A big fence and a live-in staff of servants
        are there to shield Cristobal from the harsher realities of life, while
        his younger sister Elisa (Camila Sodi), there with her own crowd, uses
        drugs as her chosen means of escape. There are, however, some realities
        that cannot be kept at bay forever, like the reason behind their
        parents' prolonged absence, the gradual breakdown in the villa's
        amenities, and Cristobal's dwindling university
        prospects.</image:caption
