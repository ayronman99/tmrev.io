        >Eva is a young and independent cartoonist who returns to Málaga (Spain)
        to spend the summer holidays. There she meets her mother and Gema, her
        best friend. What she does not expect is to meet again with Rubén, her
        old boyfriend, with whom she has not had any contact since he broke off
        all relations with her unexpectedly, without farewells, six years ago.
        Eva will have to think about whether to give Rubén a second chance while
        she remembers her past, as well as the reason why the young man decided
        to get away from her.</image:caption
