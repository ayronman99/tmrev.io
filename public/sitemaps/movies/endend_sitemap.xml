        >My missing brother suddenly returned to his sister, who lives alone.
        However, his brother looks strange. All memories are ambiguous, even
        with blurring symptoms. He said "Congratulations" many times,
        remembering that her sister was pregnant, even though her symptoms
        didn't improve at all. One day, a man who said he was working in the
        same store as his brother came and it became clear how his brother lost
        his memory. A little hope can be seen beyond the natural appearance of
        people living in despair.</image:caption
