        >A dynamic look into the traditions of the black storefront churches as
        photographed by noted social documentary photographer, Milton Rogovin.
        Encouraged by famous African-American sociologist Dr. W.E.B. Du Bois,
        Rogovin photographed the storefront churches of Buffalo, New York for
        three years. The images are filled with the movement and expression of
        worship. With music and preaching recorded at the services, the energy
        of his photographs come to life. Featuring interviews with Alton B.
        Pollard III, Dean of Howard University School of Divinity and Milton
        Rogovin.</image:caption
