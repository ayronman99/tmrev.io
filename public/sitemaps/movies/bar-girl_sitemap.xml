        >Chiaki is a cute girl adopted by Souichi. She works with her father in
        his bar and becomes the attraction of the bar. Souichi loves Chiaki not
        as an adopted daughter but a woman with his passion suppressed. One day
        he asks her to leave the bar to work outside…. Yoshie comes to the bar
        to fill the vacancy. She looks exactly the same as Souichi’s dead wife.
        Souichi treats her as his wife’s substitute to release his
        passion.</image:caption
