        soldiers day and night, interrupted almost exclusively by the games of
        the World Cup with the historic encounter between the GDR and the FRG.

        driver who lives in the neighbouring village. Christine encourages him
        not to do what his father expects, but to follow his dream of becoming a
        photographer. But when her brother sends Alex's photo from the border
