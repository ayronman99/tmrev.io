        >Nourished by pain, it corrupts the intimacy of a couple that has lost
        their child. The mother, Gracinda Nave, refuses to speak, transforming
        their home in a place of mourning where memories shatter lovers, ruining
        the relation with her husband, José Airosa. The original soundtrack is,
        in itself, a metaphor of how one can escape from grief, in a way the
        final duet symbolizes everything unsaid between them, through out the
        film. The director, Margarida Leitão, employs the symbology of a
        balloon, a puzzle and some drawings to create little flashes of a past
        filled with colour. A chromatic journey across the instants of another
        life when we could hear a child's laughter and the house was filled with
        joy. But now, the house is an empty space where the two lovers drift
        apart.</image:caption
