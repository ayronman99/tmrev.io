        >11 year old Mahmoud from Cairo loves the circus, and dreams of
        performing as an acrobat in The National Egyptian Circus. So Mahmoud
        practice several days a week with the experienced circus artist Kamal,
        who joggles Mahmoud on his feet one and a half metres above the ground
        in a dangerous and daring acrobatic act. But the day only has so many
        hours, and there is also so much homework to do. So Mahmoud struggles to
        live his dream, and keep his place above the ground, beneath the
        sky.</image:caption
