        >Ariana tells the story of a film crew that sets out to visit the
        Pandjsher Valley in Northern Afghanistan. Described in classic Persian
        poetry as a ‘paradise garden,’ the impenetrable nature of the valley and
        its lush, fertile landscape have set it apart from the rest of the
        country and encouraged a history of independence and resistance.
        Hugonnier’s film considers how the specificities of a landscape help to
        determine its history. After the crew is unable to film the valley from
        a vantage point in the surrounding Hindu Kush mountains, Ariana becomes
        the story of a failed project that prompts a process of reflection about
        the ‘panorama’ as a form of strategic overview, as a cinematic camera
        move, and its origins as pre-cinematic mass
        entertainment.</image:caption
