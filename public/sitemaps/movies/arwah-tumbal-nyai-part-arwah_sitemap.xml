        >Syurkiani is very curious why she is always banned by her grandmother,
        Lela, to learn jaipong dance. Silently Syurkiani comes to Nyi Imas, a
        former jaipong dancer to learn the dance. Nyi Imas asks Syurkiani to hit
        the mystery drum three times as a condition. However, Syurkiani hit the
        drum four times. After that incident Syurkiani's grandmother dies of
        being attacked by a supernatural being. Syurkiani is also the target of
        the supernatural beings because she summons the spirit by hitting drums
        four times. Syukriani and his boyfriend, Shakti, try to escape the
        attack. Finally she knows that the supernatural being is related to the
        death of her grandmother. Even from this incident she finds her mother
        she never knew.</image:caption
