        >The worlds of glitz, glam, and pop-rock fused immortally on Goodbye
        Yellow Brick Road, born of the formidable partnership of Elton John and
        Bernie Taupin. This 1973 double album may well have been the peak of
        their collaboration. Ranging from perennial favorites like "Candle in
        the Wind," "Benny and the Jets," and the title track to more ambitious
        compositions like "Funeral for a Friend (Love Lies Bleeding)" and
        everything in between, Goodbye is unmatched in its depth and scope. This
        entry in the Classic Albums series of DVDs documents the often
        tumultuous writing and recording sessions for that masterpiece through
        vintage clips of the musicians in the studio and new interviews with
        Elton, Bernie, producer Gus Dudgeon, and the band members. We may never
        know how the John-Taupin team achieved their magic, but this release
        offers a both a peek at the process and a few reasons why the album
        endures today.</image:caption
