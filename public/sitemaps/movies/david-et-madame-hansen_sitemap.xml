        >David is an occupational therapist who has recently arrived at a clinic
        for wealthy patients. One morning, he is entrusted with Madame
        Hansen-Bergmann, a wealthy woman suffering from transient amnesia and
        post-traumatic stress , with the mission of taking her to the nearby
        village to buy a new pair of shoes. Against his will, he embarks with
        her on a breathtaking chase during which he discovers the past life of
        his patient and the origins of the illness from which she
        suffers.</image:caption
