        >The documentary observes two matriarchs - Tiina Jantson governs the
        beauty contest empire in Estonia; Anne Eenpanu leads the activities of
        "Home Daughters" - a girls' corps of Estonian Defence League. The film's
        main characters and their activities are very different. Whereas Anne's
        pedagogical approach is almost totally based on the love for fatherland
        then Tiina spends her days in the glitter of show business. However,
        there are some similiarities in their lives. The documentary studies the
        values, gender roles and moral norms in Estonia at the beginning of 21st
        century.</image:caption
