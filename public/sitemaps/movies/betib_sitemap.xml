        >Once Pedro Chazarreta found murdered in the wonderful gated, El Tribuno
        newspaper hires retired detective novelist Nurit Iscar/Betibù that is
        installed in the area and a series of newspaper columns about the case.
        Along with the Chief of police of the newspaper, Mariano Saravia, and a
        veteran journalist, Jaime Breña, Betibù starts to investigate the
        murder. Using an old photo of the adolescence of Chazarreta, which shows
        him with fellow high school, the Group discovers an apparent connection
        between this murder and a succession of apparently trivial deaths of
        members of the photo. At the same time, Betibù must face its past
        emotional with the editor of the newspaper, Lorenzo Rinaldi, who seeks
        to restore the relationship.</image:caption
