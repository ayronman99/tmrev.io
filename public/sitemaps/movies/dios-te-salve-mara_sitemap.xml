        >Alicante, year 1939. In the last moments of the Civil War, the Air Raid
        Shelters became the safest place to save the lives of thousands of
        people during the bombings. They sheltered fear, but also the story of
        many people like Maria, a young dreamer, eager to show the world that
        love can overcome anything. That it doesn't matter if a thousand bombs
        fall, as long as love exists, there is hope. A hope that she imagines
        with Carmen, a young woman from the Santa Cruz neighborhood, daughter of
        fishermen, with whom she maintains a close relationship. A secret
        relationship, full of clandestine meetings in the
        shelters.</image:caption
