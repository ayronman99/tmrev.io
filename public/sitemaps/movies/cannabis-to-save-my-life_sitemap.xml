        >Marijuana as a cancer fighting drug? Science says yes, federal law says
        no. Patricia Crone is caught in the life-and-death stand-off. Patricia
        Crone, a professor of Islamic history at the Institute for Advanced
        Study in Princeton, was diagnosed with lung cancer in November 2011,
        when the cancer had already spread to her brain. She was busy preparing
        for the end when she saw that the National Cancer Institute described
        some of the chemicals in marijuana, or cannabis, as having
        cancer-fighting potential. With only grim prospects for the future, she
        wanted to try it. So Patricia, who had never had as much as a puff of
        pot, started a hunt for marijuana, and for credible evidence of its
        medicinal potential.</image:caption
