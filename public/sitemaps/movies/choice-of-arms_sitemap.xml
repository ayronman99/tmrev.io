        >Two men break out of prison; a rival gang ambushes them. One is
        mortally wounded and tells the other, Mickey, to take him to the estate
        of a retired robber, Noel, who lives in comfort with his lovely and
        beloved wife, Nicole. The man dies, and Mickey, a menacing hothead,
        demands money of Noel. A few days later, Mickey returns to the estate,
        shoots up a dinner party and threatens them again. Noel sends Nicole to
        an hotel and goes to his old gang to help him hunt down the dangerous
        Mickey. Mickey has other problems, too, including heartache for a
        daughter he hardly knows. Young, eager cops tail Nicole, and all are on
        a complicated collision course.</image:caption
