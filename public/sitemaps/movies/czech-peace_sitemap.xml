        >From the makers of legendary CZECH DREAM, a hilarious documentary about
        a hoax hypermarket, comes CZECH PEACE, a new playfully explosive flm
        about the mayor of a small Czech village and his attempts to foil the
        American plan to build its 762nd military base right on his doorstep.
        The players in this story are everyone from villagers to George W. Bush,
        Condoleezza Rice, Barack Obama, peace activists and lobbyists
        representing American arms manufacturers. Can the Mayor of Trokavec
        (population 80) take the US on? CZECH PEACE shows the workings of
        geopolitics and the way they affect the little people. The personal
        clashes with the impersonal, the specifc with the universal, and an
        individual with the so-called great history.</image:caption
