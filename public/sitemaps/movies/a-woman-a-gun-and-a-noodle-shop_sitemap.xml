        >Wang is a gloomy, cunning and avaricious noodle shop owner in a desert
        town in China. His neglected, sharp-tongued wife is involved in a secret
        affair with Li, one of Wangâ€™s employees. A timid man, Li reluctantly
        keeps the gun his lover has bought to kill her husband. But Wang is
        watching their every move. He bribes patrol officer Zhang to murder the
        illicit couple. It seems like a perfect plan: the affair will come to a
        cruel, bloody but satisfying end or so he thinks. The equally wicked
        Zhang has an agenda of his own. As the plot twists, more blood will
        flow, and ever greater violence will erupt.</image:caption
