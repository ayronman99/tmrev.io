        >This film by director Ramon Tort documents a unique moment in the life
        and career of Andrea Motis: the months preceding the recording of her
        first album in New York as well as what followed. A time filled with
        changes and emotions; from leaving her parents’ home for the first time
        and start living by herself to embarking in a world tour that would take
        her to places like Japan, United States, Asia and Europe. A crucial time
        in a young woman's life, who is about to make the big leap…, but is she
        interested in success or fame? Andrea is not a conventional artist. She
        lives in the moment, enjoying the small things in life, every day in the
        most simplest way possible… An entire magical process that can only be
        understood through her music.</image:caption
