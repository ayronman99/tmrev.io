        >A sixty minute special of the Crayon Shin-chan anime featuring a
        crossover between Shin-chan and the live action tokusatsu series Kamen
        Rider Den-O, as well as three normal summer-themed episodes. The Den-O
        characters are drawn in the style of Shin-chan's regular characters.
        Another thing of note, inbetween commercial breaks, clips of a live
        action Shin-Chan onboard the Den-Liner or with characters from the Kamen
        Rider Den-O Series were shown. In most of these scenes it involves the
        Owner giving Shin a speech of sorts or making Shin feel
        uncomfortable.</image:caption
