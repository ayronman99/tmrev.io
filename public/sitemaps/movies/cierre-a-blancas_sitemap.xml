        >The film is the story of Richard and his gambling problem. Addiction is
        the theme of the film, the compulsion to win and escape from his reality
        are the key elements of the story. What begins as an innocent game of
        dominoes has become the worst hand of Ricardo's life! How far can a
        player go when the addiction for one more game is the only thing in his
        mind? In one night, Ricardo will have the game of his life. Literally he
        can win or lose it all! How can a compulsive gambler stop if he is not
        aware of his passion-addiction? Even when his whole life is seen falling
        in front of him?</image:caption
