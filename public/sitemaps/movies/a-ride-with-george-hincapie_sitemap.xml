        >Spanning his early years as a junior to the disappointment of 2009
        Roubaix, this unadorned everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-the-guy
        portrait puts a microscope on the silent man of cycling, George
        Hincapie. Ride along with George as he shares his joys and inspirations,
        his fears and frustrations, his anger (or lack thereof), his hopes and
        dreams, his strengths and weaknesses, and his plans for the future as he
        gives us a unique peak into his private world. A Ride with George
        Hincapie is a feature-length film that provides an unprecedented look at
        the man behind the athlete.</image:caption
