        >The East London Line was filmed just a couple of years before its
        closure and total metamorhosis. Nowadays, forming part of the London
        Overground, here we can see the old Metropolitan stock as many of us
        remember them running on the East London Line. Services alternated
        between the two southern termini of New Cross and New Cross Gate. Our
        journey on board an ‘A’ stock train begins at the former and takes us
        through the very oldest part of civil engineering on the underground
        network, Marc Brunel’s 1843 tunnel under the Thames. Peak services
        continued to Shoreditch, which is where our journey ends.</image:caption
