        >In a small seaside town, two schoolgirls are assaulted by a middle-aged
        man in a motel. Mia, a teenager who was working on reception that night,
        is the only witness. For fear of losing her job, she says nothing.
        Meanwhile, 12-year-old Wen, one of the victims, finds that her troubles
        have only just begun. Trapped in a world that offers them no safety, Mia
        and Wen will have to find their own way out.</image:caption
