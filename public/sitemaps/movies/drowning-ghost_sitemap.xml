        >Hundred years ago, three students at the Hellestads Boarding School
        were brutally slaughtered, the murderer drowned himself in a lake nearby
        and his body was never found. The story has become a legend for
        generations of students as well as a yearly festivity. Sara, a student,
        is writting an essay based on the legend and uncovers new facts from the
        event that will cast dark shadows on the family name of one of the
        school's main benificiaries. On the night of the hundreth anniversary,
        the festivities go awry, students disappear and something dark and
        unknown is moving through the schools corridors...</image:caption
