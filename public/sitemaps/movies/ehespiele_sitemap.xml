        >When a doctor tells 47-year-old restorer Rike that she is in menopause,
        she can not believe it - she feels young and attractive. Her ex-husband
        Richard also sees that and therefore advises her to finally find a new
        partner. And at a vernissage, she meets a young and handsome Japanese
        man called Gen and falls head over heels in love with him. Also, Gen
        does not seem averse to a relationship. What Rike does not know is that
        Gene's heart belongs to his friend Thomas. In Rike, the homosexual young
        man sees the suitable marriage candidate to secure his stay in Germany.
        When Richard announces his wedding with his new girlfriend, Rike does
        not want to be inferior. Thomas, however, sees the fictitious marriage,
        which he himself has invented, with increasing jealousy: an angry fight
        over Gen's affection ensues between him and Rike, by all means and
        without regard for losses.</image:caption
