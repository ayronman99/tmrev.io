        >George was a dog. His mother was a dog too. George made different
        sounds, which made his mother take him to the vet/veterinarian. A
        veterinarian/vet will take an animal's health and temperatures. The vet
        said "Please bark, George" every single time after George's mother went
        on very desperate. Which was a reference to when George made strange
        sounds a dog doesn't say, George's mother tells before it happens, "No,
        George. A ___ goes "___". A dog goes "arf!" Now bark, George." Good
        thing George said the right thing. But before it happened, the vet put
        on his latex gloves and pulled out the animals.</image:caption
