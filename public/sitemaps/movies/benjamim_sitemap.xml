        >Benjamim Zambraia is a lonely man, a famous model with a tragic past.
        Some time in the past, he showed some officers the exact location where
        the woman he loved was hiding with her guerilla lover. As a result, the
        two were killed. One day, he casually meets a woman who looks very much
        like his former love, and this fact changes his life. Could she be the
        daughter of his great love? Or her reincarnation?</image:caption
