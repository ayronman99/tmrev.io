        >Deputy Bob is a story about Timmy O'Brien's journey to accept a place
        in his father's legacy, learning about his own identity during the
        process, and Professor Smith's misfortunes encountered while seeking
        approval from others. Intricately woven, both stories run parallel in
        current time and through remembrances of the past, while taking place on
        separate sides of the country. The common link is Dr. O'Brien, Timmy's
        father as well as Smith's boss, and his noble research into a radical
        cure for cancer. While mainly comedic, the story is also told with
        dramatic and surreal moments.</image:caption
