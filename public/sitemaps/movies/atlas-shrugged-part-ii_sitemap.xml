        >The global economy is on the brink of collapse. Brilliant creators,
        from artists to industrialists, continue to mysteriously disappear.
        Unemployment has risen to 24%. Gas is now $42 per gallon. Dagny Taggart,
        Vice President in Charge of Operations for Taggart Transcontinental, has
        discovered what may very well be the answer to the mounting energy
        crisis - found abandoned amongst ruins, a miraculous motor that could
        seemingly power the World. But, the motor is dead... there is no one
        left to decipher its secret... and, someone is watching. Itâ€™s a race
        against the clock to find the inventor and stop the destroyer before the
        motor of the World is stopped for good. A motor that would power the
        World. A World whose motor would be stopped. Who is John
        Galt?</image:caption
