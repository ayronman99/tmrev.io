        >Comfortably Numb shows us Jake's struggle to overcome his alcoholism in
        a rehab center, Promis. After early difficulties, he starts to make
        progress when he forms a relationship with a fellow patient, Emma. But
        they are forbidden to see each other after Jake is confronted about his
        "sex and love" addiction in a group counselling session. This creates
        more problems, as Jake doesn't understand that his dependence on the
        relationship with Emma is actually a barrier to his rehabilitation. A
        night of excess sparked by drugs makes things get out of hand. Jake
        decides to leave the center and fight his addiction on his own terms.
        But almost immediately he goes into a pub. It seems as though Jake will
        fall back into being an alcoholic, but as the film ends, we see that he
        has returned to Promis, and is determined to make a full recovery this
        time.</image:caption
