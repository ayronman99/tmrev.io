        >Billy is a teenage outcast in search of his life's true meaning. Day by
        day, he slaves away at the local burger joint, only to return home to a
        paraplegic father, whose own dreams of happiness have faded away in an
        alcoholic haze. Nonetheless, Billy tries to bond with his delusional
        father, but cannot break through the many layers of pain and regret that
        surround him. Frustrated, Billy longs to escape the dead-end existence
        that has engulfed his father, and now appears to be closing in on him as
        well.</image:caption
