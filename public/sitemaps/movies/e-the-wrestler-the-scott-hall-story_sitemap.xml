        >In his prime, Scott Hall was a mountain of a man - 6-foot-7, 290 pounds
        of solidly sculptured muscle, appearing as close as invincible as they
        come. As Razor Ramon, he was one of professional wrestling's biggest
        names and most villainous villains, busting chairs with the likes of
        Randy Savage, Bret Hart and Hulk Hogan in front of tens of thousands of
        screaming fans in sold-out arenas. And he loved the life that came with
        it: the parties, the women, the celebrity. But the high life soon
        started to slip away, and Hall has been desperately doing whatever he
        can since to hold on ever since. E:60 chronicles the heartbreaking story
        of a man who is a shadow of his former self and desperate for one last
        taste of the glory days.</image:caption
