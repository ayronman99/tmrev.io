        >Tim and Lee are married with a young child. The chance to stay at a
        fancy home in the Hollywood Hills is complicated by Tim's discovery of a
        bone and a rusty old gun in the yard. Tim is excited by the idea of a
        mystery, but Lee doesn't want him to dig any further, preferring that he
        focus on the family taxes, which he promised to do weeks ago. This
        disagreement sends them on separate and unexpected adventures over the
        course of a weekend, as Tim and his friends seek clues to the mystery
        while Lee searches for answers to the bigger questions of marriage and
        parenthood.</image:caption
