        >Jack Malloy is a hardcore career criminal until a near-death experience
        causes him to turn his world around. But when his former partner Drake
        is released from prison, he tracks Jack down to blackmail him into one
        last job. Jack is a new man determined to lead an honest life. Drake is
        a charming psycho intent on vengeance. Sometimes, old friends can carry
        some extreme baggage. And for one of them, coming to terms with the past
        is going to be murder. Vanessa Gray and Andy McPhee co-star in this taut
        action/drama about good intentions, dark secrets and the harsh
        consequences of BAD KARMA.</image:caption
