        >On June 16, 1983, in front of a capacity crowd of 25,000 at Madison
        Square Garden, the lives of two young men were forever changed during a
        controversial boxing match. A tough club fighter from Puerto Rico named
        Luis Resto fought Billy Collins Jr., an Irish golden boy, for ten
        grueling rounds. Resto was declared the winner, but within minutes, was
        accused of tampering with the padding in his gloves - in effect
        brutalizing Collins Jr. with his bare fists for thirty minutes. More
        than two decades later, Luis Resto is still a broken man shouldering the
        burden of his opponent's death; a prison sentence; and a lifetime ban
        from boxing. Resto relives that infamous night in New York City and
        exposes the sport's dark side - unfolding an emotional story which
        finally reveals the truth.</image:caption
