        >Dante Milestone, a world-weary baby-boomer, is not happy. His struggles
        with everyday life, his past, even the question of 'the existence of a
        higher power', have led him to evaluate his own life. An assessment,
        that ultimately drives him to leave work and success behind, and set out
        on a quest in search of his happiness. But Dante soon learns that it's
        not that simple, for after a series of painfully humorous attempts fail
        to provide an answer, Dante sinks even deeper. It is not until he
        encounters Cynthia, a spiritual guide of sorts, that he uncovers the
        underlying truth and finally arrives at an answer that surprises even
        him.</image:caption
