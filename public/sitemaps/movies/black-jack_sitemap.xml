        >Black Jack Murphy (Robert Woods) is the brains in an outfit of outlaws
        who rob the bank at Tusca City. All goes to plan with the heist but once
        the loot is safely obtained Jack's men lose no time in trying to double
        cross him. Wily Jack manages to outfox them at first and gets away with
        the cash but they soon catch up with him again and not only make off
        with the money but leave him crippled and carrying multiple causes for
        wanting revenge. This need for amends possesses Jack with an all
        consuming passion and he sets out to get even with each of his
        unfaithful former compadres but has his particular sights set on Indian
        Joe (Mimmo Palmara) and Sanchez (Rik Battaglia) who abused and killed
        his beloved sister. Source: SWDB
