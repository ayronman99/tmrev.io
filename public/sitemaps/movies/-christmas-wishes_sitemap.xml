        >Holiday magic has never gleamed brighter as Santa’s Elves head out on
        an adventure to bring every boy and girl their Christmas wish while also
        bringing a family back together in this heartfelt Christmas movie from
        Gaumont. After accidentally destroying a bag of Christmas wishes from a
        small town on the eve of Christmas Eve, two junior elves learn that if
        even one wish goes unfulfilled, Christmas could be extinguished forever.
        For the first time in their lives, the elves Mindy and Cam venture out
        of the North Pole and sneak into Minnedoza to collect the lost wishes.
        Along the way they enlist the help of young Blake, whose family has a
        difficult time celebrating Christmas since his father died. With their
        deadline fast approaching, Mindy and Cam have only one more wish to
        find…but whose could it be? It’s up to Mindy and Cam to find out and
        save Christmas!</image:caption
