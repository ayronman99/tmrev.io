        >A young man wakes up naked on a pallet on the street in Montreal. Who
        is he, what is his name? How did he get here? The only thing he seems to
        remember is that he's gay. And so begins one of the most compelling

        has been through some trauma that caused his memory loss -- or is he an
        imposter avoiding the law in some way?</image:caption
