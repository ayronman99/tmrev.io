        >A road movie about two very different brothers who have not seen each
        other for 20 years: city manager Christian and cabinetmaker Georg, who
        never left their hometown and took care of their father until his
        passing. After their fathers funeral, the brothers decide on a whim, and
        with some help from the alcohol, to fulfil their old dream: travel
        trough Germany together on their mopeds.</image:caption
