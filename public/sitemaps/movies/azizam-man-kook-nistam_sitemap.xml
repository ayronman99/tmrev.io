        >Hamid Afshari, the secretary at the courthouse (Parviz Parastui), is
        running out of money to buy a computer for his son. Desperate, he plans
        to kidnap Farzan, the son of Mr. Zare, a rich party that had a trial in
        court. For this, he takes for accomplice Asghar, a gangster already
        condemned. Asghar locks Farzan in a villa in the suburbs. To catch the
        kidnappers, Mr. Zare feigns a state of emergency and is hospitable.
        Hamid Afshari rushes to the hospital to inquire about his state of
        health. Roya, the nurse who informs her (Fatemeh Motamed-Arya), seems
        very welcoming and helpful. Finding her to his liking, Hamid feels very
        quickly in love with her...</image:caption
