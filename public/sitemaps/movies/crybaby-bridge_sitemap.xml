        >Nick, Ryan, and Bill have a dream: to have their own hunting show on
        television. With the help of their camera man Craig and the funding of
        the National Gun Owners of America, they are given the chance at a trial
        run, a documentary about the hunting experience. But when they cross the
        bridge and into the woods beyond, the hunters find themselves in the
        midst of the legend of Elizabeth, a vengeful specter willing to do
        whatever it takes to be reunited with her lost child. As the documentary
        progresses, the strange events continue to escalate to a deadly climax.
        Can the hunters save themselves from becoming the hunted, or are they
        doomed to be become a permanent part of the legend of Crybaby
        Bridge?</image:caption
