        >"From the first punch to the last chord," Volume II delivers a
        non-stop, in your face, visual and auditory glimpse into the dark and
        violent world of underground hardcore and punk rock. Featuring live
        performances and interviews from such bands as Blood for Blood, Death
        Before Dishonor, and Righteous Jams, and featuring never-before-seen
        footage from bands such as Wrecking Crew, In My Eyes and Ten Yard Fight,
        this sequel DVD has, in many eyes, already proven itself to be the
        hardest and most graphic look at the hardcore scene ever. Backed with
        exclusive interviews by founding members of Boston's notorious F.S.U.
        gang and scored by a soundtrack of some of Boston's hardest music,
        Volume II, tells the story and history of Boston hardcore from past
        until present.</image:caption
