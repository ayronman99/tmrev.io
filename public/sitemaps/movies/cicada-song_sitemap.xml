        >Karen is a tough, corn fed, outspoken, farm manager who cares about the
        people she works for and the migrant people who work for her. When one
        of her farmhands approaches her about a little girl that has recently
        disappeared, she becomes closer to her employees than she ever thought
        possible. But, when her lover, Annabelle, disappears, the bubble Karen
        lives in bursts and she begins an investigation only to uncover
        something dark in the little town she grew up in.</image:caption
