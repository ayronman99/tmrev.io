        >The widow, Deputy Sheriff Jane Kozik, moves from Manhattan to Black
        Stone, New York, with her daughter Kelsey Kozik. There she expects to
        find a safe place to live. The day after moving, a homeless man is found
        dead in the tool shed of Jane's blind friend Beverly Rowe. Devin Hall
        and the entomologist Katherine Randell are summoned to help with the
        investigation. Devin is Jane's brother-in-law and former boyfriend, and
        Jane still has a crush on him. Meanwhile, Kelsey befriends the scientist
        Eli Giles, who has developed genetically modified wasps to the army as a
        weapon, and now he is trying to revert the process. When the wasps
        attack Black Stone, Jane, Devin and Eli team-up to attempt to destroy
        the swarm.</image:caption
