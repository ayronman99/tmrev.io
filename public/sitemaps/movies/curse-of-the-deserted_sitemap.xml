        >Young writer Guo (Shawn Yue) wrote about a titular curse in his book,
        “The Deserted Village”. It began 500 years ago in the Ming Dynasty, when
        one of the villagers died of terminal illness. The widow Yanzi vowed to
        stay with her husband forever but when the man suddenly returned to
        life. The horrified neighbours believed that he was a monster. They
        burned him to death and torched his mansion. The devastated Yanzi upheld
        her vow and threw herself into the fire. Since then, the village was
        cursed and the mansion subsequent inhabitant dies mysteriously. Some say
        only couples who share true love can survive in that village. Those who
        are unfaithful will come to their demise. To the world, the book was
        pure fiction. Only Guo and his ex-girlfriend Zhi (Kitty Zhang) had lived
        through the horror to know its existence. When four college students
        decided to explore the village themselves, the trip led them to an
        ancient well in Yanzi’s mansion, where the curse was unleashed once
        again.</image:caption
