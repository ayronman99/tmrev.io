        >The film starts with Gian seeing some like spirit and it asks him to
        accomplish a task. The story starts when a stray dogs are searching some
        foods in the can. Then a dirty white dog comes out of nowhere. Just
        then, the dog creates a close stare to the stray dogs and forces to run
        away. But the dog is disappointed that he doesn't know what to do after
        searching the garbage, under the pouring rain. After that, Suneo starts
        saying about the discoverable places on Earth and him and Gian are
        totally disappointed about that. That then, they are asking favor to
        Nobita to take them to an undiscovered place to be seen by their naked
        eyes. Nobita refuses but tells he will try his best. He comes to
        upstairs to explain Doraemon what the problem is now.</image:caption
