        >Haji Zaini and Dato' Osman, two family friends, have promised an
        arranged marriage between their two children, Fazira and Yusry, when
        they were still very little. Twenty years later, Yusry returns home from
        England as a handsome and educated young man. After not seeing each
        other for seven years, Yusry is appalled to find her childhood
        sweetheart (and future wife) as an overweight and introvert young woman.
        Deeming Fazira as not being up to his taste and standards, he rejects
        and humiliates Fazira in public. A year later, a beautiful model, Erra,
        turns up and captivates Yusry's heart, but all his attempts to befriend
        the model are shunned and pushed away.</image:caption
