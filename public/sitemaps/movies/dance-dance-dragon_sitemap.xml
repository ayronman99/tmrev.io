        >Ah Long's father was desperate to have a son born in the year of the
        Dragon because his ancestors had decreed that only a "Dragon boy"could
        take over family's lion dance association, His mother instead gives
        birth to "Dragon girls" while Ah Long himself was born several seconds
        after the clock struck twelve, making him a "Snake baby", much to the
        disappointment of his father. At present time, Mother Long orays to the
        gods for blessings on her three children and pours out her desire for a
        grandchild. The oldest daughter Lucy, 48, is a spinster and can't find
        suitable work. The second daughter Ah Bee, 36, is a gambling addiction
        counselor who is tomboyish and was recently dumped by her boyfriend. The
        youngest and only son Ah Long is married but is terrified of children.
        Meanwhile up in heaven, the gods are growing sick and tired of hearing
        Mother Long's daily prayers for a grandchild and deliberate whether to
        grant Mother Long her wish....</image:caption
