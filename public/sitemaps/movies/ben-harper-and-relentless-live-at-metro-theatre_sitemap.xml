        >The California native is a natural born showman, a slide-guitar legend
        whose ability to dabble in (and pull off) everything from folk blues to
        country jazz and reggae has earned Harper legions of fans the world
        over. So when we were given the opportunity to film Ben Harper
        accompanied by the blues-driven Texas trio Relentless7 at the Metro in
        Sydney, needless to say we were a little bit excited. And it may have
        been filmed in 2009, but this show was such a stand out favorite of ours
        there was no question that it was set to become a Classic
        Concerts.</image:caption
