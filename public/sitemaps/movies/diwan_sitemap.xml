        >Raghavan (Sarathkumar) and Velu (Vadivelu) work as cooks in a non-veg
        hotel. Raghavan loves Geetha (Kiran) who is the daughter of a rich man
        (Vijayan), but her father is against this love and insults him as a poor
        man. Raghavan challenges that he will be rich in a year. There is a
        subplot in the story, for Meenakshi (Sharmili), a daughter from a rich
        family; she is the apple of the eye of the family. Meenakshi ran home
        with her lover Raju, who worked as a driver to her house. He tells that
        his friend Dinesh will help them. However, Raju escaped because he saw a
        bad dream where he is killed by her family as if it will happen in
        reality. Due to that he vanishes. Raghavan understood her plight and
        helps her.</image:caption
