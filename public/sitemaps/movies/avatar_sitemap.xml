        >Michiko lost her dad in a car accident when she was 10 years old. After
        the car accident, Michiko has lived with her mother Kyoko. Michiko, now
        in her 2nd year of high school, gets a cell phone from her mother as a
        birthday present. Michiko is so excited to have her very first cell
        phone. Soon afterwards, she is forced into joining social networking
        site "AvaQ" by classmate, and queen of the classroom,
        Taeko.</image:caption
