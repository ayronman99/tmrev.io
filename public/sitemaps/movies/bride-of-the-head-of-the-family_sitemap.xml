        himself, Myron Stackpool, attempts to rebuild his empire from the ashes
        of destruction. But finding his lost fortune and missing siblings is

        doctors, deformed hit men, sexual orderlies, and more - as they all race
        to the wedding of - the BRIDE OF THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY!</image:caption
