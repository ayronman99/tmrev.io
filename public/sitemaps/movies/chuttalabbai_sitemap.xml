        >Recovery Agent Babji (Aadi) came across a girl, named Kavya (Namitha
        Pramod) and helped her. He came to know that she was in danger from her
        family. Babji saves her. Unfortunately Kavya’s brother (Abhimanyu Singh)
        misunderstood that Babji was behind this and starts chasing the couple.
        Babji takes Kavya with him to his village and introduces her as his best
        friend. As time passes Kavya falls in love with Babji, but at the end
        both Kavya’s family and another gang attacks Babji and his family. The
        rest of the story shows how Babji handles the issue, solves his problems
        and ends up marrying Kavya.</image:caption
