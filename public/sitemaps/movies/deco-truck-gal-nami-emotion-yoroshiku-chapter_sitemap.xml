        School girl called Kanna shows up. She tells Nami that she is her
        long-lost sister since she was 5 years old, and she has run away from

        become of the ongoing romance with Kikuo!?!? The 4th installments of the
        popular “Deco Truck Nami” series – More drama, more tears and simply
        irresistible!</image:caption
