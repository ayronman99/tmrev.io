        >An orange Chevrolet Impala drives across a cemetery towards an
        abandoned shipwreck in the middle of a desert landscape. It is the 22nd
        of January, 1965. The day before, the Iranian prime minister was shot
        dead in front of the parliament building. Inside the wreck, a banished
        political prisoner has hung himself. The walls are covered in diary
        entries, literary quotes and strange symbols. Can they help Police
        Inspector Babak Hafizi in his investigations? Will they shed any light
        on why there is always an earthquake whenever somebody is buried in this
        desert cemetery?</image:caption
