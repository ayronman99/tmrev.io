        >Tens of millennia ago, eight gods who ceaselessly fought each other
        were exiled to earth. For generations, they have been reincarnated as
        mere mortals, and they won't be allowed back to heaven until they've
        learned to coexist in harmony. Then in today's Hong Kong, a mortuary
        beautician and her has-been singer dad are chased for a huge sum of
        money they don't owe. Turns out her materialistic stepmom has taken a
        tycoon's advance payment on the false promise of organizing a concert
        that she can't deliver. The family is therefore forced to go on the run,
        and along the way they meet an assortment of quirky people, including a
        mute baker, a kung fu cab driver, an aspiring musician and her crafty
        sidekick. Through a series of comic misadventures, the seven of them
        come to realize that they used to be gods and have a mission in this
        life, but...who is the eighth god that has yet to rejoin
        them?</image:caption
