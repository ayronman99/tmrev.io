        >Cosimo is Italian, Nicole French. They meet in Genoa during the G8
        protests and immediately fall in love. Swept off their feet by an
        overwhelming and uncontrollable passion, they decide never to part.
        After much wandering they decide to return to Genoa, where they start
        working for a friend of theirs who organises concerts. Things seem to be
        going well until a tragic accident almost sours their relationship, as a
        result of which theyâ€™re faced with two options that can change their
        future. Forever.</image:caption
