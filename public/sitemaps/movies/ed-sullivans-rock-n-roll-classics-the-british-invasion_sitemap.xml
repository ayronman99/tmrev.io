        >On Sunday nights throughout the '50s and '60s, Ed Sullivan brought pop
        culture into America's living rooms with the most influential show of
        its kind. If you made it there, you had it made because for the first
        time, the entire county was at home watching. During the course of the
        show's run, many of the early rock and roll legends were featured in
        career-defining performances. These cultural milestones have been
        compiled for Ed Sullivan's Rock 'n' Roll Classics, along with archival
        footage and narration for insight on the artists, their eras, and their
        classic appearances. Now seen with half a century of hindsight , it's
        clear Ed Sullivan was right--his was a really big show</image:caption
