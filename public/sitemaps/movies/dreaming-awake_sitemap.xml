        >Recently appointed dean at a film school, Kimuro Hajime develops a
        special concern for one of his students, Daisuke. The brash, headstrong
        young man is fixated on with the Second World War. He feels a sense of
        frustration at the irrational sacrifice of young people's lives during
        the war six decades earlier. Daisuke finds that he can vent his
        frustrations to Kimuro, who experienced the war firsthand. Kimuro's
        wife, Emiko, is also troubled by memories of the war. She lost a loved
        one in the war and has never gotten over it. And Kimuro himself also has
        something from the past that he has yet to face. He believes that the
        burden of his unresolved past will eventually be the death of him. When
        Daisuke's neurosis causes him to quit school, life changes for all three
        of them.</image:caption
