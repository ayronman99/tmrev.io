        >In 1964, John-Boy Walton is planning his wedding to Janet Gilchrist,
        the editor of a New York fashion magazine and the daughter of a
        diplomat. The two of them plan a small wedding and he invites the family
        and friends from Walton's Mountain to come to New York for the
        celebration. However, Janet's Aunt Flo has other ideas and begins to
        take over their wedding preparations. Added to the wedding plan stress,
        John-Boy is also trying to write an article about his Grandma, but
        decides that he needs to go home to escape the wedding preparations, as
        well as to reunite with his grandmother and fill in some gaps leaving
        Janet in New York trying to prevent her wedding from getting out of
        hand. But she too leaves the city and heads for Walton's Mountain to
        plan their wedding there.</image:caption
