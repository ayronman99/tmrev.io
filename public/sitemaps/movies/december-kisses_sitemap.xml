        >Drama - Freddy, an injured man on the run, is taken in by Thomas, a
        kindhearted priest, and nursed back to health in the bell tower of the
        church by the priest's beautiful and innocent daughter, Anna. It doesn't
        take long for a romance to bloom between Freddy and Anna, leaving Thomas
        to choose between his religious commitment to help the vulnerable and
        his love for his daughter. - Achim Amme, Frauke Bartels, Sarah
