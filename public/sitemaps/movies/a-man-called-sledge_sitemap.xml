        >James Garner is Luther Sledge, the leader of a pack of rebels who are
        planning to steal a stash of gold. But after the thieves actually manage
        to get away with the bounty, they soon discover that the enemy lies
        within their midst. As they begin to bicker over who should get the
        biggest cut, the stage is set for a deadly showdown. Claude Akins and
        John Marley co-star in this Italian Western directed by Vic
