        >Wealthy American, Jervis Pendleton has a chance encounter at a French
        orphanage with a cheerful 18-year-old residen, and anonymously pays for
        her education at a New England college. She writes letters to her
        mysterious benefactor regularly, but he never writes back. Several years
        later, he visits her at school, while still concealing his identity,
        and—despite their large age difference—they soon fall in
        love.</image:caption
