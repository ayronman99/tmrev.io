        >Two friends try to do the right thing. Seth and Nole's pal Ally has
        just died. As they sort through her things, they find a winning lottery
        ticket - unclaimed and for a massive sum. Legally, Ally's abusive
        ex-husband is entitled to the winnings but the boys decide to keep the
        ticket out of his hands. There's just one problem. The executor of
        Ally's estate is her sister, a stickler for rules.</image:caption
