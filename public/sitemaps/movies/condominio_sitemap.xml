        >Three stories happen simultaneously within one Condominium. Three
        stories about the limits human beings will go to in the simple attempt
        to be happy. Clotilde lives in number 24. She is an elderly lady and the
        sole responsible of her son, Javier, who is schizophrenic. But they have
        found an equilibrium to survive their misery. An equilibrium that may be
        broken at any time. Number 7 is home to Janet, a pregnant prostitute.
        She lives with Leslie, her junkie colleague. They know they have no
        future. But they have a plan. They need to go to Miami. The father of
        Janet's unborn child has the money they need. And they have decided to
        take the respect they are owed. Above the girls lives Fredy. He is in
        love with Álvaro, who has AIDS. Together they have established a shelter
        where people infected with HIV can find company. But Álvaro is dimming.
        Fredy won't accept it, but Alvaro has little time left. Three stories to
        continue sharing the same Condominium. ¿Where do YOU
        live?</image:caption
