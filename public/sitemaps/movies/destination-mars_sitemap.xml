        >Martian women from Mars have sent an army of killer robots to take over
        planet Earth, and the only hope for mankind may be a Doomsday weapon
        built by a mysterious inventor in this throwback sci-fi entry with a
        double shot of 1950s retro kitch. As killer robots descend from the sky,
        a hapless police officer is abducted by a UFO and a young couple finds
        their romantic picnic rudely interrupted by the shiny metallic invaders.
        Though a doomsday weapon of unimaginable power may be mankind's only
        defense against the powerful invaders, it could also spell the end for
        the human race as we know it.</image:caption
