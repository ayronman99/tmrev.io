        >A young witch gathers her coven to methodically fulfill her uncle's
        demands to help resurrect a demon lover from centuries past. Believing
        that she has completed her tasks she waits for the resurrection and her
        eternal rewards only to find neither are really what she expected. The
        resurrected lover is not exactly the beautiful woman her uncle talked of
        in years past and the rewards her uncle had in mind for her are not made
        of a princes' fairy tales. The young witch finds the real truth of the
        "Blood Lengend".</image:caption
