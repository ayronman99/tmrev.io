        >After his mother's death, 17-year-old Sven moves in with his dad Achim,
        a taxi driver, who had divorced his mother several years earlier. It is
        not easy for Achim to get used to an adolescent around the house,
        especially since Sven hardly speaks to him. But Sven does well in
        school, and Achim hopes that time will bring them closer together. It is
        Achim's girlfriend Julia who first senses that something is wrong with
        Sven. Why, she wonders, does he always hang around with young boys? Why
        does not he have any friends his own age? She suspects that he is gay.
        The truth, however, is somewhat more nuanced - and chilling: Sven has
        pedophile tendencies. Proof is soon found on videos that shock and
        sicken Achim. Sven himself is shattered and regrets his actions. Julia
        suggests therapy, but Achim is convinced that he and Sven can handle
        this together. But he is wrong. Though Sven practically begs his father
        to lock him up in his room, Achim has confidence in his
        son.</image:caption
