        >Kevin Richardson, animal behaviorist, works with some of the most
        dangerous animals known to man. Rather than train the animals, he
        persuades them. To do this he uses his own unusual methods. He uses
        love, understanding, and trust, and has developed some very close bonds
        with these animals. He has become many things, a trusted ally, the
        dominant male of a clan of hyenas, a brother. But most of all he is
        well-loved and trusted by his animal friends. He sleeps with lions,
        cuddles new-born hyenas and swims with lionesses.</image:caption
