        >There is an underground battle going on in the name of love. The
        soldiers are all Pikapistas! With pick-up lines as their weapons to woo
        the gorgeous Neneng B. (Sam Pinto), the war sizzles in the dark corners
        of the Metro. And there is one undefeated champion among them - BOY
        PICKUP (Ogie Alcasid)! Legendary, enigmatic, hypnotic, that’s his appeal
        to most who don’t get what his works penetrate their heart just the
        same. Despite his underground fame and legend, Boy Pickup lives a normal
        and solitary life, He works as a pastry chef in Heaven’s Bakeshop, a
        bakery owned by ANGEL (Solenn Heussaff) and soon Angel feels indebted to
        Boy while Boy starts to fall for her.</image:caption
