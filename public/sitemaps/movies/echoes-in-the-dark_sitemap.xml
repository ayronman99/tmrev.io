        >A young woman in the middle of an economical crisis, a little girl who
        is facing a new environment and a loyal dog that will work as a link
        between both, will have to spend two nights in an old big house that is
        falling into pieces. Sounds at night and shadows accompanied with
        threatening echoes emerging from darkness are constant in the house.
        Will they be able to undergo the situation and solve the enigma that
        surrounds the presence that still rounds the house?</image:caption
