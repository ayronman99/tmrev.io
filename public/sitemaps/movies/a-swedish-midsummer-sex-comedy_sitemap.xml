        >A beautiful waterfront house, a Swedish flag fluttering in the wind. A
        sailboat tied to the wooden deck below. This is the setting of the
        friends' annual Midsummer celebrations. The friends are gathered at
        Emil's family house and the herring lunch, sauna, games and compulsory
        skinny dipping are as always prepared. Expectations are set - Micke
        worries about his highly pregnant wife and the fastest way to the
        nearest hospital. Eva is looking for some distraction from her recent
        split with Patrick and Sam. Emil's college buddy from the States arrives
        with his own expectations of Swedish sin. Wannabe singer-songwriter
        Anders hasn't told his wannabe pregnant girlfriend Maria about his low
        sperm count and hopes to solve the problem over the weekend. To top it
        off Emil's surprise seems to lift the party to unprecedented heights. If
        everything had gone according to plan that is.</image:caption
