        >Quick cash, fake diamonds, and a triple-cross... When an out of work
        Gulf War vet (Leo) is offered some quick cash as a bodyguard, he jumps
        at the chance. His job is to escort a diamond courier from the airport
        to a large wholesaler in L.A. ...simple enough. Unfortunately for Leo,
        the security boss (Sal) who hired him plans to steal the diamonds. Add
        two corrupt detectives and a disgruntled ex-jeweler all looking for the
        stones, Leo and company soon have nowhere to turn. Bad turns to worse
        when the "diamonds" turn out to be fake...and everyone wants what Leo
        doesn't have.</image:caption
