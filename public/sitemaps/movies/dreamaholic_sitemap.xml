        >A street performer, is chased by a rich and young film star coming to
        his home in her Mercedes SL. Her name is Ple and she likes older men.
        Getting interest from Ple is like a dream for Dang as he has been single
        since his wife died 10 years ago but he tries to abuse the situation.
        Meanwhile the reality is mixed with his own dreams. In his dreams, he is
        a film star. He is navigating between dream and reality not knowing
        which one is true. Dang behaves badly in his dreams when he is a film
        star.</image:caption
