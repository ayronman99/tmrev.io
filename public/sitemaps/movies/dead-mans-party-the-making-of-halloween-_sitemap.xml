        >In-depth Scream Factory documentary; one that doesn't sugarcoat any
        aspect of the production, from its rushed beginnings to the assembling
        of its cast and crew, its rocky production, and the many difficulties
        the filmmakers encountered along the way. Interviews with producer Malek
        Akkad, line producer Rick Nathanson, composer Alan Howarth and actors
        Danielle Harris, Ellie Cornell, Wedny Kaplan, Jeffrey Landman, Jonathan
        Chapin, Frankie Como, Tamara Glynn, Matthew Walker and Don Shanks (the
        fifth film's Michael Myers) are included. - blu-ray.com</image:caption
