        >The bond of brotherhood is always stronger when you can be pitched into
        a life and death situation at any time and the only thing that gets you
        through the inferno is the trust that your brother will have your back.
        The firefighters of Hong Kongâ€™s Pillar Point division who are expecting
        a quiet night to see off their retiring chief find their faith in each
        other stretched to the limits when a small fire at a liquor warehouse
        threatens to plunge the whole of Hong kong into darkness if it spreads
        to a nearby power plant supplying natural gas. Politics, rivalry, and
        suspicion all come into play when dubious decisions are made, warnings
        are ignored and colleagues start to fall. Can the Pillar Point
        brotherhood survive the night, if not the fire, with their trust in each
        other intact?</image:caption
