        >The documentary focuses on the plight of the bilby, a small big eared,
        long nosed unusual creature of the Australian outback that has been
        marginalised by rabbits, feral predators and humans. But there are two
        humans that put the bilby first and have gone on to capture the
        imagination of their local community, politicians, government bureaucrat
        and the wider population because they have single handedly turned the
        tables on an almost extinct species. Candy company Darrell Lea
        contributes a percentage of sales to Save the Bilby Fund, ($185,000AU to
        date) and the sanctuary has been built thanks to the chocolate eating
        Australian public and The Bilby Brothers, who have spent practically
        every waking moment of the past decade working to save this little
        oddball from extinction. Their work is a phenominal example of how one
        person CAN make a difference.</image:caption
