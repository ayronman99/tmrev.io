        >Young Chickenhare is the adopted son of King Peter, a famous
        adventurer. Part chicken and part hare, he has a really tough time
        growing up and disguises himself as a hare to avoid the mockeries of his
        peers. When the day of the Royal Adventurer Society trials comes,
        Chickenhare, hampered by his disguise, fails miserably. But he is
        determined to grab a second chance and find the Scepter of the Hamster
        of Darkness, before his evil Uncle Lapin. The Scepter will give immense
        power to its holder. If Lapin gets hold of it, he will be unstoppable.
        Accompanied by his faithful servant Abe, a sarcastic turtle, and Meg, a
        martial arts expert skunk, he sets of on an epic and initiatory
        quest.</image:caption
