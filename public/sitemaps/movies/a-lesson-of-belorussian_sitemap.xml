        >A documentary about young activists who never give up believing that
        Belarus will one day be free. Franek Viacorka studies at an elite school
        established by his father to promote the Belarusian language. However,
        the school has been banned and operating underground since 2003, a
        victim of the anti-democratic rule of President Alexander Lukashenko.
        Franek and his classmates are both passionate and thoughtful, expressing
        their critical attitude to the government by issuing an underground
        newspaper, recording music with activist lyrics and organizing an
        opposition concert.</image:caption
