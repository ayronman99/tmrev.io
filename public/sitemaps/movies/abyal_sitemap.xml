        >In the capital of Cameroon, Yaoundé, an urban maze built in concrete
        and earth, seven young musicians dedicate their lives to a dream: to
        give birth to Abyali Percusión. A musical project that aims to rescue
        traditional rhythms from oblivion, so that they do not get lost, and
        spread them around the world. They aspire to be able to live off their
        passion in a country where the record industry is non-existent and where
        theaters are scarce. Within this bleak panorama, after 2 years of
        intense work, facing serious economic difficulties, a possibility
        appears on the horizon, the Abok I N’goma dance and percussion festival.
        Tension mounts in the group as the date approaches; internal friction,
        annoyance with their mentor, Master Amadou Kienou, but they know that
        they can only keep working, because only work pays. Abyali is a vision
        of contemporary urban Africa narrated to the beats of drums, the same
        beats that fuel Abyali's Percussion dream.</image:caption
