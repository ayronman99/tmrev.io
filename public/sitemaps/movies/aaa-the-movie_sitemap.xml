        hands, the master of darkness' long lasting resentments resurge, thus
        threatening AAA's stability. With the help of Chesman, Charly Manson,
        and Cybernético, Abismo plots his revenge. Not even Octagón, AAA's
        spiritual leader, can stop the evil turn of events. When Kenzo Suzuki
        and Yonatan, Parka's younger brother, are kidnapped, it's quite clear
        the war has begun. Parka, helped by Gronda, Mascarita, Faby Apache, and
