        >Kristin Cooper, a talented assistant for a global PR firm, is put in
        charge of the annual Christmas fashion show and auction for clothing
        entrepreneur, Mr. Carson. A handsome young royal, Prince Patrick, is
        dispatched by his father, the King of Edgemoor, to be the face of the
        family co-sponsored event. Upon his arrival to Beverly Hills, Patrick
        meets Kristin and is instantly smitten with her, mistakenly thinking she
        is actually her boss, Melanie. While Patrick and Kristin spend the
        Christmas season together in California, she wonders if Patrick would
        have still fallen for her if he knew she was an assistant, and not the
        boss.</image:caption
