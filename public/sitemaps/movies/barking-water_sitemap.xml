        >Frankie is dying. Irene hasn't forgiven him. And they are racing
        against time to find their way home. Frankie needs help and Irene is the
        one he turns to. He must go home one last time. And, like so many times
        before, Irene is extending herself beyond her common sense. The two set
        out on a journey that becomes more than getting home; confronting the
        past, love, understanding, and self discovery. Barking Water is a tale
        of great love that looks at what brings us all together. It's a tale of
        home...and what it takes to get there.</image:caption
