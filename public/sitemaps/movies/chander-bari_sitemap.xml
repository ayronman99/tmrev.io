        >The Sanyals are a large extended family composed of the nonagenarian
        grandfather (Haradhan Banerjee), his son (Ranjit Mallick),
        daughter-in-law (Laboni Sarkar) and their children of whom two, a
        daughter (Koel Mallick) and a son (Rishi Kaushik), live together in a
        mansion in Bhawanipur. There seems to be more servants in their house
        than family members, extending the virtues and parameters of the ideal
        ‘joint’ family. The film starts with everyone being excited about the
        return of the elder son (Babul Supriyo) from the U.S., where he had gone
        for work. However, all hell breaks loose when he returns with a wife
        (Rituparna Sengupta) and her child from a former marriage in
        tow.</image:caption
