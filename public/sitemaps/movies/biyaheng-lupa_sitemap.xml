        >A bus takes-off from urban Manila to the rural southeastern side of the
        country, carrying a group of mixed passengers from all walks of life,
        each one has a personal story to tell and they are telling it in their
        own voice. During the long journey, as the passengers mentally sort out
        their past & their future, things happen in the present, by choice or by
        providence, that make their journey memorableâ€”the bus blows a tire, a
        song elicits tears, a butterfly causes commotion, a picture gets lost,
        someone's head is stoned, some hearts are broken, some mended. The bus
        ride poetizes the life journey and poses questions on issues of life and
        death and where exactly the line is drawn between free will and
        destiny.</image:caption
