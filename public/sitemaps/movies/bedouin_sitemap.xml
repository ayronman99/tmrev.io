        >Rita's daughter is sick with leukemia. In order to obtain the money for
        a bone marrow transplant, she travels from Ukraine to Russia to become a
        surrogate mother. The homosexual couple who are the biological parents
        of the child die in an automobile accident. Rita is left six month
        pregnant, without any money, and with a dying daughter to care for. In
        order to save her daughter, Rita is prepared to do anything. She's drawn
        into the criminal world, from which she escapes with her daughter to
        Jordan in the Near East, where Bedouins treat cancer by means of
        nontraditional medicines.</image:caption
