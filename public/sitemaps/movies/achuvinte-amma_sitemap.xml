        >Achuvinte Amma is a movie that tells the deep rooted relation between a
        mother, Vanaja and a daughter Achu. Vanaja is a street smart LIC agent
        who has made it on her own. She lives with her only daughter Aswathy
        alias Achu who holds a diploma in Civil Engineering. Mother and daughter
        share a special relationship and are like friends. There is nothing that
        Achu hides from her mother. But the only thing taboo in their life is
        the talk about her father. Vanaja never speaks about Achu's father and
        Achu never asks her as she doesn't want to hurt her beloved mother.
        Their life moves smoothly until Immanuel John alias Ijo enters their
        life. They meet Ijo accidentally when they go to Trivandrum for
        attending an interview. After the first meeting, Achu and Ijo run into
        each other now and then, and a friendship develops between
        them.</image:caption
