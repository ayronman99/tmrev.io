        >Beyond the human realm, there is a magical race of beings who control
        the tides and the changing of the seasons. One of these beings, a young
        girl named Chun, seeks something more—she wants to experience the human
        world! At sixteen, she finally gets her chance and transforms into a
        dolphin in order to explore the world that has her fascinated. But she
        soon discovers that it's a dangerous place and nearly gets killed in a
        vortex. Luckily, her life is spared when a young boy sacrifices himself
        to save her. Moved by his kindness and courage, she uses magic to bring
        him back to life only to learn that this power comes at a serious price.
        On a new adventure, she’ll have to make her own sacrifices in order to
        protect his soul until it is ready to return to the human
        world.</image:caption
