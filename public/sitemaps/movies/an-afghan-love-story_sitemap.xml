        >It’s snowing in Kabul, and gregarious waiter Mustafa charms a pretty
        student named Wajma. The pair begin a clandestine relationship—they’re
        playful and passionate but ever mindful of the societal rules they are

        family honor and his devotion to his daughter.</image:caption
