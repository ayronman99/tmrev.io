        >In a quiet Orlando, Florida, suburb three young men struggle to escape
        the wreckage of their pasts and create new lives for themselves. Their
        new home is CollegeBoysLive.com, a voyeur web cam house rigged with 32
        cameras, where their every move is watched by thousands of paying
        members. The site's creator claims CollegeBoysLive.com is simply about
        showing that "it's okay to be gay." But the neighbors insist it's a
        pornographic whorehouse and sue to have them evicted. This intimate and
        provocative documentary examines a complex subculture, but at its heart
        is the universal search for family and acceptance</image:caption
