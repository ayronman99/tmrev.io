        >He was a beloved American icon. Dean Martin, the coolest, the most
        debonair, the smoothest. This film is a loving and moving tribute to one
        of the most admired, idolized and accomplished entertainers the world
        has ever known. No other entertainer in history so thoroughly conquered
        the fields of recording, live performances, television and movies as did
        Dino, not even his good friend Frank Sinatra. Features footage and
        photos of Dean from throughout his life and career, as well as rare
        interview segments with Dean.</image:caption
