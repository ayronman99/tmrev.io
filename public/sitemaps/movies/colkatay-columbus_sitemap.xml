        >'Colkatay Columbus' is a satirical film which is set in present day,
        modern Kolkata. Where people are busy with their own lives and
        struggles, which leaves them in constant need of a rescuer or a hero who
        will be there for them in their time of need. In Colkatay Columbus,
        writer and director Saurav Palodhi has shown how everyone, from the
        ordinary person to a legend, is in search of something. The story
        unfolds through an encounter of Columbus and two boys in Kolkata. When
        Columbus somehow lands up in Kolkata in 2016, he is surprised to see
        that everyone is in search of something. He is in search of roads that
        would lead him back home while the boys are in search for Columbus to
        get him to offer tips on attaining success. Columbus starts doling out
        suggestions to the boys but is also put off by the
        “competition”.</image:caption
