        >Hiroshi Tanaka sports an intense perm which looks like the afro
        hairstyle favored by some African-Americans back in the 1970's. He
        doesn't get his hair done at a hair shop, he was actually born with his
        hair like that. For freedom, Hiroshi moves to Tokyo. He works hard there
        and, even though he turns 24, he still doesn't have a girlfriend.
        Meanwhile, a school friend informs Hiroshi that he is going to get
        married. Hiroshi remembers a promise that they made. Hiroshi is even
        more impatient to find a girlfriend. A beautiful woman named Aya Kato
        then moves into the neighborhood.</image:caption
