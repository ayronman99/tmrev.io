        >This fascinating documentary explores the collaboration between Marion
        Mahony, the first registered woman architect in the world and the
        longest serving designer in Frank Lloyd Wright’s practice, and husband
        Walter Burley Griffin. Their struggle with unyielding bureaucracy, the
        philosophies that underscored their life and work, and their passionate
        commitment to an architecture that expressed a balance between society
        and the environment and an affinity between the human spirit and the
        natural world. The film weaves together their personal and professional
        lives, drawing on archival and contemporary footage of their work, an
        extensive collection of photographs, the couple’s own correspondance and
        writing, and interviews with prominent architects, social historians and
        the people who knew them.</image:caption
