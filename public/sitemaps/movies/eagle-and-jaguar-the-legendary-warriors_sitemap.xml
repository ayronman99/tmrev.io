        >In a post-apocalyptic future in which water has almost disappeared, two
        young survivors travel back in time to find the mythical power of the
        prehispanic God of water, and so be able to create the vital resource.
        However, when they arrive at the present they discover that the power is
        in the hands of an unscrupulous businessman who had always wanted to
        monopolize water and who knows everything about prehispanic myths. The
        Aztaya brotherhood, a group of heroes, successors from the legendary
        Aztec and Mayan warriors, will begin the adventure to prevent the
        villain's plan and help the travelers to change their sad future,
        teaming up to fight the powerful enemy and his dark allies. To win, the
        heroes will have to awake the greatest warriors of Aztec and Mayan
        mythology: The Eagle and the Jaguar.</image:caption
