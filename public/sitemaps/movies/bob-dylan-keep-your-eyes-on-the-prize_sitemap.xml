        >This film traces the early career of Bob Dylan in a manner no other has
        ever attempted telling his tale from his birth in Duluth, Minnesota;
        through school and college; across his years as New Yorkâ€™s bright young
        starl, through to his electric phase, culminating with the controversial
        1966 world tour. Featuring interviews with a host of friends, colleagues
        and associates from that era, and numerous others, rare and often
        previously unseen footage, daring and outspoken contributions from the
        very finest Dylan writers [such as Derek Barker, CP Lee and Clinton
        Heylin] and a host of other features, this film is among the finest Bob
        Dylan documentaries yet to emerge.</image:caption
