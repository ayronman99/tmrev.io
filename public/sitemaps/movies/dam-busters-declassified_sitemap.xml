        >Martin Shaw takes a fresh look at one of the most famous war stories of
        them all. The actor, himself a pilot, takes to the skies to retrace the
        route of the 1943 raid by 617 Squadron which used bouncing bombs to
        destroy German dams. He sheds new light on the story as he separates the
        fact from the myth behind this tale of courage and ingenuity. Using the
        1955 movie The Dam Busters as a vehicle to deconstruct the raid, he
        tries to piece together a picture of perhaps the most daring attack in
        the history of aviation warfare.</image:caption
