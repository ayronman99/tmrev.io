        >What would a world look like that had a culture and an economic system
        that places human need above corporate greed, and how do we bring that
        world into being? Who cares what it is called. Call it Socialism, Call
        it Real Democracy Now, and Call it Chunky-Monkey-Cherry Garcia. The
        world needs to change radically, it needs to change dramatically, and it
        needs to change fast. This documentary is an invitation for you to
        participate in that positive change. Frankly, because, we need you. Yes,
        you.</image:caption
