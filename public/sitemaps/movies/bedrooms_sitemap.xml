        >Bedrooms tells a story about the walls that separate people, the
        heartbreak and infidelity that's often the result and the redemption
        that comes from tearing those walls down. The film is told in 4 stories
        by 3 filmmakers. Three of the stories deal with married couples of
        various ages confronting the turning points of their relationships. A
        fourth story is interwoven throughout, providing bookends and context in
        the form of a story about ten year old twins, who, tired of sharing
        their bedroom set out to build a wall between their beds to create their
        own spaces. In building the wall to separate, they come to fully
        appreciate all things that connect them. Bedrooms explores human
        relationships, their myriad complications and the daily choice we face
        to either make them work or to move on.</image:caption
