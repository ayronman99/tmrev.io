        >Mortimer Clark, a forensic pathologist finds himself autopsying yet
        another teenage girl’s body ravaged and torn by a large canine. The
        girls all have been slain on the full moon. A werewolf though? That’s
        ridiculous. But the next full moon is drawing near and another body is
        expected. Day of the full moon: Lauren Redd, a sixteen year old girl is
        being forced to spend the weekend with her grandmother. Here she steps
        into an elaborate trap laid out by a manipulative killer. But when
        Lauren’s finally cornered, the tables turn and the prey becomes the
        predator. Now the Redd family will go to any length to protect their
        daughter and hide their family secret but Mortimer is quickly following
        the trail that leads to the horrific truth: Werewolves do exist, and
        they have an appetite that must be satisfied.</image:caption
