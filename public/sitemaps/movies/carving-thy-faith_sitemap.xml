        >A five-year visual ethnography of traditional yet practical
        orchestration of Semana Santa in a small town where religious
        woodcarving is the livelihood. An experiential film on neocolonial
        Philippines’ interpretation of Saints and Gods through many forms of
        rituals and iconographies, exposing wood as raw material that undergoes
        production processes before becoming a spiritual object of devotion. - A
        sculpture believed to have been imported in town during Spanish colonial
        conquest, locally known as Mahal na Señor Sepulcro, is celebrating its
        500 years. Meanwhile, composed of non-actors, Senakulo re-enacts the
        sufferings and death of Jesus. As the local community yearly unites to
        commemorate the Passion of Christ, a laborious journey unfolds following
        local craftsmen in transforming blocks of wood into a larger than life
        Jesus crucified on a 12-ft cross.</image:caption
