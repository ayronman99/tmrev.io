        >Top photojournalist David Marshall endures a failed marriage rather
        than leave the children he loves. His wife Diane, abused in childhood,
        depressed, drinking and fearful, files unfounded charges of abuse and
        David's world shatters. Evicted, friendless, and emotionally battered,
        his career crumbles and the courts bar him from his children. David's
        struggle to rebuild his life carries him to brilliant psychiatrist,
        Rebecca Miller. She nurtures abused children but conceals her own
        shadowy secrets. Katherine Avery, gifted, idiosyncratic Downtown artist,
        offers David a refuge and shares her bed, but she'll sacrifice anything
        for success - even love. Despondent, David is drawn to cyber sex by
        submissive Internet incarnation, Sublimate. She uncovers his darkest
        fantasies but frees him to take control of his own life. When his Web
        fantasy woman enters his real life, the truth, especially about himself,
        becomes startlingly clear.</image:caption
