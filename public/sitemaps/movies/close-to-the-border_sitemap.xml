        >Esteban is a journalist who is escaping to the northern border. In the
        Buenos Aires of 1978, his life is in danger. The threats after one of
        his articles in the newspaper and his own inner conflicts push him to
        run away. But crossing the border is impossible. He comes back to a
        village near the frontier, where he stays at Father Gabriel's, a priest
        with ideas and attitudes of mind far from the traditional church. There
        he will meet Marina and Margarita, who will complete this human group
        with strong convictions. His stay there will be a definitive
        experience.</image:caption
