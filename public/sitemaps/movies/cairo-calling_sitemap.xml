        >Ahmed is in for the shock of his life when his mother calls from Cairo
        to announce her imminent visit to Montreal . He has to clean up his act
        to get ready for her arrival. He convinces his entourage to play along
        for the duration of her stay, telling them that the visit is a short
        one. But Mother has other plans... She is a woman on a mission and is
        ready to stay for as long as it takes for her to see it through. In
        fact, she has an open ticket! Ahmed's patience as well as his friends'
        will be severely tested as his mother tries to bring her old world
        values into their lives. But she too will get tested when she realizes
        the true meaning of the old saying : be careful what you wish for, it
        may just come true...</image:caption
