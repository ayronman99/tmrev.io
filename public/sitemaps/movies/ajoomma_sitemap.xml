        >A middle-aged widowed Singaporean woman named Auntie has spent the
        majority of her life providing for her family. As her adult son Sam
        becomes more independent, she is left to deal with a completely new
        identity outside of her roles as a daughter, wife, and mother. A solo
        vacation to Korea turns into a wild adventure when she meets Jung Su, an
        elderly security officer, and Kwon-Woo, a teenage tour guide who can't
        seem to get his life together. The trio embark on an unexpected roller
        coaster ride where hearts flutter and unlikely bonds are
        formed.</image:caption
