        >A true story, Bela Kiss was one of the the most brutal serial killers,
        who killed 23 young women during the beginning of the first World War.
        The blood-drained bodies were found in metal barrels, conserved in
        alcohol. According to rumors, he was still seen decades later, in
        different parts of the world. He never was found and so the whereabouts
        of this man are unknown, even today. Almost a century later, five bank
        robbers search for a hideaway in a remote hotel, as they flee from the
        police. Brutal and unforeseen events take overhand and build a bridge to
        the past. The assumed safe house turns into a nightmare... is Bela Kiss
        still alive?</image:caption
