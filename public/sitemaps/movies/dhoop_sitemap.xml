        >Right from Peon to Principal, and from the most lowly menial staff to
        the office of the Prime Minister, modern secular India is embedded in
        corruption by officials who brag that even if Mahatma Gandhi were to
        approach them to grant access to his very own Sabarmati Ashram, he would
        not be spared. In this era a honest man is defined as one who readily
        accepts a bribe and does the needful, while a dishonest man is one who
        accepts a bribe but refuses to do the needful. It is in this atmosphere
        that the Kapoor family live. Suresh, Peehu and a reluctant Sarita decide
        to call it "Kargil Heights" and go about obtaining the necessary
        documents to get it running, little knowing that the corrupt system will
        not permit them to take a step forward without bribing it's officers, of
        all ranks, who will refuse to issue any permit unless and until their
        palms are greased. Will Suresh, Sarita and Peehu ever be able to open
        "Kargil Heights", or will it just remain a dream?</image:caption
