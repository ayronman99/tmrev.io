        >Martin Ward is a cove fisherman, without a boat. His brother Steven has
        repurposed their fatherâ€™s vessel as a tourist tripper, driving a wedge
        between the brothers. With their childhood home now a getaway for London
        money, Martin is displaced to the estate above the picturesque harbour.
        As his struggle to restore the family to their traditional place creates
        increasing friction with tourists and locals alike, a tragedy at the
        heart of the family changes his world.</image:caption
