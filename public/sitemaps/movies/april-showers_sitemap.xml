        >April 1974 saw the fall of a long lasting dictatorship. The young
        democracy developed in the midst of much social and political turmoil.
        The armed wing of a leftist group changed the future of one family - the
        father disappears without trace, the mother denies their past, and the
        son grows up with unanswered questions. As a young man, Pedro is
        determined to reach for answers, aided by his apparently batty
        grandmother. Collecting clues and meeting people who would rather prefer
        to remain forgotten. His inner journey leads him Portugal to Spanish
        through the deserted roads of Alentejo. Pedro will find himself, but
        there is a price to pay.</image:caption
