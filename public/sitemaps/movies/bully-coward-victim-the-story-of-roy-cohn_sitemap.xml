        >Legendary and controversial attorney Roy Cohn was a power broker in the
        rough and tumble world of New York City business and politics. Senator
        Joseph R. McCarthy’s top counsel during investigations into Communist
        activities in the 1950s, Cohn is also known for being Donald Trump’s
        former personal lawyer, fixer and mentor. Focusing on key periods of his
        life, and drawing on extensive, newly unearthed archival material, a new
        documentary on Cohn’s life will debut on HBO in 2019.</image:caption
