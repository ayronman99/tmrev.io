        >﻿Alexis, a talented and proud student of the National Ballet School of
        Cuba, spends his life practicing chassé and entrechats with his
        girlfriend and dance partner Yelenia. However, when his family moves to
        Florida to be reunited with his sister, he must adjust his expectations
        and dreams to a radically new environment. Alexis, facing rejection and
        homesick for his native Cuba, feels lost and alone. He must find his way
        in the world of American ballet while remaining faithful to his
        roots.</image:caption
