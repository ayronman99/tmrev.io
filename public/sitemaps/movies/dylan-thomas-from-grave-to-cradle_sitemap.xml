        >Born in 1914, Dylan Thomas was an unruly and undisciplined child who
        was interested only in English at school and was determined from
        childhood to become a poet. Little did he know that he would eventually
        become world-renowned. The film unravels the myth by tracing the poet's
        biography backwards, from his much written about, much lied about death,
        to the heart of the Dylan Thomas story and his beginnings in a quiet
        street in suburban Swansea.</image:caption
