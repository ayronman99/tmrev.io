        >Nikki Crandon is one of the biggest pop stars on the planet. Whether
        she's singing the National Anthem or promoting her latest album,
        everyone knows who she isâ€”none more so than New Jersey high school
        basketball coach and widower Chris Mitchell, who was Nikki's first love
        in high school. When Chris' 10-year-old daughter Sophie finds out her
        dad still has feelings for the singer, she takes matters into her own
        hands. With her 8-year-old brother Jackson in tow, Sophie succeeds in
        reuniting the two. But when a misunderstanding and the growing glare of
        the public spotlight threaten Chris and Nikki's happiness, one can only
        wonder: will fame get in the way of a Merry Christmas?</image:caption
