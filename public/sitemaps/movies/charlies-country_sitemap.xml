        >Blackfella Charlie is getting older, and he's out of sorts. The
        intervention is making life more difficult on his remote community, what
        with the proper policing of whitefella laws that don't generally make
        much sense, and Charlie's kin and ken seeming more interested in going
        along with things than doing anything about it. So Charlie takes off, to
        live the old way, but in doing so sets off a chain of events in his life
        that has him return to his community chastened, and somewhat the
        wiser.</image:caption
