        >The most iconic battle in American History is looked at from the point
        of view of a man who may actually have survived the Battle of Little Big
        Horn. George Armstrong Custer and over 200 of his soldiers were wiped
        out by Plains Indians on June 25, 1876, but is it possible that one man,
        alone, lived to tell the tale? How did he survive? Why did he never come
        forward? And most important of all, is it true? The amazing tale of
        Frank Finkel is an epic story of struggle, perseverance, and survival
        and will shed new light on this historic moment.</image:caption
