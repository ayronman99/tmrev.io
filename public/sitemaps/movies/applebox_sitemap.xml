        >James Bronson is a Hollywood Mega Star. He's at the top of his game --
        and the top of his box. A full apple box, to be exact. At the height of
        his stardom, an unfortunate mishap occurs and Bronson loses his trusted
        box -- all that 'makes' the 5 foot 3 inch actor a larger-then-life
        phenom quickly disappears. In this short little comedy, we follow how a
        vertically challenged actor rises to the occasion when opportunity finds
        him in his most pivotal state, learning that the true foundation beneath
        his craft isn't necessarily a 2x1 foot box.</image:caption
