        >Suellen (Thalita Carauta) is a cook who works hard to keep her little
        son, her younger sister and her mother alone. One day, your dreams come
        true: she splits in two. Her copy, identical physically, has different
        personality, being much more extroverted and courageous. The idea would
        be to divide the tasks with the other one, but soon Suellen realizes
        that the look-alike has plans of its own, and decides to betray the
        original.</image:caption
