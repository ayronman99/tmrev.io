        >Snoop stars as a grocery clerk named Cordé Christopher, a young and
        magnetic man, subject to keen female interest. He becomes a protégé of
        Orange Juice, an experienced pimp, after being informed of the better
        and richer life he can lead if he becomes a pimp. OJ cultivates Cordé's
        'talent' and shares street knowledge with him, including the Rules of
        the "Pimping" Game. To some degree OJ treats Corde like a son. After
        achieving success Cordé has to choose between the love of his life,
        Chardonnay Allen, and his successful career as a pimp.</image:caption
