        >This is a documentary about some actor performing in a reverse
        performance at a gay bar in Chengdu. In reverse, men perform women's
        roles in women's clothing. The reverse actors in the film all have
        different sexual orientations from ordinary people. They are the
        marginal group of the marginal group gay. They performed roles different
        from their own gender on the stage, lived differently from ordinary
        people on stage, and pursued their freedom and happiness in their own
        way.</image:caption
