        >It takes BALLS to win. At least that's what the local bowling clubs in
        idyllic Warroad, Minnesota used to say, before Emily came along. Now
        that she has returned to resurrect her name on the champion's board,
        Gunnar and the boys in town are polishing up their equipment for another
        shot at the title. This screwball ensemble mockumentary captures Emily's
        return from retirement, to avenge her loss to Gunnar, and bring justice
        to her family name. It's gutter-ball madness where split
        happens.</image:caption
