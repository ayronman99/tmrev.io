        >Set in a near-future world where there is no privacy, ignorance or
        anonymity, our private memories are recorded and crime almost ceases to
        exist. In trying to solve a series of unsolved murders, Sal Frieland
        stumbles onto a young woman who appears to have subverted the system and
        disappeared. She has no identity, no history and no record. Sal realizes
        it may not be the end of crime but the beginning. Known only as 'The
        Girl', Sal must find her before he becomes the next
        victim.</image:caption
