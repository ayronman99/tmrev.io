        >13 year old Coco loves fashion and has her own unique style. She dreams
        of becoming a famous fashion icon. But on her first day of school she is
        made fun of and everyone calls her 'Coco the Clown'. Devastated, she
        decides to leave her vintage dresses, panther boots and striped socks at
        home and to dress herself more unnoticeable. Her anonymously kept
        fashion vlog as Style Tiger is a huge hit however. Is there still a
        chance that she will become a style icon? And does Bruno, that quirky
        boy she knows from school and secretly likes, finally notice her? Slowly
        Coco learns that she just has to be 100% herself!</image:caption
