        >Sergey Nikonenko directs this charming comedy inspired by three short
        stories ("The Insult," "At Night in the Boiler Room" and "Greetings to
        the Grey One") and an unfinished book by Russian writer, actor and
        filmmaker Vasily Shukshin. The character study follows the occupants of
        a drunk tank, who, after awakening to find themselves temporarily
        incarcerated, proceed to recount the events that led them to their
        present situation.</image:caption
