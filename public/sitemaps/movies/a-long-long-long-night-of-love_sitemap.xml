        >Reporter Marcello has a brief encounter with Irene while waiting for a
        train. A young woman who has lost her sight finds herself falling for
        the voice of a ship's captain she hears over a radio broadcast. Egle, a
        massage therapist who is soon to be married, finds herself pursuing one
        last fling with Gabriele -- though the odds are not in her favor, since
        he happens to be gay. Elena is a young woman with a child who wants to
        abandon her husband. And Carla wonders if she has any future at all with
        her lover -- who is married to someone else.</image:caption
