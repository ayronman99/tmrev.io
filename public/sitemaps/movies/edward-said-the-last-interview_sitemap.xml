        >Prominent Columbia University English and Comparative Literature
        professor Edward Said was well known in the United States for his
        tireless efforts to convey the plight of the Palestinian people, and in
        this film shot less than a year before his death resulting from
        incurable leukemia, the author of such books as {-Orientalism},
        {-Culture and Imperialism}, and {-Power, Politics, and Culture}
        discusses with filmmakers his illness, his life, his education, and the
        continuing turmoil in Palestine. Diagnosed with the disease in 1991,
        Said struggled with his leukemia throughout the 1990s before refraining
        from interviews due to his increasingly fragile physical state. This
        interview was the one sole exception to his staunch "no interview"
        policy, and provides fascinating insight into the mind of the man who
        became Western society's most prominent spokesman for the Palestinian
        cause.</image:caption
