        >Eve is an emergency medical technician who falls in love with Damien
        (Sagamore St√©venin), a handsome and caring man who runs a neighborhood
        bar in the Belgian countryside. When Damien and Eve become a couple, she
        joins him in looking after the bar and becomes friendly with the regular
        customers, but things take an unexpected turn when Eve is in a serious
        auto accident. While Eve walks away with no serious physical injuries,
        she's emotionally ravaged by the experience, and develops a severe
        speech impediment. Eve's new stutter makes it hard for her to
        communicate with Damien and she becomes the butt of jokes from the
        customers. Eve is increasingly isolated and Damien takes up with another
        woman until Eve retaliates by trapping him in their home and forces him
        to re-establish the building blocks of their relationship, starting with
        their sexual communication. Meanwhile, Eve's struggle to speak is
        contrasted with one of the tavern's annual events, an animal calling
        contest.</image:caption
