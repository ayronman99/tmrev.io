        >Vincent, still of tender age, has already tattooed most of his body and
        hoarsened his voice with his post-hardcore band – his way of venting his
        frustrations and desires. Ever since his mother died, he shares his time
        between Porte de Clignancourt and Bastille, between a piercer job he is
        unhappy with and his fishmonger father, Hervé, who is trying to start a
        new life with a younger woman named Julia. Vincent is initially appalled
        by the woman, with whom his father has ‘betrayed’ his mother, but the
        more they get to know each other, the more he becomes intrigued by the
        beautiful and empathetic woman. Unlike his father, she shows interest in
        him, even attending one of his gigs. What starts out as a potential way
        of reconciling with his father soon implodes.</image:caption
