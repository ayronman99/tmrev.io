        >Frustrated with the traditional school system, a family in Los Angeles
        pulls their two children out of one of the highest-rated schools in the
        area and takes their education into their own hands. In the quest to
        better their children's lives, they must ovecome long-standing
        assumptions about education and face the social ramifications of their
        bold decision. Class Dismissed will challenge viewers to take a fresh
        look at what it means to be educated in the 21st century and offer up a
        radical new way of thinking about the process of
        learning.</image:caption
