        >A real-life zombie epidemic is spreading. Inspired by the increasing
        popularity of zombie movies and television shows, men, women, and
        children across the globe use gruesome makeup and costumes to become a
        rotting mass of zombies staggering through city streets. Featuring
        interviews with Norman Reedus, Academy Award®-winning makeup artist, and
        director Tom Savini—who provides new insights into his collaboration
        with the godfather of zombie cinema, George Romero — Dead Meat Walking
        is a fun and riveting documentary that offers a unique focus into the
        extraordinary and ghoulish pastime that has devoured the imaginations of
        zombie fans.</image:caption
