        >The Kazankirans, a Kurdish family from Turkey, came to Japan seeking
        asylum, but the Japanese government would not grant them official
        refugee status. In desperation, the family stages a sit-in demonstration
        in front of the United Nations University. The Kazankirans' spirited
        fight motivates film student Masaru Nomoto to drop out of school in
        order to document their story. However, contrary to the principle of
        non-refoulement, the father and eldest son of the family get deported in
        2005. Unable to continue being a passive observer, the then 21-year-old
        director follows them to Turkey, where he engages with locals and
        discovers new perspectives about the Kurdish people and
        identity.</image:caption
