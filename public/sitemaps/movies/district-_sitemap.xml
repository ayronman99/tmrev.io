        >Thirty years ago, aliens arrive on Earth. Not to conquer or give aid,
        but to find refuge from their dying planet. Separated from humans in a
        South African area called District 9, the aliens are managed by
        Multi-National United, which is unconcerned with the aliens' welfare but
        will do anything to master their advanced technology. When a company
        field agent contracts a mysterious virus that begins to alter his DNA,
        there is only one place he can hide: District 9.</image:caption
