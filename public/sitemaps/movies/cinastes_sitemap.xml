        >Is there such a thing as strictly feminine cinema? Is it more difficult
        for a woman than for a man to direct a film? Is gender parity necessary
        in the industry? Actress and producer Julie GAYET and actor and director
        Mathieu BUSSON ask these questions to twenty French woman filmmakers,
        who face a camera together for the first time. After over an hour of
        lively, informal, spontaneous and funny interviews, it becomes obvious
        that these issues are still problematic and definitely worthy of a
        documentary. As Mia HANSEN-LØVE remarks, “In the eyes of the people, a
        woman’s film is always a woman’s film, while a man’s movie is simply… a
        movie”.</image:caption
