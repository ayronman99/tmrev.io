        >At the dinner table sits a white family: the father (a police officer),
        a mother and their two sons—a teenager and his younger brother. The
        teenager has an African-American friend, J.B., whom he wants to hang out
        with, but his father doesn’t want him leaving the house to meet up with
        J.B.—and especially not at night. “I want to keep you from bad
        situations,” the father explains to his son—an eerie foretelling, but
        more important, indicative of the violence that this white man
        associates with all black boys, even J.B., a black boy he knows
        personally and considers to be “a good kid.”</image:caption
