        >Faiz has a pregnant wife. He lives with his father-in-law and his
        brother-in-law Nazrul in a village. Faiz has no permanent job. Then he
        made his source of income by stealing the property of the villagers. It
        was a scandal and a disgrace to the family. His father-in-law always
        advised him to change. Even so, Faiz is still in a bad mood without any
        intention to change. As a result, Faiz escaped to the city. In the city
        he is caught up in many other dirty works. He enjoyed making the mistake
        while living in a city where no one could monitor his actions. But one
        day everything changed. It was all because almost every night he had
        nightmares that his death day was approaching. Faiz became uncertain and
        eventually decided to repent and study religion.</image:caption
