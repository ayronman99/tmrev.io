        >In a city of darkness, they are the light. From some of the world's
        most visionary animators comes an action-packed, feature-length
        adventure of two young warriors in the battle between the forces of good
        and evil! Kira and Eli are the newest members of the Guardian Force, a
        group of angel warriors sworn to protect the world from the powers of
        evil. Not yet full Guardians, the young duo still has a lot to learn,
        but when darkness descends over the city, the time for training is over.
        Faced with the responsibility of delivering hope to a lost city, they
        must learn to work together to drive back the soldiers of darkness and
        grow into the warriors they are destined to become.</image:caption
