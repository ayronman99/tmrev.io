        >Beth, Milena, and Carina are three college students who've shared some
        of Rio's most wild and legendary parties for the past few semesters.
        After living in New York for a year, Beth returns on New Year's Eve a
        changed girl, willing to mend her ways and grow up. Milena and Carina,
        however, are not happy about their friend's change - Keen on stopping
        Beth form becoming "respectable" at all costs, they show up at her house
        with dozens of friends to celebrate the New Year. Before dawn, secrets
        will be revealed, friendships will be tested, hearts will broken, and
        tears (and other bodily fluids) will be spilled. As the night unfolds,
        we also witness past events in a seedy nightclub, which changed the
        lives of those three girls forever.</image:caption
