        >Parents who don't want to take care of their child leave parenting to
        the mail ordered robot "Auto Mommy" and allow their child to be raised
        in isolation. One day, they take a look at the monitor to check the
        child, and then they see the child wearing dog skin and hiding his face.
        This is not good, the parents think, because they can't send the child
        to school like this. So they make Auto Mommy peel the dog skin off the
        child, only to find that the child became a plant without a human
        face.</image:caption
