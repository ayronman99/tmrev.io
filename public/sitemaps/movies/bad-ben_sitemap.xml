        >Tom Riley thought he was getting the deal of a lifetime when he bought
        a house below market value at a Sheriff's sale. He invested every penny
        he had with the plan of flipping the home for a profit. Once he owned
        it, however, he noticed strange happenings, all of which were captured
        on 21 Surveillance Cameras located throughout the home inside and out.
        At first, he thought people were breaking in, but he soon realized he
        was dealing with something Paranormal.</image:caption
