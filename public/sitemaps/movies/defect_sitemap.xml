        >New from the makers of Universe and Universe 2: Dan Heaton of Syko
        Productions introduces Defect, the DVD. See a handful of world-class
        riders demonstrate the latest innovations in street, mountain and trials
        unicycling. Defect combines groundbreaking filmmaking with a fresh
        soundtrack and bonus rider commentary, to showcase the skills and
        personalities of this rapidly emerging sport. Highly technical and
        highly entertaining, this video features some gee-whiz riding that will
        make you wince many times. Dan Heaton's skill as a filmmaker is as
        outrageous as his riding. Released on DVD in 2005, Defect became the
        most popular full-length unicycle highlight film to date. Building on
        the street and trials riding featured in previous films (UNiVERsE -
        2000, UNiVERsE 2 - 2004), it also introduced the beginnings of flat-land
        unicycling.</image:caption
