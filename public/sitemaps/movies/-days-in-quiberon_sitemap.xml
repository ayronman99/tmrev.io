        >1981, Quiberon, a small village on the coast of Brittany, France. Hilde
        Fritsch arrives to visit her old friend who has retreated to a spa hotel
        to escape the daily pressures of her life. Her friend is world-famous
        star Romy Schneider, but together, they appear like two regular women
        who are just happy to be reunited. Yet it quickly becomes apparent that
        Hilde is supposed to offer the support the sensitive actress needs to be
        able to truly face her own demons.</image:caption
