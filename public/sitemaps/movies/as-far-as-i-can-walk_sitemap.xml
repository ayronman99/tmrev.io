        >Strahinja and his wife Ababuo left Ghana with a dream of a better life
        in Europe. Instead of reaching the western part of the continent, they
        were deported back to Serbia. Strahinja has started to build himself a
        career, while Ababuo is unable to fulfil her ambitions and she feels
        increasingly frustrated. When she disappears one day, Strahinja sets out
        to find her… A crystal clear, humanistic story about the need to find
        one’s place in the world. It’s also a tale of love, the most profound
        testimony of which might also be the most painful.</image:caption
