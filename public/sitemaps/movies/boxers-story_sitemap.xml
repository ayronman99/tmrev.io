        >Wah Sang was a boxing champion seven years ago. He now works at a
        garage and cares for his seven-year-old son Henry. They live a small
        apartment and Wah spends much of his time gambling and drinking. Henry
        wants Wah, whom he addresses by that name him to return to boxing, but
        Wah is hesitant because he suffered a brain injury.</image:caption
