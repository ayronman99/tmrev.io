        >Maya is a quick-witted young woman who comes over the Mexican border
        without papers and makes her way to the LA home of her older sister
        Rosa. Rosa gets Maya a job as a janitor: a non-union janitorial service
        has the contract, the foul-mouthed supervisor can fire workers on a
        whim, and the service-workers' union has assigned organizer Sam Shapiro
        to bring its "justice for janitors" campaign to the building. Sam finds
        Maya a willing listener, she's also attracted to him. Rosa resists, she
        has an ailing husband to consider. The workers try for public support;
        management intimidates workers to divide and conquer. Rosa and Maya as
        well as workers and management may be set to collide.</image:caption
