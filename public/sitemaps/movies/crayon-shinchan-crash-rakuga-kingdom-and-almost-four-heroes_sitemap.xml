        >The kingdom that floats above in the sky, that uses free doodles as an
        energy source, “Rakuga Kingdom.” However, now in the face of a lack in
        energy, they are on the brink of ruin. In order to force the creation of
        doodles, the kingdom’s army begins its attack on Kasukabe on the
        surface! Meanwhile, as the drawings begin to move, the hero who is
        bestowed the hidden treasure of the kingdom, the “Miracle Crayon”—is
        none other than the “super happy-go-lucky 5-year-old,” Nohara
        Shinnosuke!! Together as the “Almost Four Heroes,” Shinnosuke and the
        drawn doodles try to take back Kasukabe! Amongst that, they discover the
        weakness of the doodles, where they dissolve upon contact with water! To
        make matters worse, a raincloud that looks to start pouring at any
        moment hovers above… What awaits their encounter with the doodles and
        the end of their adventure—will it be smiles, or tears!?</image:caption
