        >In the middle of the Siberian taiga, 450 miles from the nearest
        village, live two families : the Braguines and the Kilines. Not a single
        road leads there. A long trip on the Ienissei River, first by boat, then
        by helicopter, is the only way to reach Braguino. Self-sufficient, both
        families live there according to their own rules and principles. In the
        middle of the village: a barrier. The two families refuse to speak. In
        the river sits an island, where another community is being built : that
        of the children. Free, unpredictable, wild. Stemming from the fear of
        the other, that of wild beasts, and the joy procured by the immensity of
        the forest, unravels a cruel tale in which tensions and fear give shape
        to the geography of an ancestral conflict.</image:caption
