        >Dolores Claiborne was accused of killing her abusive husband twenty
        years ago, but the court's findings were inconclusive and she was
        allowed to walk free. Now she has been accused of killing her employer,
        Vera Donovan, and this time there is a witness who can place her at the
        scene of the crime. Things look bad for Dolores when her daughter
        Selena, a successful Manhattan magazine writer, returns to cover the
        story.</image:caption
