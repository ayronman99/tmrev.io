        >Rez lost his wife sometime in the past, now he is a man abandoned by
        society, trying to survive, and provide for his daughter. He possesses a
        gift: the perfect photographic memory, but having perfect recall isn't
        all it's cracked up to be. He finds himself involved with dangerous
        people from his past who persuade him into testing their stolen time
        machine "Titus" that has the ability to send someone hours into the
        future. When he leaps forward in time and witnesses a nuclear explosion,
        he returns to his own time and has only eight hours to discover the
        cause and save the city from destruction.</image:caption
