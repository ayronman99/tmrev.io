        >"Homosexuality, this painful problem "... It was thirty years ago, the
        title of a program of Ménie Grégoire! But what has happened since the
        seventies, when France was transformed and the gay movement emerged? For
        gays and lesbians, thirty years of fights, hopes and despairs, thirty
        years of parties, sufferings and mournings, victories and emancipation.
        Thirty revolutionary years, pink and black, on which Yves Jeuland has
        examined, in an approach that is at once documentary, historian and
        ethnographer. First part: "Red years" (1971/1979) "Pink years"
        (1979/1984) Second part "Black years" (1983/1991) "Rainbow years"
        (1992/2002)</image:caption
