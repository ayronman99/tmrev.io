        >Pierre, in his thirties, is a breeder of dairy cattle. His life
        revolves around his farm, his veterinarian sister and his parents whose
        livestock he took over. As the first cases of a zoonotic outbreak are
        reported in France, Pierre discovers that one of his animals is
        infected. He cannot cope with the perspective of losing the whole herd.
        They are everything he has and he will do whatever it takes to save
        them.</image:caption
