        >The summer of '58, the year Sweden almost won the world championship in
        soccer over Brazil, Yngve Johansson accepts two children to live with
        him during the summer, as told through the eyes of a young boy. His name
        is MÃ¥rten, and the other child's name is Annika. She is a rough girl,
        with many problems. The three of them do not get along, and Yngve is a
        true dictator to the children's eyes. However, when the children
        discover that their new guardian has a crush on their teacher (Cecilia
        Nilsson), they do what they can to bring the two together. Soon enough,
        the three will discover that they have a lot more in common than they
        previously imagined, and together they can make their lives worth living
        again. This is a sweet story about life in Sweden in the mid 1900's. It
        is about family, love, hate, innocent friendship that we all can relate
        to, and much, much more...</image:caption
