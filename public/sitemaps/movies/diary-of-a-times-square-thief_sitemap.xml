        >Diary of a Times Square Thief documents a journey of discovery: the
        search for the writer of a mysterious diary that the filmmaker found on
        Ebay. This manuscript describes the adventures of a young man who, in
        the late eighties, left the Midwest of the United States to go to New
        York to realize his big dream: to find a publisher for his work and
        become a writer. He fails, and the diary gives a frank and confronting
        account of the author's subsequent downfall. This is where the diary
        ends; its last pages have been cut out with a knife. Diary of a Times
        Square Thief consists of small, intimate portraits of some of the
        colorful characters described in the diary, who could have known its
        writer. Through these encounters clarity gradually emerges about the
        fate of the talented but failed author, and about the value of chasing
        dreams. In addition, the film paints a vivid picture of the world-famous
        Times Square area when it was still a dramatically brutal urban
        jungle.</image:caption
