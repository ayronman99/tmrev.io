        >On the 29th lunar New Year's Eve of the twelfth lunar month of a
        certain year, it was getting late in Guangzhou. A trance-looking boy
        drove through the urban jungle, wandering alone on the streets, waiting
        to meet his girlfriend a few years ago, expecting a result to happen. In
        an old town, a middle-aged woman brought a girl along the street to beg
        for food. At the gate of a certain community, they encountered a
        middle-aged man who was driving around after drinking and eating. The
        man invited them to have a barbecue at a roadside stall and made a
        suggestion. In a hospital, two security guards were bored at the gate.
        After work, I decided to go to a certain village in a city and village
        to win money after work. Unexpectedly, the night was getting thicker and
        the flow of people was surging. The Spring Festival Gala is going on
        grandly, and the air is full of noise and anxiety, three realities
        Event, tearing apart the absurd reality of the crazy
        city•••</image:caption
