        >The children in a religious family clash with their parents as they
        prepare for the wake of their brother, Mitchel. Teenage Mason
        desperately tries to reach his lost identical twin through spiritual
        means. Precocious preteen Molly meticulously organizes the event
        expecting everything to go exactly as planned. Megan, their older
        sister, returns home after a long absence, no longer interested in
        repressing the truth. Their Baptist grandmother and parents attempt to
        maintain normalcy when an unexpected stranger, Jameson, arrives --
        forcing the family to face secrets and lies around Mitchel's
        death.</image:caption
