        >In God We Trust, Inc.: The Lost Tapes is VHS/DVD of the Dead Kennedys'
        first recording session of their EP, In God We Trust Inc.. It was
        released in July 2003. The session was filmed in June 1981 by Eric
        Goodfield for a part of a punk documentary he was making. When the DKs
        went to master the tape it started to peel and deteriorate, so they had
        to record it again (that session took place in August and was used for
        the EP). The tape was in Goodfield's collection until the DKs asked him
        if he would release the video as part of their 25th anniversary. It
        includes live versions of all the songs except "Hyperactive Child", for
        which no live footage could be found.</image:caption
