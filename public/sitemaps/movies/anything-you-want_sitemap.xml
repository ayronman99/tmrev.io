        >Leo is immediately set adrift by his new found responsibilities as a
        single parent, a feeling that is made doubly distressing when Dafne,
        herself understandably confused and heartbroken by her mother's absence,
        asks for an "artificial" mother to help her fall asleep at night. It is
        here that Ma√±as takes the road less traveled, but to write any more
        about the plot line he introduces would be unfair to both the viewer and
        filmmaker alike. Suffice it to say that Leo's actions are both
        surprising and potentially dangerous, as they require Leo to subsume his
        own identity to the point where he nearly loses it.</image:caption
