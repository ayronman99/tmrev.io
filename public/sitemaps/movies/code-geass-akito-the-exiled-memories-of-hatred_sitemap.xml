        >While W-0 is away, Leila and the remaining crew at base find themselves
        surrounded by Britannian Knightmares. Piloting the Vercingetorix, Shin
        Hyuuga leads the enemy charge, having usurped the position of Grand
        Master in the Knights of St. Michael. With her core members unavailable,
        it's up to Leila to protect her comrades, but this may be much tougher
        than she realizes: a spy lurking among them is finally ready to reveal
        himself. Left with no choice but to surrender, Leila arranges a meeting
        with Shin in order to ensure the safety of her squad. But as
        negotiations begin to fall apart, Akito and an unexpected ally return in
        the nick of time to turn things around.</image:caption
