        >Slavery has always been part of Sudan's history, but in recent years it
        has become a new means in Sudanese warfare. Focuses on the moral dilemma
        aid organisations are faced with in Southern Sudan. For more then 17
        years Africa's largest country is crippled by civil war between the
        Islamic North and the Christian-animistic South. Over 2 million people
        died during this conflict. One of its horrible consequences is the
        revival of slavery. Slavery has always been part of Sudan's history, but
        in recent years it has become a new means in Sudanese
        warfare.</image:caption
