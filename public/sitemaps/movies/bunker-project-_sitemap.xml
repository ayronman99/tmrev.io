        >At the height of the Cold War, Russia was working on a secret
        scientific mission, which, if successful, would have changed the course
        of history. The mission, "Project 12," was ultimately deemed too
        dangerous to continue and the scientists involved were to be
        exterminated. Three scientists escaped and Project 12 was sealed in a
        well-guarded bunker, never to be seen again...until now. The lead
        scientist for Project 12 has now become the target of a worldwide
        manhunt, as he is the lone survivor of the Project 12 team and is the
        only man who knows the secrets that have been buried in the bunker. What
        secret does he possess, and who is financing the operation to bring
        Project 12 back to life and what is their hidden agenda</image:caption
