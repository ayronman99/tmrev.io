        >A photographer sets off toward a mysterious forest to find Boychuk,
        witness and victim of the Great Fire that swept through Northern Ontario
        at the turn of the 20th century. But before she arrives, she learns that
        Boychuck has just perished. Survivors of the long-ago fire, Tom and
        Charlie, two elderly men who have chosen to live out their last days in
        the woods, are introduced to Marie Desneige, whose 60 year
        institutionalization has only fueled her passion for life. Meanwhile,
        the photographer is discovering that Boychuck had been a painter, whose
        lifeâ€™s work had been entirely inspired by the Great Fire. The story
        immerses us in a historical drama while captivating us with the strange
        lives of these men of the forest. Three men who, in choosing freedom
        above all else, made a deal with death.</image:caption
