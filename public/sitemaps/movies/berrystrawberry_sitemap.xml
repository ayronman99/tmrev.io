        >Maxim from the village of Gondyrgurt is in love with a young singer
        Victoria Yadygarova, whose songs he heard on the radio. In the city, at
        an Udmurt party, he finally sees an Udmurt star, but immediately loses
        hope of meeting - the metropolitan beauty is taken away by her lover in
        a cool foreign car. Maxim's sister and grandfather are seriously puzzled
        by the task of saving Maxim from depression. With the help of recently
        returned from the army Mitreya and friends, they go to the producer
        Vika, Udmurt hipster Robert and lure them to the village for a concert.
        This is where the relationship between Maxim and Vika
        begins.</image:caption
