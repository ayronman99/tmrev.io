        >2003 was a big year for AC/DC which included their induction into the
        Rock and Roll Hall of Fame to European dates with the Rolling Stones,
        the band made several high-profile public appearances (including the
        SARS concert in Toronto for 200,000 people). One run of shows found the
        band returning to their roots and playing clubs and theaters where fans
        were treated to sweaty, stripped-down shows and even playing some
        rarities they hadn't played in years. This DVD show from Munich, Germany
        was filmed at Circus Krone 2003 and this disc only available on the
        Deluxe Edition.</image:caption
