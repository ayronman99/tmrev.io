        >Lynne Sachs spends a winter morning in Central Park shooting film in
        the snow. Holding her Super 8mm camera, she takes note of graphic
        explosions of dark and light and an occasional skyscraper. The stark
        black lines of the trees against the whiteness create the sensation of a
        painter's chiaroscuro. Woven into this cinematic landscape, we hear
        sound artist Stephen Vitiello's delicate yet soaring musical track which
        seems to wind its way across the frozen ground, up the tree trunks to
        the sky. — “I spent a morning this winter in Central Park shooting film
        in the snow. The stark black lines of the trees against the whiteness
        creates the sensation of a painter’s chiaroscuro, or a monochromatic
        ‘tableau-vivant.’ When I am holding my super 8mm camera, I am able to
        see these graphic explosions of dark and light” (Lynne
        Sachs).</image:caption
