        >Two young people in their twenties, Lilian and André, decide to escape
        the dreary holiday season and go to the paradise that is supposed to be
        Spain. During their aimless journey, the couple naively places their
        trust in a shady guy named Sylvester. Although he is a little older than
        the two lovers, Sylvester also tries to give some semblance of meaning
        to his life by becoming acquainted with the hackneyed myths of our
        mediatized world: road movies, war games, romantic stories, drift into
        drugs. By agreeing to play roles based on clichés, the trio are
        gradually mired in a dangerous conflict over trust and confidence, love
        and life.</image:caption
