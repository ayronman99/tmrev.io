        >December in Hamburg: The city shines in the lights, the people meet at
        the Christmas markets. Jule has her law exam at last in her pocket and a
        plan for her life. It should be a job in a non-governmental
        organization, then someday the man and also children. On the nightly
        journey home from her birthday and graduation party organized by her
        friend Lexa, she meets Santa Claus at the Elbe. It will take four years
        of ups and downs before they both understand, accept and feel it at the
        same time: that life will never feel right without each
        other.</image:caption
