        >Shielding his family from a looming misfortune, Virgilio de los Reyes
        keeps appearances through the aid of crystal methamphetamine. Virgilio
        and his wife received Jay Juanillo as their tenant to occupy one of the
        houses in their compound. Jay, who himself is trying to escape the
        realities of his life with his wife and a young male lover, settles in
        and builds relations with the delos Reyes family. From the seeming
        idyllic setting, Jay witnesses the slow implosion of the delos Reyes
        family and gets tangled in the power struggle within the compound. As
        Virgilio's paranoia escalates, Jay becomes an easy target, a scapegoat
        of Virgilio's inability to distinguish reality and hallucination. When
        their strategies of escape break down and reality catches up with them,
        the violence outside the gates finds its way into the
        compound.</image:caption
