        >After quitting school and being fired from every possible job Bowser
        shocks his parents with an unexpected News Flash. "Mom , Dad, I know
        what I am going to be, I want to be a porn director". Dad freaks out Mom
        freaks out and we are all off to a good start. Now all Bowser and his
        partner in crime need is a simple thing called money. No problem! After
        mortgaging his parents house, then losing the cash on the train, only to
        see it pop up on the evening news, the boys go to the mob as the last
        resort. This is a royal mess. A comedy with more twists and turns then a
        Chicago Pretzel.</image:caption
