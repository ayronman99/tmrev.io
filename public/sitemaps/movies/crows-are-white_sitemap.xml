        >For over a thousand years, a secretive Buddhist sect has lived on an
        isolated monastery in Japan performing acts of extreme physical
        endurance in their pursuit of enlightenment. A filmmaker, struggling to
        reconcile his desires with his faith, sets off to the strict monastery
        in search of answers. When he arrives, his presence is not welcomed and
        the only monk who will speak with him is an outcast who prefers ice
        cream and Slayer to meditation. Together they forge an unlikely
        friendship that leads them to higher truths and occasionally, a little
        trouble. Shot over five years on three continents, Crows are White is an
        exploration of truth, faith and love, from the top of a mountain to the
        bottom of a sundae.</image:caption
