        >Sakura obtained both the light and dark cards after facing off against
        Eriol–the reincarnation of Clow Reed–at Tokyo Tower. Just when Sakura
        thought her life had returned to normal, it turns out that Eriol will be
        returning to England… Though a bit sad, Sakura sees him off. After being
        told “I’m in love with you” by Li Shaoran, Sakura doesn’t even
        understand her own feelings. Tomoyo gently gives her the courage she
        needs, but before she’s able to get her feelings into order, Sakura
        finds out that Shaoran will be returning to Hong Kong…! Having made her
        mind, Sakura starts making a certain item… This is a remake of the last
        episode of the original series and is a prologue to "Card Captor Sakura:
        Clear Card TV" series</image:caption
