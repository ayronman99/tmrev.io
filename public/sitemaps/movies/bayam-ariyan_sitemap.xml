        >The film is about a bad cop Mithran (Kishore), who utilizes the useless
        and violent youngster to indulge in conniving activities only to get his
        pockets overwhelmed with profit. Vinoth (Magesh Kumar) is his right pick
        as he heeds for his orders and he’s one such cruel guy, who beats his
        mother black and blue for money. Saranya enacts his mother’s role and
        she completely possesses the qualities of yesteryear mother in Tamil
        cinema. Meanwhile, he falls in love with Nivedha (Udhayathara) and even
        she falls for him. When things are going finer, his life turns
        topsy-turvy when his mother passes away. He starts feeling a lot missing
        her. Meanwhile Mithran and Vinoth tend to lock horns with each other
        with a shockingly repellent climax.</image:caption
