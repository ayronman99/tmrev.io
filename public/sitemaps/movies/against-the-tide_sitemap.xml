        >Set in the rural Sri Lanka of 1989, civil war is raging but hasn't yet
        touched the life of nine-year-old Sirimal. One day his boatman father is
        asked to ferry a group of armed strangers over to their island, and they
        are shortly followed by the army. Gun battles and arrests soon follow
        and Sirimal's world is turned upside down when his father disappears.
