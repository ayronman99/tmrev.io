        >After being married for seven years, Xu Lang, a white collar office
        manager, has started to get tired of the same routine in his marriage.
        After asking his wife for a divorce, he is given a magical cell phone by
        an angel. The cell phone allows him to have romantic encounters with
        different women. After various dates and courtships with 12 beautiful
        women, he still cannot meet the right one. He attempts to mend things
        over with his wife, only to find that his ex-wife has met another man
        and found happiness. The movie ends with Xu meeting his old love
        interest from 15 years ago, suggesting a new relationship between
        them.</image:caption
