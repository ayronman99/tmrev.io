        >For the past five years, Lin has been looking after the son and the
        elderly mother of his deceased boyfriend. They live together like a
        family, and it is Lin’s way of remembering Li-wei - by continuing to be
        in the life he once had and loving the people he once loved. But when
        Mrs Chou passes away, her other son returns from overseas and discovers
        that Mrs Chou’s property is passed on to Yo-you, who has been legally
        adopted by Lin. Li-gang contacts the police, accusing Lin of killing his
        mother. As the ensuing investigation continues, more and more evidence
        mounts against Lin.</image:caption
