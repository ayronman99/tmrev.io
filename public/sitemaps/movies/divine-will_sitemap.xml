        >Life in Punkyville, Kentucky has always been a bit...unconventional,
        but when Will Blessing unexpectedly arrives, things really get
        interesting. Will comes with his uncle, Dave, a former rock star in the
        90's band Isolation, who has been hired as the church's new choir
        director. Under Dave's talented leadership the choir begins to thrive.
        Meanwhile, the mysterious Will begins to affect the town with a divine
        gift of his own. Faith, love and laughter intertwine as Punkyville
        becomes a town of music and miracles.</image:caption
