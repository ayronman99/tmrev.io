        >Oscar®-winning filmmaker Barbara Kopple explores the legacy of the 1989
        murder of Noreen Boyle in Mansfield, Ohio. Her 12-year-old son Collier
        gave a devastating videotaped testimony blaming his father for the
        murder. Now, over two decades later, Collier returns to Ohio seeking to
        retrace his past and confront his imprisoned father, who remains in
        denial of his guilt. Collier’s depth of character is a wonder to behold
        from childhood to adulthood. Out of this tragic story, we witness the
        power of human resilience.</image:caption
