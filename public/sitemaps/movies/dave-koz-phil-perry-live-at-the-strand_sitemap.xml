        >Saxophonist Dave Koz has become one of the most successful and beloved
        instrumentalists of his time, and helped establish smooth jazz as a
        musical force to be reckoned with. His career catapulted with 1993's
        Lucky Man, one of Koz' slickest and most commercial releases (which is
        not a bad thing by any means) to date. The album has an undeniably crisp
        and clean feel, akin to the color schemes used in the artwork. The
        musical styles range from funky and peppy, as in the opening "Shakin'
        the Shack," "Silverlining," and the evergreen "You Make Me Smile," to
        tender and sweet, as in "Faces of the Heart," "Lucky Man," and "Tender
        Is the Night," which features hypnotic vocals courtesy of Phil Perry.
