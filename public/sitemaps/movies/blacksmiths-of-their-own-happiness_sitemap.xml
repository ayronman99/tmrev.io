        >A two-story house on the former Sverdlovsk outskirts has cracked in
        half. A crack two fists wide passed exactly in the middle. The residents
        of the house are fighting for their happiness in various ways, some are
        dying. For example, an artist has died. He managed to draw a film, his
        son, Ilya, sang a movie, and the film crew only had to shoot the "First
        Movie".</image:caption
