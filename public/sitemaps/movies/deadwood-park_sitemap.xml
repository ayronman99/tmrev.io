        >The small community of Eidolon Crossing once boasted a flourishing
        economy and great prosperity, fueled by Dogwood Park, an amusement park
        at the edge of town. Then the child murders began. When the first
        child's corpse was discovered at Dogwood Park, the town knew they had
        been pulled into a horrible nightmare. As more murdered children were
        unearthed on the amusement park property, attendance began to decline.
        Finally, the macabre publicity shut the park down entirely. Dogwood Park
        was abandoned. The old amusement park became known as "Deadwood Park" by
        the locals. Eidolon Crossing quickly withered into poverty. Over the
        course of 35 years, 26 children disappeared at the hands of the elusive
        murderer. In 1979, Jake Richardson's little brother Francis was the last
        of the children to be abducted. Jake and his parents moved away from
        Eidolon Crossing shortly thereafter...</image:caption
