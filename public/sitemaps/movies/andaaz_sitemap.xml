        >Young Raj Malhotra (Akshay Kumar) lives with his elder brother, Rohit;
        his sister-in-law Kiran, and a niece. After an accident fractures his
        leg, he is unable to walk for some time. Due to psychological reasons,
        he cannot walk even after the fracture heals. When the Malhotras move to
        Dehra Dun, Raj befriends young Kajal (Dutta), as both share a common
        passion for airplanes. Kajal encourages Raj to walk, and succeeds. Years
        later the two continue to be fast friends, and everyone expects them to
        marry soon. Then Raj is recruited by the Indian Air Force and goes for
        training for a year and a half. After his training gets over, he rushes
        to Kajal to propose to her, only to find out that she has given her
        heart to a multimillionaire, Karan Singhania (Verma), who owns several
        airplanes and choppers. Raj congratulates Kajal and Karan, but does not
        reveal his true feelings.</image:caption
