        >Actor, dancer, and choreographer, Chief-Moon is founder of the Coyote
        Arts Percussive Performance Association, and member of the Blackfoot
        Confederacy, member of the Blood Band. Through his art and his life,
        Chief-Moon's story is one of cultural survival. Themes of his dance
        creations begin with his people's traditional stories, his attachment to
        the land and his community, as well as the inner conflict he faces in
        existing within the Aboriginal culture and the wider community. The
        documentary also explores his identity as a First Nations two-spirited
        gay man and a father of three adopted children. His art and his life
        cross boundaries. Challenging the cultural construct is never easy; but
        Chief-Moon does.</image:caption
