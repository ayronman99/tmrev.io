        >Marcela can't bear Jarda any longer, so she threatens divorce and takes
        the kids to her mom's, whose husband is a creep. While Marcela is there,
        Jarda is jailed, because he is part of a gang steeling cars and they get
        caught in the act. Benes, the urbane man whose car got stolen by Jarda
        and his gang, befriends Marcela. Soon she feels drawn to Benes and all
        of a sudden she must make up her mind: Jarda is still sexually
        attractive to her, but Benes offers security, and her own body and mind
        may not pull at the same strand.</image:caption
