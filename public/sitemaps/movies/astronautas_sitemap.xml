        >Daniel is approaching forty. Laura is almost sixteen. From what they
        say about him he must be a poet or a comic-strip illustrator, or both.
        He has just overcome a long addiction and, once back home, is trying to
        recongnize his life based on a strategy which consists basically in
        DOING EXACTLY WHAT A "NORMAL" PERSON DOES. Everything that happens to
        Daniel is, more or less, foreseeable because that's what it's all about:
        he should look after his personal grooming, take care of the small
        things, immerse himself in the real world... and so on until he has
        completed the ten small achievements in his manual, a set of
        COMMANDMENTS devised by an insipid public health system psychiatrist.
        And, in the midst of all this, an unexpected happening: Laura arrives in
        the city searching for her brother Andres, Daniel's neighbor. But the
        brother is not home and she decides to wait for him, while organizing
        around Daniel what could be his "perfect world".</image:caption
