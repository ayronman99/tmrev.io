        >Cassious is a hopelessly romantic college student seeking to find love
        and companionship with his best friend Jenesis. Jenesis is an
        emotionally scarred college girl who has outspokenly lost her faith in
        true love. Cassious is careful to not to spill his true feelings knowing
        her feelings regarding love and their friendship. Jenesis expresses her
        stern opinions of love in one of her college courses and winds up with a
        special assignment. Jenesis is challenged by her professor to document
        the opinions of at least 10 of her peers on the question "What is
        love?". Once she has documented her peers she is then to document her
        opinion after listening to her peers to see if her idea has changed. As
        Jenesis has done her whole life, she depends on Cassious to help her
        complete her learning and love. Cassious gets ribbed by his friends for
        following Jenesis around constantly and being her errand boy as she
        jumps from guy to guy and dismissed Cassious' obvious feelings...
