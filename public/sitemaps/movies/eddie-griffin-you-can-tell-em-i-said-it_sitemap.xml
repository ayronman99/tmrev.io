        >Eddie Griffin proves once more that he’s one of the world’s premiere
        comedic talents in his brand-new stand-up special You Can Tell ‘Em I
        Said It. Eddie unapologetically rips into everything from racial
        stereotypes to Viagra to the First Lady and will leave you gasping for
        air as he buzzes around the stage and literally climbs the walls. This
        uncut, uncensored stand-up special live from Oakland, California will
        keep you laughing long after he exits the stage and coming back to watch
        it again and again.</image:caption
