        >Award-winning director Langjahr returns to his beloved Alps to document
        a group of people continuing the legacy of their forefathers. Every year
        on Swiss National day, August 1, the Wildheuer climb up the steep
        mountain of the «Hinteren Heubrig», fitted out with scythes and wearing
        wooden shoes with spikes, just as their ancestors did before them. They
        are part of a generation who have lived with the challenges of nature
        and survived it. In his film, Langjahr's poetic realism gives an insight
        into these people's experience of the simple life, the very foundation
        of human existence.</image:caption
