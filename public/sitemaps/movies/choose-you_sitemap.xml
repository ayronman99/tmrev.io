        >This is what it looks like when Lena Dunham, Spike Jonze, Avicii,
        Vanessa Hudgens and Michael Shannon get together. Dunham wrote a short
        film for Sunday night's YouTube Music Awards about a heartbroken guy
        (Nick Lashaway) whose ex-girlfriend (Hudgens) is hooking up with a daft
        DJ (Shannon). Things start to look up for the protagonist when he meets
        an impetuous young woman (Dree Hemingway), but the pleasure is only
        fleeting thanks to the film's finale, which was chosen by the viewing
        audience: "a double tragedy" in the vein of "Romeo &amp; Juliet" set to
        the beat of Avicii's "Wake Me Up" and played for laughs.</image:caption
