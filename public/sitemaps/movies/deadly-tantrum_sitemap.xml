        >Geoffrey, the mutant simpleton is indulging in his dual hobbies of DIY
        and homicide, having kidnapped another hapless victim and tied her to
        one of his over-elaborate, death-inducing contraptions. But this time he
        didn't count on being interrupted by a rather over zealous cop who's
        willing to do just about anything, no matter how dangerous (or stupid),
        to save the damsel in distress. Will our hero save the girl before
        Geoffrey's home made death machine goes off or will Geoffrey add another
        victim to his ever growing list - and just how can our hero make
        Geoffrey stay dead? Featuring ridiculous stunts and gruesome special
        effects, Deadly Tantrum is a five minute frenzy of over the top action
        and full on horror comedy</image:caption
