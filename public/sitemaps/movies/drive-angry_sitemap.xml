        >Milton is a hardened felon who has broken out of Hell, intent on
        finding the vicious cult who brutally murdered his daughter and
        kidnapped her baby. He joins forces with a sexy, tough-as-nails
        waitress, who's also seeking redemption of her own. Caught in a deadly
        race against time, Milton has three days to avoid capture, avenge his
        daughter's death, and save her baby before she's mercilessly sacrificed
        by the cult.</image:caption
