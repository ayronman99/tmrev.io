        >An original portrayal of a small Czech village where – as the locals
        put it – an UFO has landed in the form of a kilometre-long silverish
        factory: a Korean Hyundai automobile plant. The village, hitherto famous
        mostly for its sauerkraut and the “Radegast” beer was thus turned into
        an industrial zone – the largest greenfield investment project in the
        Czech Republic’s history. Nonetheless, for a long time many farmers
        resisted selling the land upon which the factory was now standing.
        Eventually, they all succumbed under the pressure from the neighbours,
        and even the anonymous death threats. The filmmakers returned to
        Nošovice two years after the dramatic property buyouts, at the time when
        the factory has just started churning out cheap cars. Combining the
        perspectives of seven characters, they have composed a portrayal of a
        place suddenly changed beyond recognition that is playful and chilling
        at the same time: a politically engaged absurd flick about a field that
        yields cars.</image:caption
