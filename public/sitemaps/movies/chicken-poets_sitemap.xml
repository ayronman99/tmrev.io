        >Yun Fei, a young poet, seeks the advice of an old university friend who
        lives in the Beijing suburbs, discovering that his friend has gone into
        business breeding black chickens. Discouraged about his future as a
        poet, Yun Fei starts a relationship with a colorblind young girl who
        encourages him to persevere. But even this new relationship is not
        enough to inspire him to write. It’s at this point that he buys a
        pirated record whose magical powers bring him the success he’s longed
        for. However, sudden fame does not seem to solve everything. The first
        film of Beijing theatre director Meng Jing Hui, Chicken Poets is an
        insightful and poetic look at materialism and the younger generation in
        China.</image:caption
