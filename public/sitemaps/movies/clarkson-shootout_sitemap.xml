        >2003 has been the best year for new cars ever. But I’m not interested
        in reliability, fuel consumption or even cup holders. This is all about
        finding the car of the year that put the biggest smile on my
        face.....It’s all about excitement... So I put the Bentley Continental
        GT head to head against the Rolls Royce Phantom in a heavy metal drag
        race. I pitch the Mitsubishi Evo VIII against its old enemy the Subaru
        Imprezza Sti. I choose the best road car you can use on a track and the
        contenders are the Lotus Elise, the Vauxhall VX220 Turbo and the new
        TVR350C. There's a supercar showdown between the Pagani Zonda and the
        Koenigsegg. And I throw down the gauntlet to the Lamborghini Gallardo,
        the Aston Martin DB7 GT, the Porsche GT3 and many, many more. I also
        found time to put a new spin on the art of caravan towing - flipping one
        on to its roof and hooking it up to a super fast Overfinch Range Rover.
        In fact, I had so much fun...I’m still smiling now. I'm sure you will
        too.</image:caption
