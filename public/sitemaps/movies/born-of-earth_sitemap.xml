        >Over centuries humans have been mysteriously disappearing with no
        explanations, just hushed whispers in the dark. On the surface Prophet
        Hills seems like a perfect place to live and raise a family, but Danny
        Kessler (Baldwin) has seen better days. This is one man's journey to
        find the culprit of the ultimate sacrifice he's endured. He must face
        his demons and go back to the place that has haunted him. He must
        convince family, friends and townspeople that something is not right in
        Prophet Hills. He must make them believe that something evil is living
        beneath their own backyards.</image:caption
