        >This is a documentary about unsung heroes of World War II. In 1943, a
        24-year-old maths student and a GPO engineer combined to hack into
        Hitler's personal super-code machine - not Enigma but an even tougher
        system, which he called his 'secrets writer'. Their break turned the
        Battle of Kursk, powered the D-day landings and orchestrated the end of
        the conflict in Europe. But it was also to be used during the Cold War -
        which meant both men's achievements were hushed up and never officially
        recognized.</image:caption
