        >Sentenced to ten years in prison for a murder he did not commit, Gaëtan
        Lantier has just been cleared thanks to the confession the real criminal
        made before he died. Back in Bellefontaine, his village, the good man is
        the host of a party organized in his honor. As a gift, the mayor and the
        inhabitants give him a magnificent hunting rifle. At first disconcerted,
        Gaëtan pulls himself together and tells the audience that his years of
        imprisonment give him the right to kill the biggest bastard in the
        village. Most of the inhabitants have something to reproach themselves
        with and fear being taken for the silhouette, the one who witnessed the
        murder but never made himself known, even though his testimony would
        have cleared Gaëtan. Fear invades Bellefontaine and everyone tries to
        coax Gaëtan with attentions and gifts.</image:caption
