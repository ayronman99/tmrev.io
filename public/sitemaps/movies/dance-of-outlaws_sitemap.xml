        >A film about a woman who doesn’t exist. Moroccan Hind was raped and
        consequently denied an official identity – she has no other choice but
        to work as a prostitute and traditional wedding dancer, but despite the
        odds of her situation, refuses to give up her dream of dignity,
        motherhood and love. This is a story of modern day outlaws, children of
        prostitutes, abandoned child brides and those who have had to escape to
        the fringes of patriarchal Moroccan society. Through the eyes of one
        young woman we see a life of constant struggle, but also a life free of
        the society’s norms and boundaries. The woman in the centre of the film,
        Hind, is both vulnerable and courageous as she tries to regain her life,
        her children and her mere right to live as an equal human being in the
        21st century.</image:caption
