        >This is the story of Dame Barbara Windsor, the Cockney kid with a
        dazzling smile and talent to match. Preparing to perform in the theatre
        one cold evening in 1993, the cheeky, chirpy blonde Babs recounts the
        people and events that have shaped her life and career over fifty years
        from 1943 to 1993. She contemplates her lonely childhood and WWII
        evacuation, her decision to go from Barbara Ann Deeks to Barbara Windsor
        - inspired by the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, her complicated
        relationship with her father, her doomed marriage to Ronnie Knight,
        capturing the attention of Joan Littlewood and becoming the blonde
        bombshell in the Carry On films. Babs, ever the consummate professional,
        never lets her fans down whatever her personal anguish and steps on the
        stage to rapturous applause.</image:caption
