        >André's Eyes is an experimental docudrama in which the actual family
        members themselves participate in the recreation of their own story. Set
        in a small village in the Portuguese countryside, the film follows the
        struggle of a divorced father to keep his family together after his
        youngest son is taken away from them and placed in a foster
        family.</image:caption
