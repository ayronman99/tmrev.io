        >The doctor and soccer player in the leisure time Jo Hauser decides to
        move to Berlin and be an intern in a famous clinic, expecting to
        increase his knowledge and expertize, and help his handicap brother
        Willi Hauser. He joins a secret fraternity of doctors, under the
        leadership of Prof. Muller-LaRousse, who is researching the use of
        bionic muscles in human beings without any ethics or respect to the
        laws. The team is also volunteer to the experiences, and is under
        investigation of Paula Henning. When Jo gets close to a Filipino nurse,
        and becomes addicted in the drugs used in experience, he realizes the
        truth hidden in the methods used by the secret society in the
        development of science.</image:caption
