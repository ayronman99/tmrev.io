        >Shot over the course of two years, Closer Than That finds the members
        of Duluth "slo-core" band Low (Alan Sparhawk, Mimi Parker, and Zak
        Sally) going through old photos, enduring awkward press interviews,
        serenading the baby, navigating traffic jams, and occasionally coming
        across observations on music, spirituality, and life. Director Marc
        Gartman traveled with them on tour across the US and Europe, capturing
        not only Low's performances, but also quiet moments backstage and in
        transit between gigs. Before one of their European shows, Alan is asked
        how the band would like to be introduced. He answers,
        "slow...quiet...really nice people with a baby." This video document
        gives us a glimpse of the very real, understated folks behind the great
        minimal rock band.</image:caption
