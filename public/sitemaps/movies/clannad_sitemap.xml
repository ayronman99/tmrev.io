        >Clannad is set in a high-school located in some Japanese town. Okazaki
        Tomoya is a third-year student who doesn't take his studies seriously.
        Always late for class, he's seen as a delinquent by the rest of his
        classmates who are busy preparing for their entrance examinations.
        Needless to say, he hasn't too many close friends either.</image:caption
