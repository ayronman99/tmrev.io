        >Manit (Jon Foo) witnessed the murder of his parents when he was just 10
        years old. The killers shot him in the head, but he miraculously
        survived. However, the damage to his brain left him unable to experience
        regular human emotions. A martial arts master saved him and took him in.
        Twenty years later, Manit has become a master of martial arts himself.
        He returns to the scene of the crime, seeking justice.</image:caption
