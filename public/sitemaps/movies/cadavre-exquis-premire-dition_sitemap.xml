        >Roxy, a glam-rock star past his prime who has just made a pact with the
        Devil, goes through much emotional gear shifting when a dozen different
        writers and directors take control of his destiny and rewrite his life
        story as they see fit. In his predestined life, Roxy meets a vide
        variety of colourful characters: women he once loved but has trouble
        recognizing today; a crooked dealer who keeps leading him astray; a drag
        queen on the rebound; a failed playwright; a woman barkeep who's
        interested in Roxy; and, of course, Mephistopheles in all his
        disguises.</image:caption
