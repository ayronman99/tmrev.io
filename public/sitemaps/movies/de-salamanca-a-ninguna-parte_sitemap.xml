        >Human portrait of a generation of filmmakers, born as a result of the
        Salamanca Conversations (1955), who tried to show throughout the 60s the
        social reality of our country. Beyond the review of some times, or a
        description of the facts, we have tried to approach the looks, the
        memories, the silences, the desires and the struggle of its
        protagonists. Because in those years Patino, Borau, Camus, Picazo,
        Summers and Saura set out to do something that no one had asked them to
        do: a different, critical, innovative and personal cinema, values that
        we miss today. Translated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free
