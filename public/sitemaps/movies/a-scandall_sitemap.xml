        >Kuhu, a 9 year old girl, drowns in a lake in Nainital. Soon after, her
        father, Manav falls off a cliff but lives on to lead a strange life of
        hallucinations and complete metamorphosis. Manav now sees his dead
        daughter. When Vidhu, a film school pass out, hears this story from his
        girlfriend Koya, he finds it interesting enough to turn it into a film.
        A small crew of four set out for Nainital, hoping to film paranormal
        activities going around Kuhu's family. Very little they know that their
        exploits will lead them into a quagmire of incest, sex and an unsolved
        murder mystery.</image:caption
