        >Leo and Nina lived happily out of wedlock until one day Nina asked Leo
        to marry him. Leo, hostile to conformity, had always been opposed to the
        idea and it looked as though Nina as well. But giving in to his
        companion's insistence, the young man agrees to an unconventional
        wedding, without the expensive white gown, without the traditional candy
        box, with gifts to charities instead of wedding presents, the lot. Nina
        agrees â€¦ or seems to.</image:caption
