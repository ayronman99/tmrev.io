        >Cefalonia tells the real story about what happened in September 1943 on
        the Greek island of Kefalonia (Cefalonia in Italian), when the 12,000
        men in the Italian 33rd Acqui Infantry Division, following Italy's
        surrender to the Allied, refused to put themselves under German command
        and also refused to surrender their weapons. The local German force,
        supported by Stuka dive-bombers and additional troops, attacked the
        Italians and after several days of combat the Italians surrendered,
        having lost 1,300 men. As punishment, the German High Command ordered
        that all surviving Italians should be executed. Some 5,000 were executed
        during a week of killings. A handful were rescued by locals and the
        Greek guerrilla, while the rest were shipped off as prisoners, whereof
        3,000 drowned when their ships hit mines. The film "Captain Corelli's
        Mandolin" is based on a novel about the Italian occupation of Cefalonia,
        but the massacre was much toned down in the Hollywood
        version.</image:caption
