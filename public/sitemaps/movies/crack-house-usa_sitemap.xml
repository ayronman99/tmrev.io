        >Summer 2005: federal agents and police record over a thousand hours of
        surveillance footage inside a crack house in Rockford Illinois. For six
        weeks the gang smoke weed, play with guns and sell crack and heroin,
        unaware that their every move is being filmed. The customers come and go
        with no clue that their secret lives would be exposed. This is an
        intimate portrait of the rise and fall of a crack house and of an
        American urban community brought down by drugs. Interviews with gang
        members, their families and cops reveal the inescapable tragedy - and
        occasional dark comedy - of a world that lies hidden within every modern
        city.</image:caption
