        >Burned-out Hollywood screenwriter Bo Aikens (Jay Mohr) is fed up with
        life in Los Angeles. He heads out of the hustle and bustle of the big
        city and arrives in picturesque Black River in Northern California,
        seeking relaxation and artistic inspiration. In small, idyllic Black
        River, nearly everyone is happy, contented, and welcoming of strangers.
        But despite the beautiful setting, Bo begins to feel unsettled after
        several disturbing incidents. He discovers that all of his money has
        been transferred to a bank account in Black River, and a house has been
        purchased for him by someone on "his" instructions.</image:caption
