        >After thirty years of marriage, Sandra finds out that her husband is
        having an affair with his best friend. She immediately leaves him and
        has no choice but to seek refuge in her childhood home, where her sister
        Danie still lives. The sisters couldn’t be more different. Danie, a
        stubborn single with a dog and the heart of a social justice warrior vs.
        Sandra, a bourgeois housewife with decades of a secure lifestyle on a
        posh vineyard behind her. Their cohabitation starts out rocky to say the
        least… But with the help of close buddies Roberto and Lucien, Danie
        coaxes Sandra into joining their local dance troupe, and reconnect with
        the greatest joy and talent of her youth. Through their shared passion
        for dance and the solidarity of the troupe’s other dancers, the sisters
        embark on a fresh life path. Because, really, it’s never too late...
        even to fall in love again.</image:caption
