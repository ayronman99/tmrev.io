        >High school dropout and aspiring musician, Mike, spends his days
        hanging out with his friends and confronting the members of the church
        next door. Most members have learned to keep their distance, but Sister
        Thomas is determined to open Mike's mind to GOD and religion. Connecting
        through a love for music she convinces Mike to pick up the Bible and
        start reading. He quickly learns that the Bible truly is a book of songs
        and slowly starts to believe in himself again. With the help of Sister
        Thomas, Mike stands up to his friends and begins to choose a more
        righteous path.</image:caption
