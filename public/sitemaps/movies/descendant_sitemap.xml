        >History exists beyond what is written. The Africatown residents in
        Mobile, Alabama, have shared stories about their origins for
        generations. Their community was founded by enslaved ancestors who were
        transported in 1860 aboard the last known and illegal slave ship,
        Clotilda. Though the ship was intentionally destroyed upon arrival, its
        memory and legacy weren’t. Now, the long-awaited discovery of the
        Clotilda’s remains offers this community a tangible link to their
        ancestors and validation of a history so many tried to
        bury.</image:caption
