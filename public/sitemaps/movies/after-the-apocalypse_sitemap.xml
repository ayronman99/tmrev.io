        >During the Soviet era, the people of Semipalatinsk in Kazakhstan were
        used as human guinea pigs in the testing of nuclear weapons. Today they
        live with the consequences: sheep graze in radioactive giant bomb
        craters and in the most affected villages 1 in 20 children are born with
        birth defects. Dr Toleukhan Nurmagambetov, the boss of the city's
        maternity clinic, wants a genetic passport which will prevent those with
        suspect genes from giving birth. Bibigul - a local woman from the
        test-site - is pregnant and her "defected and frightful" face arouses
        the suspicion of local medical staff. Nurmagambetov labels her a genetic
        failure. He implores Bibigul to get tested and abort the child who he
        fears will be born disabled. Will Bibigul give in? If not, will her
        child be disabled?</image:caption
