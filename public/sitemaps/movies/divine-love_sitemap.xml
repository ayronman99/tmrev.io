        >In 2027 Brazil, civil servant Joana mainly deals with divorce cases. As
        a member of a branch of evangelical Christians known as the Divino Amor
        group, she uses her position to offer a kind of physical therapy to
        couples who want to separate. Although Joana and her husband Danilo
        regularly consummate their marriage, neither her constant prayers nor
        any other methods of assistance seem to be able to fulfill their desire
        for a child.</image:caption
