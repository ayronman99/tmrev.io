        >The movie is about a group of ‘floaters’ in Beijing ?people who live
        and work in Beijing but are not native residents. It is rare for a
        Beijing floater to have a fixed home, as they move from place to place
        according to their job requirements. Many Beijing floaters do not feel a
        sense of belonging. The movie tells the story of Yu Xiaobao, a floater
        who is trying to hide the reality of his struggling life from his
        daughter who still lives in their hometown. As a result, he tells her
        that he has become a film director. When his daughter suddenly decides
        to visit him, he enlists the help of his other floater friends to put on
        a show so that she does not find out the truth.</image:caption
