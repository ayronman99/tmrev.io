        >Alexandra is a lively college student returning to live with her
        roommates Jessica and Breanne after the summer holidays. After a night
        of drinking, Alex agrees to a psychic reading to learn about her future
        with her boyfriend, Brian, but during the reading a dramatic turn of
        events causes SOMETHING to go drastically wrong. When Alex awakes the
        next day, she cant remember the events of the night before. She begins
        to hear creepy noises, hallucinate, black out and receive unidentifiable
        scratch marks all over her body. Afraid shes going crazy, she seeks help
        from her friends but Jessica, Breanne and Brian are incapable of
        comprehending the scope of the darkness descending UPON her. Instead,
        Alex receives help from a school professor and his father who have dealt
        with the supernatural before. But as Alexs condition worsens, it becomes
        apparent that it may already be too late to stop the entity from using
        Alexs body as a gateway into our world (IMDb.com).</image:caption
