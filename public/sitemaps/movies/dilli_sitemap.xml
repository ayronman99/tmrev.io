        >DILLI is a moving collection of heartfelt interviews with Delhi slum
        dwellers. Its lens focuses on a group of dwellers, bringing to life the
        untold story of mass exodus of thousands who were bulldozed from their
        homes and transferred to a makeshift facade - Bawana without water,
        shelter or drainage, while the city was being beautified for
        Commonwealth Games 2010. DILLI - city of dreams - is a universal story
        of millions of underprivileged around the world. DILLI holds up a mirror
        not only to India, but to every nation around the world, whose poor live
        forgotten under bridges, children go hungry, and fathers work thousands
        of miles from their families to provide. DILLI brings awareness. And
        awareness is the first step towards action.</image:caption
