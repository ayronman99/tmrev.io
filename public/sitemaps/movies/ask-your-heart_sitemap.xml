        >A love affair threatened by a barrier as great as itself... Can
        differences of faith stand in the way of an innocent love affair? Two
        young people, Esma and Mustafa, fall in love. For them, the future only
        has meaning if they are together. Failing this, life is meaningless.
        However, overhanging their love is a barrier unique to the period and
        location: Mustafa is a clandestine Christian, when everyone including
        Esma thinks he is Muslim. In the meantime, the Ottoman Empire introduces
        a series of reforms giving Christians the same rights as Muslims. From
        this point on, the Church urges secret Christians to reveal their faith.
        This poses a dilemma for Mustafa: he is caught between his love and the
        Church.</image:caption
