        >As the first documentary filmmaker, Reiner Holzemer has produced a film
        about the most famous German photographer, which shows both, the work
        and his biography. It introduces Sanders heritage from a poor minors
        family in the „Westerwald“, a region located in the midwest of Germany,
        as well as his early career as a studio photographer in Trier and Linz,
        and his most productive period between the Twenties and Thirties in
        Cologne, where he developed his big project „People of the 20th
        century“.</image:caption
