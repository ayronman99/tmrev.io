        >A weekend camping trip turns into a frantic fight against the
        supernatural when an ancient demon and a fearsome female warrior bring
        their eternal battle into the present day. Jason Parks is trying to win
        back his ex-fiancee, Jasmine, by arranging a camping trip with the lost
        love in question, his best friend, Ricky, and their witchcraft-obsessed
        friend, Renee. Little does Jack realize that Jasmine has switched
        teams--these days she's more interested in seducing Renee than marrying
        the man she once loved. But lately Renee's been having horrible dreams
        about Summer Vale, a little girl who vanished without a trace 20 years
        ago. When Renee attempts to contact Summer's spirit, she inadvertently
        opens an interdimensional portal and unleashes a vicious demon.
        Fortunately for the frightened campers, a grown-up, sword-wielding
        Summer manages to get through the portal as well, and sets out to slay
        the malevolent hell-spawn.</image:caption
