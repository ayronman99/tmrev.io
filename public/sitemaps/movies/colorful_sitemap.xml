        >Upon reaching the train station to death, a dejected soul is informed
        that he is lucky and will have another chance at life. He is placed in
        the body of a 14-year-old boy named Kobayashi Makoto, who has just
        committed suicide. Watched over by a neutral spirit named Purapura, the
        soul must figure out what his greatest sin and mistake in his former
        life was, before his time limit in Makoto's body runs out. He also has a
        number of other lesser duties he must complete, such as understanding
        what led Makoto to commit suicide in the first place and learning how to
        enjoy his second chance at life.</image:caption
