        >Marine biologist Skylar Shane hires an expat charter boat captain, Jack
        Bowman, to help her find prehistoric life form samples in the north
        Sumatran Sea. During the expedition, they run into some of Jack's
        'friends', a gang of smugglers headquartered on a fishing platform in
        the middle of the sea. Tamal, an orphan sold into servitude on the
        fishing platform by his uncle, a 'Dukun' (sorcerer and master of black
        magic) shaman, begs Skylar to take him away. She empathizes with the
        boy, who reminds her of her lost daughter, Rebecca, and is determined to
        help him, not knowing what lurks beneath the dark inky water, waiting to
        surface. Ever since Tamal arrived, mysterious things begin to happen,
        until one by one the smugglers will be killed by the terrifying creature
        from the deep. In the middle of an eerie, violent storm, the animus
        inside Tamal grows stronger, calling for the ancient creature of his
        nightmares...</image:caption
