        >Panzazo! It reflects the reality of education in Mexico and
        demonstrates that Mexican society panzazo passes in an exclusionary
        system in which no lessons for life are achieved. We see in this movie
        moms, dads, principals, teachers, officials, union representatives and
        opinion leaders to draw a global picture that does not allow
        indifference. The data, interviews and what the students filmed with
        handheld cameras give rise to indignation and intelligent to realize the
        part that touches everyone contribute. The project ran for three years
        entering the reality of the students and their families, capturing the
        daily dynamics of schools in such diverse parts of the country such as
        Ciudad Juarez, the interior of Yucatan, Morelia, the mountains of
        Chiapas and Guerrero, as well as Naucalpan and Iztapalapa in the
        metropolitan area of ​​Mexico City. EDIT: To clarify, "de panzazo" means
        "just squeaking through."</image:caption
