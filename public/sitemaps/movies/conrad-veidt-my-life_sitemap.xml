        >German actor Conrad Veidt is best remembered for playing Nazi Major
        Strasser in Casablanca. In reality, he was an ardent anti-fascist who
        left Nazi Germany for Britain, falsely claiming to be Jewish in
        solidarity with his Jewish wife. Using clips from Veidt’s films,
        acclaimed director Mark Rappaport imagines the actor narrating his life
        and career from the silent era—including his leading roles in The
        Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and The Man Who Laughs through to his Hollywood
        years where he often played a Nazi.</image:caption
