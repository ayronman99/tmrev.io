        >In this fun, filled romp, Mecha and Ophelia, a couple, are going
        through a crisis caused by a third woman. Mecha decides to get over it
        and swears to Ophelia that she'll stop seeing her lover. After a few
        months, she realizes she can't do it. Ophelia can't leave Mecha either,
        and decides to find a lover herself. Events take the most unexpected of
        turns for Mecha, who realizes her angst persists, and starts to suspect
        it has nothing to do with love...or does it?</image:caption
