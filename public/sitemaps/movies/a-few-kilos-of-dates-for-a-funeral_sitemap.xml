        >The film is set around three protagonists. Two run a gas station on the
        outskirts of town, on a road that gets next to no traffic anymore, and
        so they get next to no customers. They live and work out of a decrepit
        van on site, its windows covered in plastic. Sadry is a former
        strongman, now blind in one eye. He is the boss of the station. Yadi is
        his eager to please assistant, who usually annoys more than pleases.
        Finally there is the postman, Abbas, who longs to trade in his brakeless
        bicycle for a motorcycle, while he must care for his mentally ill
        brother.</image:caption
