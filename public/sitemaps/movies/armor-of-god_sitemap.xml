        >Ear-splitting improvisational noise sculpture and Christianity aren't
        normally mentioned in the same breath. But they are the twin passions of
        North Carolina musician Scotty Irving, and the essential elements of his
        one-man act, Clang Quartet. Using homemade instruments achieving
        unfathomable volumes (and inspired by Biblical verse), Irving challenges
        his audience to rethink traditional ideas of music and spirituality.
        When Irving's motivations for walking so far out on musical and
        theological limbs are revealed, the "Armor of God" becomes a metaphor
        for the courage to create. Armor of God screened at more than eighty
        festivals and cinema venues internationally, winning nine awards
        (including a Juror's Citation from the Black Maria Film and Video
        Festival). The film also screened on regional PBS. --
