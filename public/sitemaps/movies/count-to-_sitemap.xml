        >A teenage boy and his mother are on the run. The father is violent and
        has a history of beating up his wife. They manage to get away from him
        and drive far away, until they arrive in a small town where they settle
        down. They rent a house from a nice man and soon they forget everything
        that has happened in the past, until the boy begins to have bad dreams
        of his father.</image:caption
