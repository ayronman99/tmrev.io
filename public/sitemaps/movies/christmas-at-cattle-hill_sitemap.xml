        >Klara the Calf is excited to spend her first Christmas on Cattle Hill
        with her Father, but when they arrive at the farm Klara is disappointed
        to see he has not attempted to decorate for the holidays. When her
        father is unexpectedly called away for work, Klara sees it as an
        opportunity to make Cattle Hill a Christmas paradise with the help of
        the cheeky christmas elf who lives on the farm, but as Klara finds out
