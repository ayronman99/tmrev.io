        >Olive, an average high school student, sees her below-the-radar
        existence turn around overnight once she decides to use the school's
        gossip grapevine to advance her social standing. Now her classmates are
        turning against her and the school board is becoming concerned,
        including her favorite teacher and the distracted guidance counselor.
        With the support of her hilariously idiosyncratic parents and a little
        help from a long-time crush, Olive attempts to take on her notorious new
        identity and crush the rumor mill once and for all.</image:caption
