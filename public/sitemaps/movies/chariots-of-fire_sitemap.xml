        >In the class-obsessed and religiously divided UK of the early 1920s,
        two determined young runners train for the 1924 Paris Olympics. Eric
        Liddell, a devout Christian born to Scottish missionaries in China, sees
        running as part of his worship of God's glory and refuses to train or
        compete on the Sabbath. Harold Abrahams overcomes anti-Semitism and
        class bias, but neglects his beloved sweetheart in his single-minded
        quest.</image:caption
