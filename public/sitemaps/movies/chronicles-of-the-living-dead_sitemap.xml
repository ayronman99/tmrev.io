        >The inside story of the important horror classic "Night of the Living
        Dead" as told by those who were there and those who were inspired by it.
        Including rare archival interviews, new interviews and visits to the
        original locations, "Chronicles of the Living Dead" also addresses the
        issue of the film's infamous copyright status, a legal debacle that
        continues to plague the original creators to this day. Named one of the
        100 Most Important American Films by both the AFI and the BBC, "Night"
        is brought alive once again through the fond rememberances of the cast
        and crew.</image:caption
