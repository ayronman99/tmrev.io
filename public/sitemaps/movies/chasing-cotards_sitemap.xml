        >Once a successful artist, Hart is now a shadow of his former self, his
        world torn apart by loss. He is consumed by a haunting portrait of his
        deceased wife and spends every moment studying her face, unable to
        forget. Knowing that she was taken away from him too soon, all he wishes
        is that she would return to breathe life into his world once
        more.</image:caption
