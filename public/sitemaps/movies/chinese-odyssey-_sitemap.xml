        >The Emperor is desperate for the free-spirited life of a wanderer, and
        tries to escape from the royal palace with his sister, the Princess.
        He's caught and returned to his angry mother by the royal guards, but
        the Princess, disguised as a man, manages to escape. Meanwhile, King
        Bully has returned to his hometown, where he is widely despised for his
        bullying ways, to run a restaurant with his tomboy sister, Phoenix. They
        have a very close relationship. In fact, King Bully mistakenly believes
        that he can read his sister's mind. When the Princess arrives in town,
        King Bully finds himself drawn to her, but, believing she's a man,
        decides that his attraction is some kind of empathy with
        Phoenix.</image:caption
