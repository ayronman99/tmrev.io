        >Leung plays Jennifer, the spoiled-rotten daughter of a millionaire.
        When Jennifer's father realizes that she's spending way too much money,
        he hires Kit (Lau) to pretend to be a Filipino chauffeur and chaperone
        her. Then, Jennifer's father decides that he's going to teach her the
        value of money and hard-work, so he pretends to be ill, leaving all the
        money to Pamela, his business partner. Pamela kicks Jennifer out into
        the street to live with Kit/Mario. The two learn to live together and
        work hard to get back on top.</image:caption
