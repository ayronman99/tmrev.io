        >On June 4, 1944 Captain Daniel Gallery and his men of the U.S. Naval
        Task Force 22.3 did the nearly impossible - they captured a German
        U-boat. It was the first enemy vessel-of-war captured in battle on the
        high seas by the U.S. Navy since 1815. Climb aboard the historic U-505
        and relive its journey from a powerhouse of the German fleet to a
        display at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago. Witness
        archival footage and rare interviews with both German and American crew
        members involved in the capture of the U-505. And view even rarer
        footage of Captains Daniel Gallery and Harold Lange, captain of the 505
        at the time of its capture..</image:caption
