        >Just as he's about to graduate, senior classman David Easter gets the
        shock of his young life when a new teacher invents 13th grade in this
        comedy. Their longed-for freedom threatened, David and his friends set
        out to make sure they graduate in the expected four years. Meanwhile, a

        develops a strange relationship with the school's 21-year-old
        principal.</image:caption
