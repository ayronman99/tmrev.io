        >In November of 1970 James Taylor and Carole King first performed
        together at the Troubadour on Santa Monica Boulevard in West Hollywood,
        California. Taylor had just released his debut album for the Beatles'
        newly formed Apple Records and King was finding her way as a first time
        solo performer even though by then she was a famous songwriter with a
        string of hits for other artists. When they returned to the club for a
        two-week co-headlining run in 1971 their lives were somewhat different.
        That summer Taylor's "Fire and Rain" was topping the charts and King's
        landmark Tapestry was on its way to making her a music superstar.
        Thirty-six years later, in November 2007, James Taylor, Carole King and
        members of their renowned original band "The Section" (featuring
        guitarist Danny Kortchmar, bassist Leland Sklar and drummer Russell
        Kunkel) returned to the Troubadour for a three-night, six-show run to
        celebrate the venue's 50th anniversary.</image:caption
