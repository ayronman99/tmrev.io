        >Doc Pomus’ dramatic life is one of American music’s great untold
        stories. Paralyzed with polio as a child, Brooklyn-born Jerome Felder
        reinvented himself as a blues singer, renaming himself Doc Pomus, then
        emerged as one of the most brilliant songwriters of the early rock and
        roll era, writing “Save the Last Dance for Me,” “This Magic Moment,” “A
        Teenager in Love,” “Viva Las Vegas,” and dozens of other hits.
        Spearheaded and co-produced by his daughter, Sharyn Felder, and packed
        with incomparable music and rare archival imagery, this documentary
        features interviews with collaborators and friends including Dr. John,
        Ben E. King, Joan Osborne, Shawn Colvin, Dion, Leiber and Stoller, and
        B.B. King, as well as passages from Doc’s private journals read by his
        close friend Lou Reed.</image:caption
