        >Babar is a young elephant in the great forest. Whilst out with his
        mother a hunter kills his mother and he flees to escape the same fate.
        He eventually finds himself in a human city and experiences the many
        differences between city and forest life. Treated as an outsider he is
        taken in by an elderly woman, dressed in fancy suits, taught to write
        and count and is brought up in human culture.</image:caption
