        >A Flea Market Documentary is a new PBS special and an all-American
        celebration of open-air shopping across the country. On any weekend,
        there may be no better place to find out what makes America great than
        at a flea market. A Flea Market Documentary is an unabashed celebration
        of the unusual people and the enticing things that can be found in
        parking lots, fairgrounds, drive-ins, sidewalks, and wherever else
        someone has posted a sign saying "Flea Market." It's capitalism mixed
        with craziness. It's amazing old stuff, great salespeople, the ancient
        tradition of the open-air market, and the possibility of finding a
        bargain, all uniting shoppers across the nation. Produced by WQED
        Pittsburgh, A Flea Market Documentary travels from the gigantic Rose
        Bowl Market in Pasadena, California, to the busy but modest- sized
        Eastern Market in Washington, DC, talking with organizers, vendors, food
        merchants and shoppers.</image:caption
