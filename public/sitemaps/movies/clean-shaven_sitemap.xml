        >Peter Winter is a young schizophrenic who is desperately trying to get
        his daughter back from her adoptive family. He attempts to function in a
        world that, for him, is filled with strange voices, electrical noise,
        disconcerting images, and jarringly sudden emotional shifts. During his
        quest, he runs afoul of the law and an ongoing murder
        investigation.</image:caption
