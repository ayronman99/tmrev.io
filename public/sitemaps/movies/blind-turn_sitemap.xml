        >Samantha Holt had the perfect life with a handsome fiancée and a future
        that couldn’t look brighter. But an unexpected turn on a dark lonely
        road puts her on a collision course with Bruce Miller, a devoted family
        man who descends into madness when he loses everything he ever cared
        about. One year later, Bruce decides to give Samantha the punishment he
        believes she escaped. Samantha has struggled with her own demons since
        that fateful night, and Bruce will take her struggles to the edge when
        he implements a demented plan to teach her a twisted lesson that may
        cost her the ultimate price.</image:caption
