        >Akira Yamazaki and Akira Kaido are new employees at Industrial Central
        Bank. They are both outstanding at their jobs and fierce rivals, but
        they come from totally different backgrounds. When Akira Yamazaki was a
        child, his father's factory went bankrupt and his family ran away in the
        middle of the night. Because of that experience, Akira Yamazaki wants to
        work as a banker to save people. On the other hand, Akira Kaido was born
        into a family that runs a large company. He works with a calm demeanor.
        Due to a case, Akira Yamazaki receives a demotion. Akira Kaido continues
        to be successful at work, but his family's company is on the verge of
        bankruptcy due to their family-oriented management style. The employees
        there and their families are all in a crisis situation. With this
        desperate situation unfolding, the reversal of fate of these two men
        begin.</image:caption
