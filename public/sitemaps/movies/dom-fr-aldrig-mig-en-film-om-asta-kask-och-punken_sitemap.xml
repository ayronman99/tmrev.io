        >In this one-hour documentary, we get to follow one of Sweden's most
        influential punk bands. During their active period 1978-86 they played
        in every single hole and sold lots of records, yet it was silent about
        them in the media. Although it's been twenty years since they stopped
        playing, they have always been discovered by new fans. In 2003, Asta
        Kask picks up the instruments again - not to be reunited but to take
        revenge on everyone who has been deceiving them over the years. The
        Gothenburg films Erik Kolthoff and Staffan Danielsson have followed the
        band during their revenge tour. Interviews about Asta Kask and the punk
        movement are mixed with old and new live material.</image:caption
