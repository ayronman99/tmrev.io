        >Adventurer-geologist Dr. Martin Pepper sets out to prove his theory –
        that the true Atlantis existed on the Greek island of Santorini, and was
        destroyed in the biggest volcanic eruption in human history. In order to
        achieve his goal, Pepper will use new scientific evidence gathered using
        state-of-the-art sonar scans of the sea bed and microscopic analysis of
        the ancient landscape. He must also match Santorini to a series of key
        clues embedded in the first ever description of Atlantis by the Greek
        philosopher Plato – from the lost city’s strange ring-shaped design, to
        the role Egyptian priests played in recording the legend in the first
        place. By the end of the program, he reveals the stunning findings which
        may pinpoint the city and show exactly what it looked
        like.</image:caption
