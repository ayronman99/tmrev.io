        >Ambitious high school senior Samantha Hodges is a serious journalist,
        both for the school paper and for the yearbook, but she's just as
        serious about her friends, Nate, Gillian, and Rudy, all of whom are
        vying with her for a full-ride local scholarship to college. Very close
        to her mother, Emily, who is the school's guidance counselor, Samantha
        finds her reporting taking an investigative turn when two of her
        classmates--and contenders for the scholarship--are
        murdered.</image:caption
