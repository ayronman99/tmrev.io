        >In January 1996 filming began on a new episode of Doctor Who set in San
        Francisco, but shot in Vancouver, Canada. Sylvester McCoy flew out to
        join the production team to re-create his role as the Seventh Doctor and
        to hand over to Paul McGann. In this behind-the-scenes video diary,
        Sylvester gives us a personal account of his final days as the famous
        Timelord. Reminiscing about the "old days" and drawing comparisons with
        the experience of working on this latest adventure, he talks to Paul
        McGann, Daphne Ashbrook (Dr Grace Holloway) from the new production and
        Anneke Wills (Polly) from the show's past. All shot on Hi-8
        camcorder.</image:caption
