        >While its fearsome ancestor, the wolf, was created by natural
        selection-it is man that created the dog. This film explores the
        greatest inter-species friendship on Earth over the course of 40,000
        years. Working closely with scientists, we deconstruct the genetic
        history of your favorite companion and explore how man has consistently
        re-engineered the dog to adapt to a changing world. An amazing story of
        how we have taken qualities we cherish from the wolf-loyalty, territory,
        protection and family-and bred them into a sweet, compliant animal that
        we call the dog.</image:caption
