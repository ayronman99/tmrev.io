        >Arkusan is 23 years old, unemployed and still living with his mother.
        Nothing by choice. Not even hanging out with his "best friend" Ronkas is
        by choice. Being unemployed means being broke, so the only way to get by
        for Arkusan is to drift around his small hometown Brunkaby in Sweden and
        indulge in conversations about dreams, depression and masturbation with
        his fellow under financed com padres. During one boring, Gray day
        Arkusan summarizes his thoughts, views and opinions about his friends,
        his future prospects and living today's Sweden.</image:caption
