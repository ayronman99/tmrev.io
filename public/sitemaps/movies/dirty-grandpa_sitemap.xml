        >Jason Kelly is one week away from marrying his boss's uber-controlling
        daughter, putting him on the fast track for a partnership at the law
        firm. However, when the straight-laced Jason is tricked into driving his
        foul-mouthed grandfather, Dick, to Daytona for spring break, his pending
        nuptials are suddenly in jeopardy. Between riotous frat parties, bar
        fights, and an epic night of karaoke, Dick is on a quest to live his
        life to the fullest and bring Jason along for the ride.</image:caption
