        >A mysterious creature destroys 70% of the moon. The creature then warns
        that if he is not destroyed by March of next year, Earth will be next.
        The creature also demands that he becomes the homeroom teacher for 3rd
        grade E class at Kunugigaoka Junior High School. The government is
        powerless to say no. The creature then becomes the homeroom teacher of
        3rd grade E class which consists of failed students including Nagisa
        Shiota (Ryosuke Yamada). The creature is called Teacher Koro. Meanwhile,
        the government requests that the students try to kill Teacher Koro even
        though he possesses super powers. The government offers a 10 billion yen
        reward for whomever successfully kills him. The students are confused by
        the situation, but decide to kill Teacher Koro. When their class begins
        with Teacher Koro, the students finds themselves having a good time with
        their new teacher.</image:caption
