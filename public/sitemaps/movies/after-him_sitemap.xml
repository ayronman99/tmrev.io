        >When Camille's son was killed in a car accident, the devastating loss
        proved too much for emotionally fragile mother to bear. Now desperately
        clinging to any reminder of the son she held so close to her heart,
        Camille becomes increasingly fixated on Frank - the young man who was
        not only her child's best friend, but the one who was responsible for
        the tragic accident that took his life as well. At first, Frank is
        receptive to Camille's advances. It's not long, however, before the
        pair's scandalous relationship prompts many of Camille's friends to
        distance themselves from the increasingly unstable woman. Later, as
        Camille's obsession with Frank turns menacing, the relationship between
        grief-stricken mother and her guilt-ridden lover begins to take on
        ominous undertones.</image:caption
