        >In the works for over two years, A Second Knock at the Door offers a
        rare glimpse into the lives of military families dealing with the loss
        of loved ones to friendly fire. Through interviews and investigative
        reports obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, this
        documentary explores several key incidents in which the families of the
        fallen were forced to embark on a quest for the truth after the Army
        attempted to bury the true cause of death within the 'fog of
        war.'</image:caption
