        >The path to Yusef Lateef was a journey into the unknown. We were aware
        that he is one of the great maestros of jazz and one of the last of his
        generation still alive. In an era of black culture that probably found
        its strongest form of expression in music, he was a contemporary and
        companion of those musicians who helped to shape and renew jazz: John
        Coltrane, Dizzy Gillespie, Charles Mingus, Cannonball Adderley. Now, at
        the age of 84, Yusef Lateef lives withdrawn in his house in the woods
        somewhere in New England â€“ in a room full of musical instruments. He
        still plays his saxophone today, as he has done for most of his life.
