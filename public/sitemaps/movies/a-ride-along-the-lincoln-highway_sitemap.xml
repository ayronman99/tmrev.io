        >The Lincoln Highway was established in 1913 as Americaâ€™s first
        coast-to-coast paved highway. It connected New York City with San
        Francisco and passed through towns and cities in 13 states. It was an
        adventure for early motorists, and drivers today still love its hidden
        charms and all the stuff along its several paths. A RIDE ALONG THE
        LINCOLN HIGHWAY considers some of the history of the road and shows some
        of the joys of finding and riding along the various alignments of the
        highway today. Along the way, we meet highway historians and enthusiasts
        from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to Evanston, Wyoming, and many places in
        between. We check out the cottages at the Lincoln Motor Court near
        Bedford, PA, stop for lunch in Mount Vernon, Iowa, meet some folks in
        Eureka, Nevada, and even walk out to the end of the Berkeley pier in
        California. It's a great trip.</image:caption
