        >Russia is being terrorized by an evil witch known as Baba Yaga; the
        only one who is not afraid of her is Bartok the Magnificent. Bartok, an
        albino bat, has just arrived in Moscow and is impressing everyone with
        his performances, including Prince Ivan Romanov. However, one person is
        not impressed; Ludmilla finds Bartok annoying and naive. After Bartok's
        show, a violent bear suddenly attacks. Bartok must save everyone by
        stunning the bear with dust and then knocks him over and traps him in a
        wagon.</image:caption
