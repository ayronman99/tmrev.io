        >The golden age of the annual Tony Awards ceremony lasted from 1967 to
        1986 â€” the period during which Alexander H. Cohen and his wife, Hildy
        Parks, were the producers of the show. This film offers a compilation of
        performances from Tony Award broadcasts during those years. They are
        presented with color-corrected footage and digitally re-mastered
        sound.</image:caption
