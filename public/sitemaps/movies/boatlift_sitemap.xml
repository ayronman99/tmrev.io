        >From the midst of 9/11, one of the darkest moments in American history,
        comes this inspiring and relatively unknown story. When the twin towers
        fell, hundreds of thousands of people ran to the water's edge. They soon
        realized that Manhattan is, indeed, an island. And that they were
        trapped. Within moments, an armada of every vessel that could get to the
        city's seawall spontaneously organized. Dashing into the teeth of
        danger, hundreds of boats pulled together and, without any formal
        planning, military or otherwise, they pulled off an ad-hoc sea
        evacuation that became the largest in history. Their story of courage
        and resolve reminds us of the powerful spirit that rose among us, on
        that fateful day. Narrated by Tom Hanks. Directed by Eddie
        Rosenstein.</image:caption
