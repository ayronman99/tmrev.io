        >This documentary is a journey into our own fascination, a collection of
        portraits of folk musicians living in New England, and a study of the

        a tribute to these musicians and a rare peep into the house parties and
        basement jams of New England, in the northwestern corner of the USA,
        with the vain hope attached that maybe you, the viewer, will grow as

        we were overwhelmed by the quality of their musical output. We were
        entranced by the melodies, harmonies, rhythms, and tempos and every
        other element that constitutes a song (or, as is often the case, a piece
        of abstract drone music, heavy feedback, or someone banging a steel pipe
