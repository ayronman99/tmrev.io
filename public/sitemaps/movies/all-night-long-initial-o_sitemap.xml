        >When a young woman witnesses a suicide she is so overwhelmed with
        sexual excitement that she masturbates, unaware that she is being
        observed by a strange man. Later he invites her home where she is wined
        and dined. Soon she wakes up to find herself locked in a cage. Of course
        their twisted and sadomasochistic relationship will end in a
        sadistically explicit bloodbath... The version of "All Night Long 5" I
        have is in Japanese, but the above synopsis is general gist. I'm a big
        fan of Katsuya Matsumura and I absolutely love the first three "All
        Night Long" movies."All Night Long R" is also pretty good whilst still
        being deeply disturbing.Unfortunately "Initial O" is too long and
        sometimes dull, so I was a little bit disappointed.Still there is plenty
        of sex and some unsettling sexual torture on display. There is not
        enough gore,but some scenes (for example throat slashing or castration)
        are particularly nasty.</image:caption
