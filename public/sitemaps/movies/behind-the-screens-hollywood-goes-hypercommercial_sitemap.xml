        >Hollywood movies are rapidly becoming vehicles for the ulterior
        marketing and advertising motives of studios and their owners, rather
        than entertainment in their own right. Behind the Screens explores this
        trend toward "hypercommercialism" through phenomena such as product
        placement, tie-ins, merchandising and cross-promotions. It combines
        multiple examples taken directly from the movies with incisive
        interviews provided by film scholars, cultural critics, political
        economists, and an Oscar-nominated screenwriter. Behind the Screens
        presents an accessible argument designed for school and college-age
        audiences-- precisely the demographic most prized by both Hollywood
        studios and advertisers alike. It features examples drawn from movies
        such as Wayne's World, Forrest Gump, The Lion King, Summer of Sam, and
        Toy Story.</image:caption
