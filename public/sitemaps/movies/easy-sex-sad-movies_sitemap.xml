        >Buenos Aires screenwriter Pablo is hired to write a new romantic
        comedy. As he begins his story, he visualizes his characters living in
        Madrid. Pablo creates a meet-cute between Marina and Víctor, a cute
        couple in Madrid who are soon totally in love. Yet as Pablo gets more
        and more into the script, he finds it difficult to separate his movie
        characters from what is happening in his own real life – specifically,
        his own love life.</image:caption
