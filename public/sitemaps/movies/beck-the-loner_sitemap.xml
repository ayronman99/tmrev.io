        >An Asian woman is found dead in the water of Stockholm's archipelago.
        She has been murdered and everything indicates that she was a
        prostitute. Meanwhile a series of break-ins has occurred on an island
        outside of Stockholm. Suddenly a retired old man is also found dead in
        his own yard. Now Beck has two cases to solve and they both point in the
        same direction.</image:caption
