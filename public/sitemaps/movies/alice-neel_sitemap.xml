        >The life and work of Alice Neel (1900-1984), American portrait painter.
        Part of the narration is chronological, part consists of interviews with
        friends, other artists, scholars, and family members, particularly two
        sons, Richard and Hartley, who are none too sanguine about their
        childhood and their mother's Bohemian life, and the filmmaker himself, a
        grandson whose querulous voice is heard from time to time. The film also
        includes footage of Neel, later in life, painting, talking, appearing on
        television, and giving lectures. Throughout, we see her paintings, bold,
        frank, and direct. After years of poverty and obscurity, fame comes as
        she nears 70.</image:caption
