        >In this Twilight Zone-esque thriller by director Travis B. Miller, five
        strangers awake in an abandon two-story house with a few unanswered
        questions racing through their minds. Who are they? Where are they? Why
        are they there? They soon discover that the obvious answers are not
        always the right ones. With nerves stretched thin, and time closing in,
        those remaining realize that if they want to escape from the forsaken
        place, they will have to work together to solve the puzzle, taking them
        on a psychological maze of murder and mayhem that is
        Purgatorium.</image:caption
