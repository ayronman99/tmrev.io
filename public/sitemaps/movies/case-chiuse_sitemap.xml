        >February 20, 1958: the Italian Parliament approved Law No. 75, the
        "Merlin Law": the end of an institution of Italian society for ages: the
        brothel. The Italian writer Dino Buzzati likens the event to the fire in
        the library of Alexandria in Egypt. The brothel is an institution that
        has spanned the centuries,thru different aspects, different forms. It is
        an institution that, in Italy, at least officially no longer exists. But
        it is also an institution that in other countries, still exists. The doc
        offers a journey that will start from the ruins of Pompeii brothel to
        get to the lights of Artemis in Berlin, with its soft drinks and its
        attention to the well-being and to the erotic papyrus from the Egyptian
        Museum of Turin and the giant Paradise in Girona, that El Pais has
        called the biggest brothel in Europe.</image:caption
