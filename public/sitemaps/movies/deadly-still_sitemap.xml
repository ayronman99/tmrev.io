        >A group of friends decide to spend a weekend together at a country
        house, but an unexpected accident forces them to stop at a strange and
        remote estate. In this abandoned and eerie place, a rare antique camera
        is discovered. Slowly the camera draws them into a mystical and tragic
        chain of events that none of them could have seen coming. Anyone who has
        their picture taken by the camera sees a photo revealing their death.
        Many of them lose their lives in excruciating ways, as they race to
        solve the mystery of the camera.</image:caption
