        >The story centers on a boy named Yamada Uro, and a 17-year old girl
        named Karon. Both work as part of the "Hero Retirement and Return to
        Everyday Life Assistance Agency," which takes heroes from another world
        back to Earth and helps them reintegrate into everyday life. Karon, a
        former hero herself, works under Uro as they tackle cases, and also
        lives with him, with Uro constantly failing to rein in Karon's hero-like
        behavior even as he tries to ingrain the behavior of common people into
        her.</image:caption
