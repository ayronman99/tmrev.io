        >Two chess players face off at a busy caf√©, studying both the pieces on
        the board and the unfolding dramas at the neighboring tables. While a
        young couple fumbles through an uncomfortable blind date, a longtime
        marriage begins to crumble. Meanwhile, a pair of film noir fans suspect
        they're witnessing a real-life murder. This is an ensemble drama about
        conversations overheard in a bustling New York City bistro. With every
        whispered word, we gain a greater understanding of the big picture being
        formed all around us. From lovers' quarrels to artistic musings and
        hushed confessions, a crowded restaurant is the perfect place to
        discover just what strangers will say when they think no one else is
        listening.</image:caption
