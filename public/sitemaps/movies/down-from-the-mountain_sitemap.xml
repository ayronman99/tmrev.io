        >On May 24, 2000, the historic Ryman Auditorium was booked to offer
        Nashvillians an evening of sublime beauty. Label executives and
        soundtrack producers so loved the music of O Brother, Where Art Thou?
        that they brought it to life as a benefit concert for the Country Music
        Hall of Fame. Filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen loved it so much that they
        hired famed documentary filmmaker D.A. Pennebaker to record the show for
        posterity. The concert that unfolded that night was one of the greatest
        musical moments in the annals of Music City. Performers: John Hartford,
        Alison Krauss, Emmylou Harris, Gillian Welch, Chris Thomas King, The Cox
        Family, Fairfield Four, Union Station, Colin Linden, The Nashville
        Bluegrass Band, The Peasall Sisters, Ralph Stanley, David Rawlings, The
        Whites.</image:caption
