        >Coming off the critically acclaimed run as the host of The Last Leg,
        comedian Adam Hills signed an exclusive one year deal with Channel 4.
        Alongside a Christmas Special of The Last Leg, Channel 4 showed this
        special featuring Adam Hills' live stand-up recorded at the Lyric
        Theatre in London's West End. Adam was joined on-stage throughout the
        recording by a British Sign Language signer, which provided some added
        fun in seeing what the signs for various rude words were.</image:caption
