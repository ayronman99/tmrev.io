        >Danny Krueger is a twenty-year old drag racer who plays by his own
        rules. After winning a scholarship to the prestigious Fast Lane Racing
        Academy, Danny finds himself competing against some of the fiercest
        young drivers in the world. Tension soars on and off the track, and a
        terrible incident leaves Danny without a racing partner. Facing
        dismissal from the academy, Danny is forced to team up with an old
        rival. The pair must learn to set aside their differences as they vie
        for rookie spots on a professional racing team.</image:caption
