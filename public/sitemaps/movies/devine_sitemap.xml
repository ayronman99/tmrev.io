        >On a Sunday night, in a large town, an idle quartet, a girl and three
        boys are mimicking movie titles. They are still at the age when you play
        to cross the nights. It is an age when people stay together not to come
        home alone. Through the game, their feelings unveil and reveal
        incompatible loves. Nothing will ever be the same. Only a dance with a
        melancholic scent could bring them together one last time. Trying to
        retain the youth that is running away from them.</image:caption
