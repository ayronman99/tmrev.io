        >In 1960, Yazid joined the first group to explore Felda in Bilut. Yazid
        had to face all kinds of challenges and emotional stress. His best
        friend, Jim died crushed trees. Storm destroyed their home. My youngest
        son, Jamin, died devoured by tigers. At the same time, Yazid got to know
        some of the settlers who conspires resell fertilizer subsidy given by
        the government to reap short-term profits. Yazid also tried vilified by
        his own friend, Hamza's claim that he was illegally selling the
        fertilizer subsidy. Not only that, they also face the danger when there
        are still remnants of the communist party in the forest.</image:caption
