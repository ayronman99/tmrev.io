        >‘Critical Moment One’ was an un-planned recording of a one-year old boy
        exploring shells and sand on a beach. Though the boy was my own
        grand-son, it was never seen as a ‘home-movie’ – the child’s face is
        never seen and it was shot over his shoulder - as close to his
        ‘point-of-view’ as I could get. As a young man and as my own children
        grew up, I was greatly intrigued by the book ‘The Construction of
        Reality in the Child’ by Swiss psychologist, Jean Piaget. Piaget made an
        exceptionally close observation of the changing stages of behavior of
        his own children which provided me with a conceptual framework for my
        own observations.</image:caption
