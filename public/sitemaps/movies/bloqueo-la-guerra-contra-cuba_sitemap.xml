        >This documentary consists of interviews with various Cuban
        functionaries, scientists and artists, plus a few minutes of newsreel
        footage. The interviews are brisk and to the point and they add up to a
        coherent whole. There is perhaps not much new material, but the
        labyrinthine details of the embargo, still in place, deserve exposure.
        The US though the blockade would turn the people of Cuba against its own
        government. A bully's reasoning; it was of course wrong. Undeterred, and
        unable to learn, the US has since insisted again and again, the last two
        instances Iran and now Russia.</image:caption
