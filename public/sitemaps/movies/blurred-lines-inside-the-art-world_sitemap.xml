        >As one art scene insider proclaims, the contemporary art world can be
        summed up as “rich people trying to prove how rich they are,” but is
        that all there is to this billion dollar industry? Well-researched and
        expertly constructed, Barry Avrich’s eye-opening documentary peels back
        the layers of the art world economy- from production to circulation, and
        delineates every integral player in the game of art-making, including
        curators, gallerists, collectors, donors, auction houses, and … artists.
        In the process, he unpacks the complex and surprising ecosystem that
        supports the art world superstars and million-dollar deals that make
        front-page news. Featuring extraordinary access to industry players and
        candid statements from prominent artists like Damien Hirst, Julian
        Schnabel, Taryn Simon, and Marina Abramovic, Blurred Lines collides the
        two narratives of the art world as both above and beholden to market
        forces.</image:caption
