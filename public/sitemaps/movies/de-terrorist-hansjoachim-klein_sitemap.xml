        >On December 21, 1975, six terrorists from the Revolutionary Cells, led
        by Carlos 'The Jackal' forced their way into the conference room of the
        OPEC headquarters in Vienna and took seventy ministers hostage. A gun
        battle with the police ensued, and three people were killed. One
        terrorist was seriously wounded. The terrorists managed to escape to
        Algiers with a few hostages and the wounded man. There the hostages were
        released. The wounded terrorist was Hans-Joachim Klein. At the moment
        that Klein arrived in Algiers, he decided to quit
        terrorism.</image:caption
