        >Choir leader Ylva and her choir are on a bus bound for Italy. Some of
        the members on the bus are looking forward to meeting the local mayor,
        others are just hoping for a free vacation, and yet a few more are still
        thinking that they're headed to Italy to sing. Common to them all is
        that they are more than happy to jump on this chance to escape their
        every day lives. Ylva too is one them. She wants to get away as soon as
        possible because she caught her husband in bed with the babysitter.
        She'll find that the young Erik and Ruben who join the choir for her are
        more than willing to offer her an adventure. The rest is made up of a
        sex-crowded pair, the couple who have not been with each other for
        years, the divorced woman who long for a man and the lesbian who did not
        dare come out.</image:caption
