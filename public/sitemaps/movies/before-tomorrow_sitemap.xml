        >Two isolated families meet for a summertime celebration. Food is
        abundant and the future seems bright, but Ningiuq, a wise old woman,
        sees her world as fragile and moves through it with a pervasive sense of
        dread. Ningiuq and her grandson Maniq are dropped off on a remote
        island, where, every year, the family dries the catch and stores it for
        winter. The task is soon finished. As summer turns to fall, they wait in
        vain for the others to pick them up. Written by Anonymous
