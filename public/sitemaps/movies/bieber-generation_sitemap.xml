        >This documentary film attempts to analyze the dynamics of a massive
        fan-base; it focuses on the Beliebers (fans of Justin Bieber). The
        Beliebers are one of the largest fan-bases on the planet, they dominate
        social media and it seems that almost everyone has an opinion about
        them. Beliebers feel that they are generalized about and attempt to help
        non-Beliebers understand them through this film. From the charity work
        they do to the bullying they receive, the film attempts to uncover all
        of it by talking to Beliebers and non-Beliebers from around the world
        and sharing their experiences. Although the film will appeal to
        Beliebers, it is also targeted at those attempting to understand such
        phenomena and promotes communication and understanding from an unbiased
        position in general.</image:caption
