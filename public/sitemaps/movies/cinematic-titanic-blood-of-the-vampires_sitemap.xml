        >The Escodero family is cursed!The mother, whom the Escodero children
        assumed to be dead, is actually an undead vampire who lurks in a secret
        basement/dungeon hidden from the rest of the house. When the kids
        discover this dark truth, all hell breaks loose...literally! The mother
        bites the son, who grows fangs and becomes consumed with blood lust.
        Meanwhile, all this vampire activity wreaks havoc on the daughter's
        romance with her handsome, dashing fiance. It all leads to a foray into
        the occult that ultimately proves true love can live on forever, but not
        before a mob of angry villagers and avenging priests take on the Devil
        himself in a climactic battle between good and evil. Set in nineteenth
        century Mexico and performed by a Filipino cast, "Blood of the Vampires"
        has something for everyone: blood-soaked action for the guys, tender
        romance for the ladies, and unleashed demonic rage for the frightened
        child within us all.</image:caption
