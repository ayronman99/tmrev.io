        >Danny Bishop is a gambling prodigy. After exiling himself to prison, he
        returns to his brothers home only to find himself back in the game
        because of a large debt for his protection in prison. He cons a group of
        high stakes gamblers, including his vicious rival, Alex, to a
        tournament. The story is a delicate balance between the tension of the
        game and the strained relationship with his brother.</image:caption
