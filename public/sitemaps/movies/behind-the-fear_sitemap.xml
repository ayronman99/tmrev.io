        >Behind The Fear uncovers the hidden controversy about HIV that the
        United States government doesn't want you to know exists; since the
        beginning of the HIV epidemic, top scientists and doctors have
        questioned the validity of HIV as a deadly virus, or even as a virus
        that exists at all. Nicole Zwiren takes on the topic of whether or not
        HIV is really a harmful virus, by interviewing doctors, scientists,
        journalists, and patients who have been involved in HIV's history, and
        she presents information that helps the viewer decide what to believe.
