        >From the shadows of the majestic Pamir Mountains of Tajikistan comes a
        story of Azam, a shepherd and Buzkashi champion, who faces the pressures
        of modernization in the sport and in his own personal life. Azam plays
        as an individual for honor and integrity, but his success is
        increasingly thwarted by organized alliances, or "mafias", encouraged by
        his rival Khurshed, a member of Tajikistan's nouveau riche. Khurshed
        believes that team play is the future of the sport. Between challenges
        on the field and within his own family, Azam tries to find a place for
        himself in the new Tajikistan. Written by Najeeb Mirza</image:caption
