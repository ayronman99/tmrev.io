        >Kang Hyeon-joong, a former National Intelligence Service agent, is
        currently running a private investigator office after he quit. Ha Mi-so
        is his secretary helping him with his daily tasks in the office. One
        day, a woman whose name is Yoo-ra visits the office and requests him to
        investigate about a man named Min-ho, whom she loves. She wanted to know
        what Min-ho really thinks about her. She says she is scared and
        concerned that he might think she approached him because she wanted the
        assets of his wealthy family. So she wanted to confirm if he actually
        loves her. In the afternoon on the same day, Min-ho comes to the same
        office and makes a request to investigate about Yoo-raâ€™s inner thoughts.
        Kang Hyeon-joong is perplexed as he received the same request from a
        couple separately on the same day. But he shortly realizes there is
        something strange in the stories from both of them and this situation is
        all because of a plan someone has plotted deliberately.</image:caption
