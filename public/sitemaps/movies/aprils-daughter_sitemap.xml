        >Valeria is 17 and pregnant. She lives in Puerto Vallarta with Clara,
        her half sister. Valeria has not wanted her long-absent mother, April,
        to find out about her pregnancy, but due to the economic strain and the
        overwhelming responsibility of having a baby in the house, Clara decides
        to call their mother. April arrives, willing to her daughters, but we
        soon understand why Valeria had wanted her to stay away.</image:caption
