        >It took his whole life to live and three full years to film Chuck
        Leavell: The Tree Man. Filmed in four countries with more than 80
        interviews from artists with a combined 58 Grammy Awards by the artist
        included, “Chuck Leavell: The Tree Man,” an Allen Farst film, is the
        cinematic documentary that shines a light on one of the greatest rock’n
        roll pianists and keyboardists over the last 40 years. Not just known
        for his musical influence, Leavell is also one of the biggest names in
        environmental forestry and was selected the National Tree Farmer of the
        Year in the United States. -His commitment to the planet and his strong
        family ties are refreshing reminders to be kind and treat your neighbor
        with respect. As Leavell puts it, “if you cut a tree down, plant two for
        the next guy.”</image:caption
