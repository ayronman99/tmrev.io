        >Sophie Bennett begins a new holiday tradition of spending every holiday
        at the Evergreen Inn and Ski Lodge, which she inherited from her
        parents. Evergreen Inn is a special place filled with people who cannot
        make it home for the holidays or who have had such wonderful experiences
        that it has become their home-away-from-holiday-home. This Christmas,
        Sophie will meet an unforgettable family, and her own life will be
        forever changed.</image:caption
