        >In Distance Between Dreams, the most historic year in big wave surfing
        comes to life through the eyes of iconic surfer Ian Walsh, as he sets
        mind and body in motion to redefine the upper limits of what's
        considered 'rideable.' With massive El Ni√±o powered swells building
        across the Pacific, Ian, Shaun, D.K. and Luke Walsh band together in the
        way only brothers can on a quest to progress surfing to unimaginable
        heights. Big wave surfing's transition from jet ski assists to paddling
        in raises the stakes, putting Walsh's intense physical and mental
        training, the latest technology, swell modeling, and safety team, his
        brothers, to the ultimate test. Surfers John John Florence, Greg Long,
        Shane Dorian and more link up with Walsh as he rides an emotional
        rollercoaster through this momentous winter.</image:caption
