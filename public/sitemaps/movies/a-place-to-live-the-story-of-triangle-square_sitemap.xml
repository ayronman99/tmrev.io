        >A Place to Live: The Story of Triangle Square chronicles the journey of
        seven brave individuals as they attempt to secure a home in Triangle
        Square, Hollywood, the nation's first affordable housing facility for
        LGBT seniors. Since demand far exceeds the number of available
        apartments, a lottery system was set up to determine who would be
        selected. This film is a moving exploration of the applicants' personal
        stories and the journey that brought them to the lottery and what the
        future might hold.</image:caption
