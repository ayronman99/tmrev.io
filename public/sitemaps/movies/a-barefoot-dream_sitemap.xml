        >After a series of pipe dream ventures go belly up, retired pro soccer
        player Kim Won-kang happens to visit East Timor, where he finds children
        playing the game barefoot on rocky pitches. Sensing a new business
        opportunity on finding the country doesn't have a single sporting goods
        store, he embarks on a scheme to get rich quick by purveying athletic
        shoes to the unshod youngsters. Sadly, no one there can afford to pay
        $60 for a pair of shoes, even on a generous installment plan, and before
        he knows it, he is reduced to coaching a team of ragged 10-year-olds and
        prospects are looking grim. Written by Palm Springs Internation Film
