        >For Jeremy Clarkson's new DVD he has traveled the Planet - from Spain
        via Strasbourg to Swindon - for the Supercar Showdown to beat them all.
        His aim is simple - find the ultimate Supercar. Jeremy starts a fight
        between the Ferrari 430 and Lamborghini Gallardo. The Gallardo's big
        cousin, the Murcielago, weighs in too. The Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano
        struts its stuff and Audi's R8 faces up to the Porsche GT3 as special
        guest, Nurburgring-know-all Sabine Schmitz takes on The Stig. Jeremy
        also turns into a Formula 1 hero thanks to a Radical SR3. And has a
        fantastic time in the Aston Martin Vantage V8 Roadster. Plus there's a
        new kid on the block in the shape of the stunning Ascari A10. And the
        line-up would not be complete without the 1000 horsepower, 252 miles per
        hour Bugatti Veyron. Meanwhile, everything else explodes as Jeremy finds
        out if there is such a thing as "Too much" turbo power, a Renault Alpine
        A610 comes to the end of the road.</image:caption
