        >On November 16th, Amon Amarth will release their new documentary and
        supporting live album(s), The Pursuit Of Vikings: 25 Years In The Eye Of
        The Storm – which includes a retrospective documentary that features a
        wealth of live and behind-the-scenes content and extensive band
        interviews. This film tells the Swedish quintet’s history, through both
        their own eyes and those of the fans that have supported them along the
        way. It is a thrilling collection that pays respect to the faithful, as
        well as making for a detailed and riveting introduction for those new to
        their inspiring story. Paired with this documentary is the live
        video/audio, which contains two different sets at 2017′s Summer Breeze
        Festival in Dinkelsbuhl, Germany, capturing the unit at their very
        best.</image:caption
