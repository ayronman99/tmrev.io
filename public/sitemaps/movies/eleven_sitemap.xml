        >2Eleven is the tale of two brothers hustling to survive in the streets
        of Detroit. Zo, the calm, ambitious brother, wants nothing more than to
        give his daughter, Natty, a better life while Murda, the flashy, hot
        tempered brother, loves the fast life and even faster money. Two very
        different brothers with the same occupation, committing robberies. Zo,
        Murda, and their accomplice Rell start off as small time thieves until
        Zo links up with a season veteran who gives them the opportunity to
        catch bigger fish and make more money. Once these "jack boys" begin to
        see a shift in income, the differences between Zo and Murda become more
        apparent. Tempers flare, blood is shed, and lines are crossed. The more
        money that is made, the more loyalty is tested. This urban drama is sure
        to leave you thinking.</image:caption
