        >A documentary that traces the history of Club Q, the legendary dance
        party for lesbian women and their friends. Held on the first Friday of
        every month, Q attracted over 1,000 lesbian women of all colors, ages,
        sizes and backgrounds, to dance, sweat and celebrate inside the
        pulsating beat of high-energy dance music. Q was a one-of-a-kind
        phenomenon for two reasons: First, because of the sheer number and
        diversity of lesbian women who attended. And second, because of its
        longevity - the club lasted for 15 years! Q's ability to maintain not
        only its diverse clientele, but also its vitality in San Francisco's
        ever-changing club scene made it a cultural and historical
        marvel.</image:caption
