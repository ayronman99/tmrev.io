        >Hello everybody, Now then as some of you might know, I was made to go
        off round the country earlier on this year and do a show to loads of
        people. It wasn't my idea, I was made to do it by that lot what pull all
        the strings. I went everywhere, up north, down south and I even had to
        go to Scotland, but you have to do these things you see. If I'd have had
        my way I wouldn't have gone, I'd have stayed at home with my feet up
        watching Dragons Den with a box of Magnums, but it wasn't my way..So in
        the end what happened was, I got to this one place in Digbeth, which is
        in Birmingham and they've got a load of video cameras there and they say
        right we're gonna film this and I shrugged my shoulders and said OK. So
        they did and this is what you've got in your hands, the DVD of it, so
        have a look at it and see what you think. OK bye, From
        Angelos</image:caption
