        >Jonathan Mercer is a normal everyday guy with problems, but none
        greater than the day his wife Rain was diagnosed with a rare form of
        cancer. He turns to his lifelong friend and fight promoter, Grant for an
        answer, but it turns out to be more than he bargained for. Thrust into a
        world of underground street fighting, Jon must risk his life to raise
        money, save his love. Jon's sister, FBI agent Robyn Mercer is
        investigating the head of the fight league, King. Together with his
        enforcer Abel, they are responsible for the murders of countless
        fighters. After a brutal defeat, Jon is trained by Soleem and returns to
        the underground circuit to win it all - but at what cost?</image:caption
