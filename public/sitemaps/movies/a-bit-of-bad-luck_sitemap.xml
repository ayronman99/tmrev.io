        >Brooks Caldwell, (Cary Elwes) an erudite and handsome lawyer, seems to
        have it all: wealth, social status and a red hot career. His success is,
        in reality, a product of his marriage to his beautiful, socialite wife,
        Amanda, (Terri Polo) a wealthy timber heiress. Unlike most, who would
        remain content to enjoy a life of luxury and privilege, Brooks continues
        to risk everything by having extramarital affairs. Brooks' philandering,
        in addition to humiliating Amanda, has driven her to the point of a
        mental breakdown. Having been pushed over the edge, Amanda orchestrates
        a just and elaborate plan to bring her husband down. When Brooks leaves
        for a weekend romp with his latest squeeze, (Agnes Bruckner) his life
        quickly descends into a bizarre, nightmarish, downward
        spiral.</image:caption
