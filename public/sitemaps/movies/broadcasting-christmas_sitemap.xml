        >When the opportunity to co-host a talk show with the fabulous talk show
        diva Veronika presents itself two weeks before Christmas, Emily thinks
        this is her big break. To her surprise, she discovers she has stiff
        competition with Charlie, the local TV anchor who is her near equal on
        another station. With such interest and support for both reporters, a
        contest is created: for the two weeks leading up to Christmas, who can
        cover the best and most meaningful Christmas stories on the local
        news?</image:caption
