        >We call them o-rang-u-tans, which literally means "forest persons" in
        the Malay and Indonesian languages. They are the only great apes native
        to Asia. Of all the apes, they are the closest to man in genetic makeup.
        And they face extinction. Two years in the making, the film is an
        intimate portrayal of the world of orangutans, the threats to their
        survival and the people committed to help them thrive. The film focuses
        on a recent discovery that orangutans do not rely on animal instinct for
        survival, but instead have a culture that they have preserved from
        generation to generation.</image:caption
