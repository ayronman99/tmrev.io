        >Alex, Carrie and Andy, a group of middle of the road, Hollywood
        wannabes, spend their time waiting for their number to come up in a town
        that's full of rejection. While Carrie is trying to get a record deal
        through intimate relations and Andy endures humiliating auditions on his
        way to being a mega star, It's the new comer, Alex, who tries to make
        sense out of this place by writing his first screenplay.</image:caption
