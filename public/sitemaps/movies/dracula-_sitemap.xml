        >In the year 3000, the deep space salvage ship Mother III locates the
        vanished starship Demeter in the Carpathian System. Captain Abraham Van
        Helsing and his crew composed of the blonde assistant Aurora Ash; the
        crippled navigator Arthur "The Professor" Holmwood, who believes that he
        is a genius; the strong and dumb Humvee; the intern Mina Murry; and the
        drug addicted 187, decide to claim the possession of Demeter. While
        exploring the spacecraft, they see a tape of fifty years ago of Captain
        Varna telling that he was locked in his cabin since his crew was acting
        weird after getting a cargo of coffins in Transylvania station. When 187
        decides to search in the coffins for some possible hidden dope, he cuts
        his hand and his blood awakes Count Orlock, a.k.a. Count Dracula. When
        Aurora discloses who Dracula is, the survivors try to find a way to
        destroy the vampire.</image:caption
