        >Jane appears to be ideal: attractive, intelligent, unruffled by her
        employer's abrupt eccentricities. But, gradually, we come aware that
        Jane has another agenda. Incrementally, Sir Paul's familiar surroundings

        around the house and he becomes increasingly dependent on his new
        assistant.</image:caption
