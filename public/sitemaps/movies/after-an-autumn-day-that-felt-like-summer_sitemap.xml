        >September 11th has left Ellsworth a shell-shocked mess. Not only is he
        struggling to process his feelings about the event, but he is unable to
        return to a normal life and his relationship with his live-in girlfriend
        Eleanor is suffering. After returning to the Manhattan street corner
        where he witnessed the horrific attack, Ellsworth visits Anne, the woman
        with whom he is having an affair. His questioning of everything that
        Americans cherish is met with disinterest by Anne, who leaves to
        rehearse a fan dance with her burlesque company. Returning home, Anne
        and Ellsworth are confronted by Eleanor. Unwilling to converse or
        compromise, Eleanor demands that he instantly choose between
        them.</image:caption
