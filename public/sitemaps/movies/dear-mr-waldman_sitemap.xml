        >Set in early-1960s Tel Aviv, this coming-of-age story centers on
        10-year-old Hilik and his struggle to help heal the emotional wounds of
        his father, who hasn't recovered from losing his elder son at Auschwitz.
        Still in denial, Moishe believes his son escaped and is now President
        Kennedy's aide. To help his father move on and gain the father-son
        relationship he sorely needs, Hilik puts Moishe's love to the
        test.</image:caption
