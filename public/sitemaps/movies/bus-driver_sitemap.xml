        >A high school bus on its way to a retreat blows a tire and stops at the
        nearest ranch for help. The driver, five troubled students, and their
        ridiculous gym- teacher chaperone find, instead, criminals who will stop
        at nothing to make sure their drug operations aren't discovered. The
        students and teacher are easy prey for these animals, but standing in
        the way of certain death is a force more determined and more skilled
        than any of them ever expected: The Bus Driver.</image:caption
