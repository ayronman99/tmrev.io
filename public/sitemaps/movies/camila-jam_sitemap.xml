        >Camila is in her mid-twenties and her life has been thrown into chaos
        ever since her boyfriend threw her out of their apartment during a
        bitter argument. Camila's ambition is to become a writer, and she posts
        regularly on her blog, entitled "Camila Jam." However, Camila wants to
        take her work into a different direction, and she throws herself head
        first into life in search of inspiration. As Camila struggles with
        alcohol, unsettled emotions and relationships with abusive men, it
        becomes increasingly obvious that her skills as a writer aren't all she
        needs to sort out if she wants to truly understand her life and her
        career.</image:caption
