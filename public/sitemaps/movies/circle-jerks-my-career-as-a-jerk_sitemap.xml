        >From the beginning, LA punk band the Circle Jerks were rooted in
        controversy. Formed by ex members of Black Flag and Red Cross (now Redd
        Kross) in late 1979, the band came to encapsulate the image, sound and
        energy of California Hardcore Punk. Filmmaker David Markey (1991: The
        Year Punk Broke, The Slog Movie) mixes in-depth interviews, rare live
        footage and historical perspective to illustrate the story of one of the
        most influential bands in the American underground. My Career as a Jerk
        follows the band from their early days and classic debut to navigating
        the independent label and touring scene of the 80s to the addictions,
        fights and injuries that forced their break up. Of course the story
        doesn't quite end there.</image:caption
