        >On May 19, 1984, an out of work ice cream truck driver from
        Southwestern Ohio broke the bank on CBS' hit game show of the mid-1980's
        "Press Your Luck" and made TV history by setting a record for the most
        money won by a contestant in one appearance on a daytime game show; A
        record which may have been long been surpassed with the Big-Jackpot game
        shows of today, but still stands strong as the biggest win in "Press
        Your Luck's" history. Was it brilliance? Was it cheating? And how did he
        do it? "Press Your Luck's" host and crew, the family of Michael Larson -
        the man who walked away with $110,237 in cash and prizes - and Michael's
        opponents from that fateful day gathered in Hollywood 19 years later to
        relive the events of that remarkable event in TV history.</image:caption
