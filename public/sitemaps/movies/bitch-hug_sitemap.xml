        >Kristin counts down the days to her high school graduation, when she'll
        finally get to leave her small town and her manipulative sister behind,
        for the New York of her dreams. Everything is perfect, and the local
        paper has promised to publish Kristin's columns about the city that
        never sleeps. But Kristin misses her flight and, to escape total
        humiliation, instead ends up hiding out at the house of the peculiar
        young girl Andrea, far out on the countryside. In this house of Nowhere,
        Kristin brings Andrea along to the pulsating heart of New York on a big
        virtual adventure which she chronicles for everyone at home to follow.
        But then reality comes knocking.</image:caption
