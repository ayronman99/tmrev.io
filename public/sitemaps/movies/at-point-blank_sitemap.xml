        >A gang of highly efficient and cold hearted robbers strike against a
        number of banks in Stockholm. The investigation ends up with the
        criminal detective Klara and the SWAT commander Greger Krona, who
        together lead the hunt for the robbers. Their investigation takes them
        in a dangerous direction that proves to have unforeseen consequences.
        The hunt for the robbers is intense and their methods become more
        refined and terrifying. Klara ends up in the line of fire, both
        literally and figuratively, and the investigation takes her in a
        direction that she could never have imagined.</image:caption
