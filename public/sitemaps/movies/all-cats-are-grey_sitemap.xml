        >Paul is a chubby kind-­‐hearted amateur detective. Dorothy is an
        intense upper class teenager. Paul is into quoting Sherlock Holmes and
        watching Derrick. Dorothy is into punk clothing and hating her mother.
        Paul is forty three, Dorothy is sixteen, and the only thing that links
        them is Paul’s knowledge that he is Dorothy’s biological father… over
        time, this has grown into a one way relationship with Paul spying on
        Dorothy as she grew up, always from a safe distance…They would never
        have met if Dorothy hadn’t heard of Paul’s amateur detective skills. She
        wants to use him to find her father…</image:caption
