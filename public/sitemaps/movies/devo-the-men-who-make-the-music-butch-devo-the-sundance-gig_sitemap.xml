        >The Men Who Make the Music combines concert footage from DEVO's 1978
        tour with music videos and interstitials featuring a vague story about
        DEVO's rocky relationship with ""Big Entertainment."" As for the bonus
        program, Butch Devo and the Sundance Gig, Jerry Casale says, ""In '96,
        we closed Sundance Film Festival. We wore 20s style prison suits, we did
        a special show with really old, hardcore Devo songs from the early 70s,
        before we ever had a deal.</image:caption
