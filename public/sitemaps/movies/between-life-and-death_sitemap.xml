        >Provocative documentary following the doctors who can now interrupt,
        and even reverse, the process of death. Filmed over six months in the
        country's leading brain injury unit (Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge),
        it follows the journey of a man who, by only moving his eyes, is
        eventually asked if he wants to live or die. Two other families are also
        plunged into the most ethically difficult decision in modern
        medicine.</image:caption
