        >Radim Labudaâ€™s early works are characterized by a process of
        observation focusing on surrounding world or due to its performative
        overlap also to the artist himself. Camera means for Labuda a means of
        exploring the surrounding world or even own introspection. Three videos
        of performative sculpture events consisting in modelling a chewing gum
        in a mouth were recorded by Labuda during his art fellowship in San
        Francisco in 2004.</image:caption
