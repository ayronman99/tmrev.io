        >Inspired by a true story, "Chasing the Green" tells the story of two
        young brothers who become millionaires during the early 1990s. Their
        ambition and drive lead them into conflict with FTC officials, where an
        over-zealous bureaucrat attempts to destroy their company. The older
        brother, tries to reconcile the current crisis with conflicts in his own
        relationships, primarily with his current girlfriend.</image:caption
