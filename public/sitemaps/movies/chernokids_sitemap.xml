        >In Ukraine, three deformed orphans decide to visit their mother. The
        first one has several eyes on his head and a disgusting fish in his
        aquarium; the second has deformed legs; the third one has two heads.
        They walk to a Nuclear Power Plant that they believe is their mother.
        However they are rescued and brought back to the orphanage where a boy
        with deformed teeth mocks them all.</image:caption
