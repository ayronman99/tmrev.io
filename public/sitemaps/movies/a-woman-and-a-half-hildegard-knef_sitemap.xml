        >Hildegard Knef: legendary German film diva. An actress whose
        personality is as complex as the characters she has played. She is by
        turns irritable, impatient, charming, humorous, fascinating and
        enchanting. But behind the many masks is the temperamental woman, the
        Hildegard Knef who has weathered many of lifeâ€²s blows: failure in
        Hollywood, cancer, lost loves, the enmity of the press and, finally, the
        horror of aging. A Woman and a Half - Hildegard Knef is the portrait of
        a Knef who has become cynical and unpredictable in order to protect
        herself, but also a Knef full of warmth, humor and
        spirit.</image:caption
