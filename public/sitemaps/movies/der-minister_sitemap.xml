        >Franz Ferdinand von und zu Donnersberg is a charismatic, well-bred and
        handsome young man from a very wealthy family who sees his future in
        politics. His childhood friend Max Drexel is quick-witted, ambitious,
        quick-witted, but comes from a humble background and doesn't like to be
        in the foreground. But together they make an unbeatable team, as Max
        runs his office and writes him the tangled and grandiose speeches that
        Franz Ferdinand gets so much applause and recognition for. But
        Chancellor Angela Murkel eyes the young MP with great skepticism. Franz
        Ferdinand realizes that he could improve his reputation with the
        chancellor with a doctorate</image:caption
