        >Our civilization as we know it emerged as if by magic. For millennia
        ancient man hunted and gathered but, after thousands of generations,
        mankind suddenly settled down and as if from nowhere. Suddenly, complex
        tools, art, literature, agriculture, math, astronomy and massive
        monuments to the gods appear out of ancient Sumeria. The same Gods the
        Sumerian clay tablets civilization emerged tell us had come down to
        Earth from heaven to give us knowledge and life. We are now discovering
        evidence of mankind's legacy that differs from the doctrine we've been
        told for millennia and that the truth is stranger than fiction. Our
        pantheon of Gods may themselves have been descendants from Alien beings
        and it's clear now that our history goes back thousands of years more
        than previously thought.</image:caption
