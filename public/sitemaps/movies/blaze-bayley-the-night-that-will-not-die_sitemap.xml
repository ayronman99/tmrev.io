        >Since splitting with Maiden, Blaze Bayley has released a series of well
        received solo albums under the Blaze Bayley moniker. With his new DVD,
        "The Night That Would Not Die," he attempts to prove that he can hold
        his own with some of the biggest names out there. The concert was filmed
        in Prateln, Switzerland in December of 2008 and shows Blaze and company
        performing to a packed venue. The show opens with the title track from
        his latest album, "The Man Who Would Not Die" and the crowd blatantly
        loves every second of it.</image:caption
