        >Ten years later, the events of September 11, 2001, still resonate -
        especially for the people who were in critical leadership positions on
        that fateful day. Hear intimate accounts from New York Mayor Rudy
        Giuliani and the chiefs of the NYPD and FDNY, Secretary of Defense
        Donald Rumsfeld, Vice President Dick Cheney and many others who found
        themselves at the center of the action. Unprecedented decisions.
        Unimaginable tragedy. This is the definitive story, from 6 am to
        midnight, of a day that changed the world.</image:caption
