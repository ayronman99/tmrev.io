        >When corporate executives are blackmailed into public displays of
        nudity on the busy streets of Shinjuku, the big guns are called out to
        locate "Oboreru Sakana". The "big guns" are a misfit duo of ethically
        questionable characters who must infiltrate a gay nightclub and "fit in"
        while they search for clues. What ensues is both hilarious and
        action-packed. Oboreru Sakana is a rather ambitious and often hilarious
        contemporary crime thriller. Its narrative swings from the grisly to the
        humorous and pulls in as many pop culture elements as it can
        manage.</image:caption
