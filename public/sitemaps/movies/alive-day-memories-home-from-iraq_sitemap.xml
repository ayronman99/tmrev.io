        >In a war that has left more than 25,000 wounded, ALIVE DAY MEMORIES:
        HOME FROM IRAQ looks at a new generation of veterans. Executive Producer
        James Gandolfini interviews ten Soldiers and Marines who reveal their
        feelings on their future, their severe disabilities and their devotion
        to America. The documentary surveys the physical and emotional cost of
        war through memories of their "alive day," the day they narrowly escaped
        death in Iraq.</image:caption
