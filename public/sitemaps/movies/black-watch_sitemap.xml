        >The stunning BBC TV production of the National Theatre of Scotland s
        urgently topical play. Hurtling from a pool room in Fife to an armoured
        wagon in Iraq, Black Watch is based on interviews conducted by Gregory
        Burke with former soldiers who served in Iraq. Viewed through the eyes
        of those on the ground, Black Watch reveals what it means to be part of
        the legendary Scottish regiment, what it means to be part of the war on
        terror and what it means to make the journey home again. John Tiffany s
        production makes powerful and inventive use of movement, music and song
        to create a visceral, complex and urgent piece of theatre. This is a
        show that brings together Scotland s military history and its proud
        tradition of popular, political theatre to address one of the thorniest
        issues of our time.</image:caption
