        just doesn't care anymore. In the opening scene of Death Inhabits at
        Night, the unemployed writer pours himself another glass of cheap wine
        as an upstairs neighbour leaps to his death. His girlfriend is clearly
        more upset by the incident. A little later, she finds a letter by the
        door reminding them to pay the rent or be evicted. Raúl shrugs and
        suggests going back to bed. But all of this dismissiveness changes
        following a meeting with a troubled young girl.</image:caption
