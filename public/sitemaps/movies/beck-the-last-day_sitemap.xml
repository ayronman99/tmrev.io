        >Two traffic officers on a quiet morning shift try to stop a car for
        speeding. When the car finally pulls over, the driver gets out and
        shoots at them, killing one of the officers in cold blood. A national
        alert is issued and an extensive search for the ruthless killer begins,
        with the Beck group at the lead. Neither the officer’s shocked and
        wounded colleague nor any of the witnesses have seen anything helpful to
        the police. Finally, they find the car registration number using a
        surveillance camera. But, when they enter the car owner’s apartment,
        they find him shot to death. The first day of summer is a long one for
        the Beck group, as the killer has more victims on his
        list.</image:caption
