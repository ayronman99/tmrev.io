        >Komari Sano's parents ran a small Tokyo factory that manufactured
        aircraft parts. With her parents' influence, Komari Sano dreamed of
        becoming a pilot. During World War II, her older brother died as a
        kamikaze pilot and her parents died during the bombing of Tokyo. Komari
        Sano became an orphan and lived with her aunt. Her aunt ran a ryotei
        (high end traditional restaurant). After the war, all aerial activities
        were initially banned in Japan. After long negotiations with the Supreme
        Commander of the Allied Powers, Sizuo Matsuki, who is the security chief
        of Civil Aviation Bureau, finally launched Japan's civil aviation.
