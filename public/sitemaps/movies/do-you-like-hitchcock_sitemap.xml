        >In 1990, as a boy, Giulio was chased through the woods by two women
        after spying on them practicing witchcraft. Now a young film student in
        Turin, he watches his neighbors in the flats across from his third floor
        apartment, especially Sasha when she's naked or arguing with her mother.
        Giulio's girlfriend is disgusted with his voyeurism, but, after a murder
        occurs, Giulio is convinced that two relative strangers, just as in
        Hitchcock and Highsmith's "Strangers in a Train," have agreed to murder
        each other's bÃªte noir. He follows his suspects, ends up with an
        intruder and a broken foot, and may be in real danger. Is he more than a
        peeping Tom?</image:caption
