        >This is a story about a unique crew of Dorset Bus Drivers whose amateur
        dramatics group decide to ditch doing another pantomime and try
        something different. They spent a year creating a serious adaptation of
        the sci-fi, horror film, Alien; finding ingenious solutions to pay
        homemade, homage to the original film. The show is a crushing flop but
        fate gives them a second chance to find their audience. Whilst still
        adjusting to the idea that their serious show is actually a comedy, the
        group find out they’re suddenly being whisked from their village hall to
        a London West End theatre to perform this accidental masterpiece for one
        night only. With wobbly sets, awkward acting and special effects
        requiring 'more luck than judgement’, will their West End debut be
        alright on the night? This bus driving crew are our space heroes. Their
        bus station is our space station. Dorset is outer-space and where is the
        Alien? It’s behind you!</image:caption
