        >"A form emerging from the cinematographic material paces mountain
        trails. Singular irruption that disappears and blends into nature and
        its representation. There is no more separation, or so little, between
        being and the world, yet irreconcilable. The voice is tense, it becomes
        this arc between nature and the character that seems to bring back to
        the surface of the screen cinematic flashes forever forgotten. The film
        of Mahine ROUHI convokes other times which inscribe the transition from
        one state (psychic, physical) to another. These changes occur at
        different speeds, on different emulsions according to various
        treatments. The plasticity that results is not the least quality of this
        film that revives the mythopoetic cinema. " Yann BEAUVAIS
