        >Ravi's lives his life by the pie-chart his mother defines for him - 60%
        education and only 0.2% - 2.9 minutes each day for fun! When Ravi and
        his friends, Hamid and Onka,chance upon the camera of a visiting
        tourist, they see their dreams come true where they can make a Bollywood
        film and meet the famous actress, Ms.Ray. The path to making a film is
        riddled with problems: they only have 7 days to return the camera and
        their final exams begin in 7 days! The 7 days mark a comical journey
        where Ravi sets out to make a Bollywood film with his schoolmates,
        writes a ransom note, casts a heroine in his film, uses creative ways to
        keep his friends, Hamid and Onka involved in his project during the
        ever-stressful exam season and keeps his mother thinking that all his
        hard work was towards his final exams!</image:caption
