        >Michel is a Belgian inventor. He cares for his father, a paralysed
        writer, is married to a Congolese woman and is the father of an
        interracial child whom he reassures as to his parentage. He discovers at
        the age of 41 that he was adopted, actually having been born in
        Sainte-CÃ©cile, Quebec. In the summer of 2000, he travels to Quebec,
        supposedly to sell some of his inventions. While on a near-impossible
        quest to find his birth family in the town where he was born, he crosses
        paths with Louis Legros, son of another inventor, in a meeting which
        will change their lives.</image:caption
