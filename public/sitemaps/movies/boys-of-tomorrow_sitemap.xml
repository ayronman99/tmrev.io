        >Earning a living as a driver for rent, Kisu lives in a studio flat in
        the basement floor. When he feels choked up, he tries not to let go of
        hope by playing on the drums. Out of guilt that he might have made
        Jongdae sexually handicapped during their younger days, Kisu took on a
        role as Jongdae's guardian on top of being his friend. Jongdae's dream
        is to keep a revolver that can make him stronger than the small-time
        gangsters around town. One day Kisu's older brother shows up and leave
        behind his son Yohan to Kisu's care.</image:caption
