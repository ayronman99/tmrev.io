        >In this one-hour documentary film, Demi will let the MTV audience
        inside to witness their most private moments, during their very public
        recovery from their eating disorder. With MTV's cameras following,
        they'll return for the very first time to the treatment facility they
        retreated to back in November 2010 to speak candidly to their recovering
        peers about their experiences, and to thank the counselors and staff who
        they say kept them alive. They'll also let the MTV audience witness
        first-hand their on-going evolution as an artist - as they ditch their
        bubble-gum Disney past and tries on a new persona as confessional
        singer-songwriter, and perform an album full of deeply personal material
        in-front of sold-out crowds for the first time.</image:caption
