        >Joe Slaader is a mysterious mountain man being held in the Ulster
        County Asylum after the brutal murder of his family. Edward Eischel, a
        young intern, sees something more than just an inbred monster in this
        new inmate, however. Instead, he sees him as the harbinger of some
        greater and much darker force. With bodies piling up, his job in
        jeopardy, and his sanity hanging in the balance he gives in to his
        obsession with tapping into Joe's hidden power, risking all that he has
        along the way.</image:caption
