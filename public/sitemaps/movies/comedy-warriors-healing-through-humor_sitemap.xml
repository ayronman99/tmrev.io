        >In this documentary five severely wounded Iraq/Afghanistan veterans
        work with professional comedy writers and A-List comedians Lewis Black,
        Zach Galifianakis, BJ Novak, and Bob Saget to explore their personal
        experiences through the healing power of humor. Writing their own
        stand-up comedy routines they find new perspectives from which to view
        their injuries and their lives - all of which culminates in a
        performance at two of LA's top comedy clubs.</image:caption
