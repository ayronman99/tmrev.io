        >Numerous filmmakers and video artists have attempted, with varying
        success, to produce visual representations of memories. The eye of
        memory does not see things in the same way as the physical eye, and many
        artists have come to regret this difference. Aravena Abughosh's attempt
        belongs to the category of successes. He has managed to account for the
        fragmentary and associative character of memory; for the vague emerging
        and dissolving of images, and even for the feelings that are so
        intrinsically linked to it.</image:caption
