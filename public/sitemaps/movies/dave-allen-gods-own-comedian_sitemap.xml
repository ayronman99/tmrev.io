        >Told by family and friends, with rare unseen archive, this documentary
        reflects on the career of Dave Allen, relative of poet Katharine Tynan,
        and a natural performer who cut his teeth at Butlins. He became a TV
        star in Australia in his twenties, before returning home to dominate the
        schedules here in Britain with his unique blend of sketches and stories
        in a career that took in films, plays, documentaries and chat shows,
        alongside award winning comedy series.</image:caption
