        >The only solo artist in country music history to have his first four
        singles reach number one (the duo Brooks & Dunn also did it), Clint
        Black stars in ten of his biggest hit videos in this amazing package.
        Not only a great visual portrait of this country music icon, but a
        masterful career retrospective, this set offers a fine chronological
        summary of Clint's life on the charts. From his groundbreaking 1989 hit,
        A Better Man, through 1997's masterful Something That We Do, Clint's
        growth as a performer and a songwriter is mirrored in his choice of
        homey backdrops and colorful characters.</image:caption
