        >Brad Pitt is a singular actor in Hollywood's glamorous world, breaking
        through his "playboy image" and embodying American cinema's renewal. At
        the beginning there was a humble Midwestern aware of being a smokescreen
        for the illusions of his time, who has managed to keep control of his
        image to better serve the most talented directors of our time. To name
        but a few: David Fincher, Quentin Tarantino, the Coen brothers, Terrence
        Malick, James Gray and soon Damien Chazelle. This documentary dives into
        the brain of a complex, brilliant and endearing personality, far from
        the clich√© of a world-famous movie icon to discover the hidden side of
        the most handsome man in the world.</image:caption
