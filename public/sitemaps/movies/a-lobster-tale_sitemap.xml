        >Cody Brewer, a quiet New England fisherman isn't doing too well for
        himself. His wife feels neglected, and his son keeps getting picked on
        by the school bully. While out collecting his lobster traps one day,
        Cody finds a strange green moss that holds magical powers. Once word
        gets out about the magical moss, the entire town suddenly becomes Cody's
        best friend, all hoping to get a piece of it. With the townspeople
        clamoring for some moss and the already delicate state of the Brewer
        family, Cody has a tough time figuring out exactly what to
        do.</image:caption
