        >When a boy is too confused to speak with his non-communicative family,
        words eventually lose their meaning. He decides to communicate with his
        dandruff and a cup of cold coffee instead. His father ignores these
        eccentricities, assuming it is just a ploy to get attention. Meanwhile,
        the boy's sister likes exercising seductively in front of men and is
        better able to capture her father's attention than her brother. Their
        mother is oblivious, perpetually talking to people on her mobile phone
        and the space the family occupies grows narrower and
        narrower.</image:caption
