        >The little known story of one of the worst non-combat disasters in the
        history of the US Navy, …AS IF THEY WERE ANGELS is a story of courage,
        heart, sacrifice and the heroism of miners & fishermen of 2 small towns,
        who risked their lives to save nearly 200 American sailors, shipwrecked
        on the rugged cliffs of Newfoundland. Narrated by Peter Coyote, it’s a
        deeply layered tale of navigation errors, courts martial mistakes, a
        steep loss of life, and resonates today as if the very telling of its
        deep humanity offers a lifeline for our fractured times.</image:caption
