        >Just before Christmas, bestselling author Rachel Kennedy returns to her
        hometown to host an event for her upcoming book. Though being home is
        difficult since losing her parents and losing touch with her brother,
        David, she finds strength from unexpected sources, namely her local
        producer, Jack and a selfless stranger, Joy. Jack and Joy help Rachel
        connect with the community, reunite with her brother and reevaluate her
        motivational message. Rachel and Jack develop an undeniable bond, but
        Rachel is torn between their relationship and career pressure from her
        manager, Stuart. As the event approaches, Joy reveals a secret from her
        past that has a lasting impact on Jack, and Rachel must find a message
        that brings her fans — and herself – lasting joy.</image:caption
