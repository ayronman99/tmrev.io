        >Anime Talk Show (also known as Adult Swim Brain Trust) is an animated
        television special that aired on Cartoon Network's late night
        programming block, Adult Swim, on November 4, 2004. Anime Talk Show
        revolved around the unofficial pilot for Squidbillies, however many
        people consider it the very last episode of Space Ghost, as it follows
        exactly the same format of the show, with Space Ghost interviewing
        guests. The short was dubbed "Anime Talk Show" due to it following the
        premiere of Perfect Hair Forever, which aired in place of what was
        supposed to have been the premiere of Squidbillies.</image:caption
