        >Bulle lives in the same apartment building as Tona, but is different
        from the others at school. He just doesn't fit in. The rules are strict
        as to what is cool and what is not, and make little room for variation
        or individuality. At least that is what Tona believes. After a while she
        feels that she has to drop Bulle as a friend in order to be accepted by
        the in-group. When forced to take sides she betrays Bulle. This is a
        film about how difficult things can be when you want to be liked, but
        don't have the strength of character to say what you mean. Written by
