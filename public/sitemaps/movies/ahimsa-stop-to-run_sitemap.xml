        >Ahimsa is a young man who's haunted by his karma, which takes the form
        of a mysterious red-haired man who dishes out abuse when Ahimsa runs
        afoul of morality. When Ahimsa was a young boy, a shaman had the
        mysterious man removed, but the man returns when Ahimsa is a young man
        and starts taking drugs and getting involved in rave culture. Ahimsa's
        behavior soon causes trouble for his friends, Ukhoht and Einstein, and a
        female physician, Dr. Pattaya. The film was Thailand's official entry to
        the 79th Academy Awards. It was chosen after Pen-Ek Ratanaruang's
        "Invisible Waves" had been withdrawn by the Federation of National Film
        Associations of Thailand.</image:caption
