        >Matsuoi and his wife Tsuya moved to Oshima City because of her
        unpredictable character. Even though Tsuya continues to have affairs,
        Matsuoi loves her and is a devoted husband. Tsuya is then diagnosed with
        a cancer and later goes into a coma. Matsuoi then thinks of his wife's
        lovers. Matsui goes to those men and informs them of Tatsuya's
