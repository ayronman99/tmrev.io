        >A movie about the power of thousands, the courage of hundreds and
        friendship of a few, thanks to whom a change of fate of millions became
        possible. Poland, lower Silesia, the beginning of a very cold winter
        1981. After a series of entrapments by the security service a
        confrontation between the opposition and the communists seems to be
        inevitable. Just before the proclamation of martial law a group of young
        solidarity activists decide to play va banque and organize a rash action
        to take out 80 million of the union money from one of the Wroclaw’s
        banks before the account is blocked. Security service officers follow
        their steps. It’s the beginning of a gripping tournament in which also
        priests and curb dealers will play their parts. Each side has aces up
        their sleeve.</image:caption
