        >In his quest to become successful, Aditya Parikh puts life on the back
        burner, including his Father Bipin Chandra Parikh. Infuriated and
        heartbroken, the father persuades his monotonous son to take an
        unplanned journey of a lifetime for a much needed appreciation that life
        deserves. Their trip to bliss soon turns into a nightmare when they meet
        a backpacker named Ketki Mehta. An enigma in her own way, she takes the
        father-son duo on a voyage that turns out to be more than they bargained
        for. The escapade turns out to be an experience as more surprises and
        realizations wait their way to happiness, opening new doorways to the
        meaning of life. Directed by Vipul Mehta, Produced by Rashmin Majithia
        and soulful Music by Sachin-Jigar, Chaal Jeevi Laiye is a film that's
        all about living life to the fullest.</image:caption
