        >Tina and Lea are best friends who are also avid fans of Vilma Santos.
        They were inseparable until Lea decides to leave the country and go to
        Korea. They promise that someday they will really become one big happy
        family when their children get married. Years after, by virtue of an old
        vow, Lucky Girl and Lucky Boy are forced to be together by their
        mothers. Problem is, they hate each other's guts. But, just when they're
        falling for each other, love plays a trick on the meddling moms which
        threatens to bring the young lovers apart.</image:caption
