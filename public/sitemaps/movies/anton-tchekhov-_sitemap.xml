        >Summer 1890. In order to make some money to feed his family, Anton
        Chekhov, modest physician, wrote short stories for newspapers to sign
        Antosha Tchékhonté. Important characters, writer and editor, just make
        him aware of his talent. His situation is improving and Anton Chekhov
        gets the Pushkin prices and admiration of Tolstoy. But when one of his
        brothers died of tuberculosis, Anton saw it as a personal failure and
        wants to escape his fame and his love.</image:caption
