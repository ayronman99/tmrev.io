        >In 2001, one of the worlds most accomplished climbers and adventurers,
        Jon Muir began a 2,500 kilometre odyssey to cross Australia from the
        south to the north coast on foot. For 128 days, Jon and his dog
        Seraphine, survived entirely off the land -- hunting and gathering along
        the way. Jon was taxed to the limit physically and emotionally. Often
        close to despair, he drew on his instinct for survival, his deep
        understanding of the land and his remarkable inner
        strength.</image:caption
