        >A story of two boys caught up in the turmoil of the dramatic events of
        1956 in Central Europe. At 13, Romek Strzalkowski was the youngest
        victim of the first workers' rebellion against Communist authorities in
        Poland. During "Black Thursday" on June 26, he was killed protesting
        near the UB political police headquarters. Peter Mansfeld was the
        youngest victim of post-revolt Communist reprisals in Hungary. As a
        15-year-old he took part in the Budapest fighting. After the revolution
        had been quelled by the Soviet army in 1956, he did not give up; he was
        arrested in 1959 and sentenced to death. Because of the Communists'
        cruelty, it took as long as 13 minutes for Peter to die, "like Jesus
        Christ on the cross," said his Hungarian biographer. The filmmakers
        analyze the importance of the legend about the two boys who fought
        against Communism in Poland and Hungary.</image:caption
