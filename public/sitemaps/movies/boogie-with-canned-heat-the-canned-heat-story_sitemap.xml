        >A profile of one of the most commercially successful white blues bands
        of the 1960s. Fronted by the man-mountain that was Bob Hite, they
        enjoyed international success with hits such as 'On the Road Again' and
        'Going Up the Country'. The story of their rise to fame is told here by
