        >In southwestern China, state athletic coaches scour the countryside to
        recruit poor, rural teenagers who demonstrate a natural ability to throw
        a good punch. Moved into boxing training centers, these boys and girls
        undergo a rigorous regimen that grooms them to be China’s next Olympic
        heroes but also prepares them for life outside the ring. As these young
        boxers develop, the allure of turning professional for personal gain and
        glory competes with the main philosophy behind their training – to
        represent their country. Interconnected with their story is that of
        their charismatic coach, Qi Moxiang, who – now in his late thirties and
        determined to win back lost honor – trains for a significant
        fight.</image:caption
