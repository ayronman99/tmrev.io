        >Arjun (Shiv Pandit) come to Mumbai to visit his fiancee Maya. He
        reaches the City court to meet her and is taken aback when he is not
        able to find her anywhere. He begins to search for Maya and in an
        unexpected turn witnesses an unlikely murder. Frantic and exasperated,
        he is left with no choice but take passerby's as hostages before he is
        framed as the killer. The cops try to tackle the situation and within no
        time realize that Arjun is no ordinary hostage-taker and it seems next
        to impossible to apprehend him. Now, with nothing to lose, Arjun lays
        down his terms: "I have 7 hostages! And I am giving the Police 7 hours
        to find out the killer...! I need progress every 60 minutes or one
        hostage dies every hour!!" The clock ticks and the investigation
        begins.</image:caption
