        >The film takes place in Paris, where two cops are competing for the
        vacant seat of chief of police while in the middle of a search for a
        gang of violent thieves. The movie is directed by Olivier Marchal, a
        former police officer who spent 12 years with the French police before
        creating this story, which is taken in part from real facts that
        happened during the 1980s in France.</image:caption
