        >Christo Roppolo claims to have been videotaping and communicating with
        UFOs around Monterey, CA for several years. He contacted filmmaker,
        Justin Gaar, in 2013 to begin creating a film about his sightings.
        Skeptical of the footage but intrigued by Christo's eccentricities and
        wild stories, Justin begins spending time with Christo hunting UFOs
        along California's beautiful central coast. When a crop circle appears
        in Monterey County and becomes international news, Christo is validated
        in his belief of alien contact and Justin, shocked, begins investigating
        the source of the crop circle and how Christo knows beyond a doubt that
        he's being contacted by his "brother's from space."</image:caption
