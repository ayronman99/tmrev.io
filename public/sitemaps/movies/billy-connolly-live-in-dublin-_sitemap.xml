        >Billy Connolly: Live in Dublin 2002 presents highlights from the Big
        Yin's 2002 stage tour. The program is divided in two, the first part
        offering an hour from his Dublin show, the second delivering 45 minutes
        of highlights from eight other performances. Now 60, age has not
        withered Connolly--even if, as he is fond of reminding us, his pubic
        hair has turned grey--and his restless energy, enthusiasm, casual
        obscenity, and anger is as intense as ever. And, of course, very, very
        funny. Whether talking about the horrors of a prostate examination or
        reminiscing about his youth, Connolly has the audience in
        hysterics.</image:caption
