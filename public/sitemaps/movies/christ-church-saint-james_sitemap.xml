        >In the spring of 1998, Christ Church - Saint James, an historic black
        church in Toronto's Little Italy, was destroyed by arson. All that
        remained were walls and a pit, and over subsequent years, the site was
        overtaken with graffiti. This film has taken on the layered form of the
        site itself: the space and its surfaces becoming tangled and multiple,
        the grid of a stone-filled window giving geometric form to
        simultaneously occurring images of concrete, nature, waste, paint, and
        sky.</image:caption
