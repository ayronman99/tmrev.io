        >Birth Story: Ina May Gaskin and The Farm Midwives captures a spirited
        group of women who taught themselves how to deliver babies on a 1970s
        hippie commune. Today as nearly one third of all US babies are born via
        C-section, they fight to protect their knowledge and to promote
        respectful, safe maternity practices all over the globe. From the backs
        of their technicolor school buses, these pioneers rescued American
        midwifery from extinction, changed the way a generation approached
        pregnancy, and filmed nearly everything they did. With unprecedented
        access to the midwives' archival video collection, as well as modern day
        footage of life at the alternative intentional community where they
        live, this documentary shows childbirth the way most people have never
        seen it--unadorned, unabashed, and awe-inspiring.</image:caption
