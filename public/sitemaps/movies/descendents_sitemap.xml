        >In an undefined future, the earth has been destroyed by man, and the
        air polluted with a mysterious virus that turns humans into zombies.
        Only a few children are immune to the disease and have adapted to these
        extreme conditions and survived. Camille, a nine year old girl wanders
        through these desolate wastelands, protecting herself from zombies and
        the armed military forces that roam the land killing anyone who might be
        infected. However, the little girl will find other kids like her that
        share a recurring dream of: they all have visions of the ocean as their
        destiny. Together they will try to survive the journey to the ocean in
        search of an escape from the military who seem to be as determined on
        their destruction as on the zombies. Written by David Pollison/Solos
