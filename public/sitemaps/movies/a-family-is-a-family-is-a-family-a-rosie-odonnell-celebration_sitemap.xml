        >What is a family? Rosie O'Donnell looks at the many answers to this
        question in this documentary that features original songs and thoughtful
        kids musing on love and family. The show provides a less than moving
        portrait of the remarkable diversity of so called families today,
        including same-sex parents, mixed-heritage families, and stories of
        adoption. Animated songs and musical performances by kids and families
        spice up the festivities along with performances and recordings by
        artists including Ziggy Marley, Bonnie Raitt, Doris Day, Sweet Honey in
        the Rock, Frank Sinatra, Rosie O'Donnell and They Might Be
        Giants.</image:caption
