        >The story of D-Day has been told from the point of view of the soldiers
        who fought in it, the tacticians who planned it and the generals who led
        it. But that epic event in world history has never been told before
        through the perspective of the strange handful of spies who made it
        possible. D-Day was a great victory of arms, a tactical coup, and a
        moral crusade. But it was also a triumph for espionage, deceit, and
        thinking of the most twisted sort. Following on from his hugely
        successful BBC Two documentaries, Operation Mincemeat and Double Agent:
        The Eddie Chapman Story (Agent Zigzag), writer and presenter Ben
        Macintyre returns to the small screen to bring to life his third
        best-selling book - Double Cross The True Story of the D-Day Spies.
        Macintyre reveals the gripping true story of five of the double agents
        who helped to make D-day such a success.</image:caption
