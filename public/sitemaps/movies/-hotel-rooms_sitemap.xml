        >While traveling for work in a city far from their homes, a novelist and
        a corporate accountant find themselves in bed together. Although she’s
        married, and he’s seeing someone, their intense attraction turns a
        one-night stand into an unexpected relationship and a respite from the
        obligations of daily life. Through a series of moments – some profound,
        some silly, some intensely intimate – we see a portrait of an evolving
        relationship that could become the most significant one of their
        lives.</image:caption
