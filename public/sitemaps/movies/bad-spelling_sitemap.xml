        >At a French boarding school for troubled youth in the early 1970's, the
        Headmaster and his wife decide that their son Daniel, who is fifteen
        years old but looks younger, should finally go live in the dorm with all
        the other students, as they do not want it to seem Daniel is receiving
        any special treatment. Daniel is now faced with the challenge of earning
        the trust and respect of the other students, who all come from troubled
        backgrounds.</image:caption
