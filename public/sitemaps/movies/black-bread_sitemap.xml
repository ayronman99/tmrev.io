        >In the harsh post-war years' Catalan countryside, Andreu, a child that
        belongs to the losing side, finds the corpses of a man and his son in
        the forest. The authorities want his father to be made responsible of
        the deaths, but Andreu tries to help his father by finding out who truly
        killed them. In this search, Andreu develops a moral consciousness
        against a world of adults fed by lies. In order to survive, he betrays
        his own roots and ends up finding out the monster that lives within
        him.</image:caption
