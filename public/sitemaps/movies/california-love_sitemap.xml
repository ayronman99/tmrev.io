        >Leon Watkins runs a community helpline in South Central LA, where
        anyone in need of help is welcome. One of his most frequent visitors is
        local gang leader, John Wesley Hunter, otherwise known as “Joker” to the
        streets. After a day of hustling and almost losing his life in a
        shoot-out, Joker goes to the one place where he knows he can get help.
        All in a typical day’s work for Leon until an unlikely woman shows up
        insisting on aiding him in his fight for his community. This unlikely
        team defies social constructs by working together to actively fight
        oppression and gain nation-wide recognition for a hidden reality of
        many. Along their way they experience the deep-seeded hatred that has
        plagued America, great love, and tragedy as they leave behind a
        legacy.</image:caption
