        >For the last 10 years, Q-dance has been entertaining fans from the
        harder styles in dance music with high quality productions. Some parties
        have fared better than others; some have been held indoors, some
        outdoors, sometimes smaller, and most of them have been really big with
        all of them incorporating a wonderful atmosphere. With over 300 parties
        and more than 1.5 million participants, we have aptly, named our 10-year
        anniversary: ‘’de Q-dance Feestfabriek - the Q-dance Party Factory’’.
        For the first time in 10 years, we give the visitor a glance into our
        party-kitchen and this year we are cooking up a storm!</image:caption
