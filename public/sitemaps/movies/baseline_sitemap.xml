        >The Baseline is the centre of the East London grime club scene and the
        queue regularly stretches around the block. Danny works on the door -
        breaking up fights and managing drunk kids. However, when he rescues
        Terry, the club owner and local gang leader, from a hitman, Danny is
        suddenly plunged deep into an underworld he had tried so hard to avoid.
        Danny is promoted to manager, but only on the condition that he turns a
        blind eye to the shady goings on both on and off the dance-floor. Danny
        and his girlfriend Jessica dream of setting up their own club, but Danny
        is forced to make the ultimate sacrifice when he has to choose between
        loyalty, morality and his own dreams of escape</image:caption
