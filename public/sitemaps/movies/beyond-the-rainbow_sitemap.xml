        >Homosexuality is one of the biggest taboos in Kosovar society. So much
        that the main characters of this film are hidden in shadows to protect
        them from the frequent attacks that occur against gays in Kosovo. This
        film gives the platform for Kosovo’s homosexual community to speak about
        their experiences and the discrimination against them, while shedding
        light on the subject through interviews with Kosovo’s religious leaders,
        psychologists, analysts and other citizens. Will society learn to accept
        these people as part of Kosovo’s new liberal reality, or must
        homosexuals remain in the shadows, hiding their true sexual identities
        in fear?</image:caption
