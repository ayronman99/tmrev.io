        >A new film compiled from the BFI National Archive's unparalleled
        holdings of early films of China, features films from 1900-48 filmed
        across China. The cinematic journey of Around China with a Movie Camera
        contains many films which may never have been seen in China, or at the
        very least not for over 70 years. These travelogues, newsreels and home
        movies were made by a diverse group of British and French filmmakers,
        some professionals, but mainly enthusiastic amateurs, including intrepid
        tourists, colonial-era expatriates and Christian
        missionaries.</image:caption
