        >Daniel Tammet has autism. He is also a savant. He can perform
        mind-boggling mathematical calculations at breakneck speeds. But unlike
        other savants, who can perform similar feats, Tammet can describe how he
        does it. He speaks seven languages and is even devising his own
        language. Now scientists are asking whether his exceptional abilities
        are the key to unlock the secrets of autism. This documentary follows
        Daniel as he travels to America to meet the scientists who are convinced
        he may hold the key to unlocking similar abilities in everyone. He is
        challenged to learn Icelandic, one of the worldâ€™s hardest languages, in
        just one week. Will Daniel do it? And what can we learn from this
        prodigious talent?</image:caption
