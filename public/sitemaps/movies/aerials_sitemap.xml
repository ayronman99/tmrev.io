        >Earth is invaded by Aliens from outer space. An intermarried couple
        living in the city of Dubai are confined to their home due to the
        uncertainty of the situation. Disconnected from the world outside due to
        the loss of communication, they explore around their cultural
        differences in Science in order to understand the reason behind Aliens
        coming to our planet; only to find themselves caught between a series of
        extraterrestrial encounters at their very home.</image:caption
