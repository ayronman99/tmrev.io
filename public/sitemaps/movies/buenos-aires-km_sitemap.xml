        >A remote village 100 kilometers from the city of Buenos Aires. Stephen,
        Matías, Alejo, Damián and Guido were born 13 years ago in this small
        town. Have always been friends and together they share the monotonous
        summer afternoons sitting on the stoop of a women's hairdresser.
        Anxious, restless, impatient for a change, go through the most confusing
        period of experiment. The transition from childhood to adolescence.
        Appears curious about women and sexual awakening, accompanied by the
        rebellion against their parents and family mandates.</image:caption
