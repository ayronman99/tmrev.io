        >A professor of German literature, Su Young is quiet, modest, and
        unassuming, but behind his averted eyes lies an unforgettable story. At
        his students' urging, he recalls his surreal first love during the
        turbulent 1980s. As a college student, Su Young falls in love with
        spunky wild child Pippi Langstrump, only to see her commit suicide in
        front of his eyes. Strangely enough, she mysteriously reappears soon
        after. Adding to his confusion, Su Young finds himself increasingly
        drawn to and frightened by Su Ji, a quirky high school girl that he is
        tutoring.</image:caption
