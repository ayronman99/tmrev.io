        >Helba has prepared a special hot springs for the .hack characters so
        they could get some rest and relaxation. Kite, Elk, Tsukasa, Mimiru and
        many other characters from the series make an appearence in The World
        for this reward. There is only one small catch, Helba will not reveal
        the exact location of where the springs are located. It soon becomes a
        race between the cast of .hack//SIGN and the characters from the game to
        see who can find it first. However, this is a catch, while everyone is
        trying to find the springs, someone is going around killing the other
        charcaters. Who will make it to the springs first and who is behind the
        deaths of many of the other characters?</image:caption
