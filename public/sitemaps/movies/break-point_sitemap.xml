        >Jimmy Price is a reckless man-child on the last leg of his career as a
        doubles tennis player. When his latest partner drops him, he realizes
        he's officially burned all of his bridges on the pro circuit. He decides
        to make one last ditch effort to revive his career, reaching outside of
        the tennis world and convincing his childhood partner -- his estranged
        brother Darren, now an apathetic substitute teacher - to team up with
        him. The mismatched pair, with the help of a unique 11-year-old named
        Barry, make an unlikely run at a grand slam tournament and are forced to
        re-discover their game, and their brotherhood.</image:caption
