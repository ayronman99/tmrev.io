        >Two millennia ago, a Lybian king has a basilisk (snake-shaped dragon),
        which petrifies people, subjected to the same fate with a golden scepter
        during a solar eclipse. Both these and several victims are dug up by
        modern archaeologist Harrison 'Harry' McColl's expedition. Despite a
        cryptic warning from tribal locals, everything goes to his Colorado
        university's museum. It's all exhibited during another eclipse, which
        leads to the monster reviving. Harry and some of his friends must try to
        petrify the monster again.</image:caption
