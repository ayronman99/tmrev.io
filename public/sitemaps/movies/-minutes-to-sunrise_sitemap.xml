        >They say the darkest hour is just before dawn, and at the Sunrise diner
        it's very late indeed. Four couples find themselves at an out-of-the-way
        24-hour diner, but they are not all that they seem. Intertwined
        throughout the night are a middle age couple who are at a crisis in
        their lives, a cook who thinks he is finally finding his way forward, a
        waitress in a bad relationship and a young punk and his girlfriend who
        think this is the last stop before the new world of imagined ease. But
        the strangest of all are the dark stranger and young girl who don't seem
        to be part of this world. A film about dreams gone bad, missed
        opportunities, love, fear and death.</image:caption
