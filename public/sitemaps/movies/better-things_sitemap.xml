        >Gails agoraphobia keeps her inside where she escapes into romance
        novels. She shares a house with her Nan, recently back from the
        hospital. Gradually, they both try to reach out to each other to break
        their isolation. Rob plunges further into his addiction as a way of
        numbing his heartbreak over the death of his girlfriend. In his stupor,
        he dreams of embracing her again. Mr &amp; Mrs Gladwin are going through
        a shift in their 60 year relationship. Years of resentment and unspoken
        truths have built a barrier between them that Mrs Gladwin, in her
        abiding love, tries to erode in little gestures.</image:caption
