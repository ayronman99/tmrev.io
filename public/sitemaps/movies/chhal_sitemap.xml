        >Secret Service Agent, Karan Menon (Kay Kay) has been assigned the task
        of penetrating the gang and winning the confidence of underworld don,
        Shastri (Vallabh Vyas). Karan does so with ease, however, problems arise
        when he falls for Shastri's deputy's Girish (Prashant Narayan) sister,
        Padmini (Jaya Seal). He then starts to sympathize with Shastri and
        Girish and attempts to convince his Department, in vain. His Department
        assumes that he is now a out of control rogue agent, and he stops
        getting any support from them. And at the same time he must face the
        wrath of Shastri and Girish when they find out that they have been
        harboring a policeman in their midst.</image:caption
