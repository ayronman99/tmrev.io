        >Davy is a 28-year-old writer on a road trip to promote his unpublished
        collection of short stories. A random phone call in Davy's motel room
        from a mysterious, sexy woman named Nicole leads to a series of phone
        sex sessions that surprisingly over time become emotionally and sexually
        satisfying for the shy writer. Later, when he meets a former girlfriend,
        he must try to choose between them - but only if he can arrange a
        meeting with his reclusive phone mate.</image:caption
