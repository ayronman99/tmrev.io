        >WHAT if the president of the United States is not constitutionally
        eligible to serve? Is it possible that a straightforward criterion was
        overlooked during a long, grueling, expensive campaign? Why are so many
        questions about something so simple still going unanswered? "A Question
        Of Eligibility" goes where no other documentary has dared to go in
        seeking the answers to those questions, including one that millions of
        Americans are asking: "Why won't Barack Obama release publicly the
        long-form birth certificate he claims to have from the state of
        Hawaii?"</image:caption
