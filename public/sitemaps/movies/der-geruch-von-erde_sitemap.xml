        >While Dr. Ellen Bischoff celebrates success in her career, her family
        life is not at its best. Once she quarreled with her father Anton and
        turned her back on the local dairy farm. But now Anton is in the
        hospital after a severe heart attack. Ellen returns home to keep the
        operation going. There she meets her childhood sweetheart Felix again,
        whom she never forgave that he cheated on her with her former best
        friend Karin. In addition, Ellen struggles with serious problems: The
        father's farm is highly indebted and should be auctioned. The situation
        seems hopeless.</image:caption
