        >Eava Eliana (Nora Danish) is a director in one of the company that her
        father Tan Sri Zaini (Zaibo) owns. As a single child, she is pampered
        since childhood. Upon returning from studying abroad, she starts to work
        in her father’s company. Tan Sri Zaini’s close friend Datuk Hamzah plans
        to marry Eava with his playboy son Remy (Zed Zaidi) in order to control
        Tan Sri Zaini’s wealth. Things turn awry as Eava catches Remy kissing
        another woman, which forces Eava to leave town abruptly. Upon reaching
        her hotel, she meets Omar Rudy (Farid Kamil), a hotel staff who
        accommodates her complaints, even being her tour guide at a small town.
        Things take a turn for the worse when a typhoon hit the sea, forcing
        Omar and Eava to camp in a secluded island in the middle of the
        ocean.</image:caption
