        >Four small-town boys are kidnapped by James Whitley, a warm-eyed
        psychopath. His grotesque pursuit to reunite orphaned children with
        their deceased birth parents is halted when the boys escape and he is
        arrested. Fifteen years later Whitley flees during a prison fire and
        decides to see his mission through. Detective Larson, once Whitley's
        prior victim, is removed from the case due to impartiality leaving his
        partner, and lover, Detective Shotwell to solve the case. Fueled by rage
        and a chance of redemption, Detective Larson chases the steadfast
        psychopath on his own only to fall back into the same trap he once
        escaped as a child.</image:caption
