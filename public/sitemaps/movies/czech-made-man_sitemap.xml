        >The movie is based on the narrative of a Czech multimillionaire who
        achieved success not by stripping companies, making crooked deals and
        crony-ism, but by blazing his own trail like Schweikesque self-made man.
        He realizes early on that he has nobody but himself to rely on. During
        the totalitarian regime of the 80s, he ambles along his oddball path and
        then experiences the Velvet Revolution atypically, too - in an asylum
        amidst nut-cases. After the Revolution, he really gets rolling. To
        Germany and back. To prison and back. To China and back. The intriguing
        and endless opportunities afforded by the Internet eventually blossom
        into virtual prosperity. The hero has everything and is even planning a
        highly unorthodox family. A happy ending is nigh, until everything goes
        up in smoke, of course...</image:caption
