        >Magazine editor Taishin Mamiya interviews high school model Noeru
        Kisaragi. Despite Noeru's bad attitude, his painting of an ocean
        intrigues Mamiya and leads to a dinner, during which Noeru solicits
        Mamiya sexually. Soon Mamiya sees Noeru with another man, and he is
        shocked to discover at that moment that his interest in Noeru goes
        beyond article researchâ€”he truly wants to know more about
        him.</image:caption
