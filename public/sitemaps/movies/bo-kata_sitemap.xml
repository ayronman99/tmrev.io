        >Bo Kata, loosely translated in English means hacked! That is the
        victory battle cry when kites are eliminated in raging sky duels,
        sometimes lasting hours. Filmed entirely in Lahore, Pakistan, over three
        continuous days, Bo Kata is a rare cinematic documentary treat,
        depicting uniquely the rooftop kite flyers of Lahore, who have been a
        traditional part of Pakistan's culture and heritage that has lasted for
        over 400 years. Their sport is now under threat from a complete ban,
        after a series of tragic fatalities involving children and
        motorcyclists, resulting in decapitations and dismemberment from illegal
        chemically coated strings used to fly the kites. The documentary
        highlights a population that is associated with the mysterious art of
        kite dueling amidst the political backdrop of an impending
        ban</image:caption
