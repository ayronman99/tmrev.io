        >After the death of uncle Olivier, his estate, a small chateau in
        Provence and the small town's only undertaker firm in its cellar, befall
        equally and jointly to his local stepson André Vidal, who runs the
        business since Olivier semi-retired ill, and German cousin, business
        consultant Charlotte. She arrives from Frankfort to sell the estate at
        the skyrocketing prices for such idyllic hospitality industry sites.
        André is shocked, determined to preserve the town's social fabric by
        preserving Olivier's heritage, and disappointed she doesn't even
        recognize him as childhood best playmate. It turns out the backward
        taxes are a ticking bomb, which she sneakily intends to ignite, only
        André's charms and the lavender-scented bucolic way of life appeal ever
        more even to businesslike Charlotte.</image:caption
