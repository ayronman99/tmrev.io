        >"Dolly Parton's Coat of Many Colors" is based on the inspiring true
        story of living legend Dolly Parton's remarkable upbringing. This
        once-in-a-lifetime movie special takes place inside the tight-knit
        Parton family as they struggle to overcome devastating tragedy and
        discover the healing power of love, faith and a raggedy patchwork coat
        that helped make Parton who she is today. The film is set in the
        Tennessee Great Smoky Mountains in 1955. It is neither a biopic nor a
        musical about Dolly's whole life and performing career, but rather a
        family-oriented faith-based story about the incidents in her and her
        family's life around the time she was nine years old.</image:caption
