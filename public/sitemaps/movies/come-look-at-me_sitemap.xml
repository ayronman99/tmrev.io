        >The movie is about an old disabled lady who lives with her spinster
        daughter. The lady desperately wants her daughter to marry, and the
        daughter, driven by the supposed imminent death of her mother, invites a
        total stranger home and introduces him as her boyfriend. The man and the
        prospective mother-in-law eventually start to like each other, and he
        makes every effort to be liked by the daughter. With the intervention of
        a fantasy granddaughter, quasi-miraculous healing, and a lot of
        hilarious repartee in between, the movie has a happy
        ending.</image:caption
