        >Hyuk-soo's wife passed away 10 years ago and now he lives in a fishing
        village when his friend's daughter Se-hee comes to visit him. His boring
        life has just become exciting thanks to Se-hee. Her ex-boyfriend
        Jong-jin comes to see her, but he only wants his bank book back. She
        uses Hyuk-soo to make him jealous, and the two fall for each
        other.</image:caption
