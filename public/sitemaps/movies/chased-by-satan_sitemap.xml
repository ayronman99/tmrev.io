        >Three teen couples are making an amateur horror movie titled "Dikejar
        Setan", for an indie film festival. To capture audience attention, they
        want a real ghost in the scenes. So they hire a ghost whisperer in the
        film production. Slowly, reality and hallucination haunt them, blurring
        the boundaries between the past, and present. Then they are all
        implicated in a crime event that took place some time ago, that had many
        victims. The terror of "death" is now after them.</image:caption
