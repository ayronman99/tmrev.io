        >Following David Attenborough as he travels the globe to film his
        series, David Attenborough's First Life, in which he explores the very
        origins of life on Earth. David journeys to the parts of the world which
        have had special meaning to him during his 50 years of broadcasting.
        Beginning near his boyhood Leicestershire home, where he first collected
        fossils, he then travels to Morocco's arid deserts, the glaciers of
        Canada and crystal clear waters of Australia's Great Barrier Reef. As a
        prelude to the First Life series, Attenborough's Journey provides a
        unique insight into the mind and character of one of the world's most
        iconic broadcasters as he shares his passions for the natural world.
        Combining his global journey for First Life and archive material looking
        back at his illustrious career both as a programme maker and a
        controller of the BBC, the film reveals what makes him
        tick.</image:caption
