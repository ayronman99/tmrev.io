        >Six people in New York are adrift. Zeke and Luke work in a sex shop:
        Zeke takes gay liberation seriously, Luke likes to sparkle and takes
        nothing seriously. He's offended when Stephen calls him a gay clich√©,
        then, surprisingly, they find each other attractive and interesting.
        Stephen, it turns out, has a great apartment, trust fund, and artwork
        he's painted on his walls. Meanwhile, Peter, a neat-freak, and Derek,
        nice to everyone, move in together. Peter's compulsiveness threatens the
        relationship. Last, newly-engaged Marilyn, a recovering alcoholic stuck
        at step 2, can't stop obsessing about wedding details. Can these folks
        sort out civilization and its discontents?</image:caption
