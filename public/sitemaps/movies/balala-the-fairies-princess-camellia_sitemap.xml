        >In the kingdom of Boka Boka, lives Princess Camellia, who can speak to
        magical creatures. One day, she loses control of three such creatures,
        causing them to flee. She sets on a quest to find them and lands on
        Earth. Meanwhile, human sisters Maggie and Michelle are eager to see
        SNH48 live, but their fairy caretaker Shirley doesn't agree. They find
        Camellia, and together with her and fellow Princess Emma of Gemini, they
        set off to the magical creatures.</image:caption
