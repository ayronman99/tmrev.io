        >Decorated Vietnam hero, Frank Vega returns home only to get shunned by
        society leaving him without a job or his high school sweetheart. It's

        a local hero where he's suddenly celebrated once again. But his good
        fortune suddenly turns for the worse when his best friend is murdered
        and the police aren't doing anything about it.</image:caption
