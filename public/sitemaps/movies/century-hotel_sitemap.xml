        >David Weaver makes his feature debut with this omnibus film in which
        each tale is told during different points during the 20th century, but
        in the same hotel room -- room 720. The film opens during the swinging
        '20s when a beautiful young woman, married against her will to a brutish
        thug of a man, endures a tension-fraught honeymoon. During the
        Depression segment, a mail-order bride from China meets her husband for
        the first time. Following the end of WWII, a soldier returns home to
        meet his girlfriend and his best friend. During the paranoia of the
        1950s, a professor searches for his wife. During the 1980s, a lawyer has
        too much sex and debt, and during the dawn of the millennium, a woman
        comes to a newly refurbished room 720 to meet her Internet lover. Such
        acclaimed Canadian actors as Tom McCamus, Sandrine Holt, and Colm Feore
        star in this film, which was screened at the 2001 Toronto Film
        Festival.</image:caption
