        >Bucum Jackson (Cube) is a bounty hunter with a lot of attitude and no
        interest in taking on a partner. Working at Martinez Bail Bonds, Jackson
        has unorthodox methods of tracking down low-life criminals, but they
        work, and one day he hopes to become his own boss and open up his own
        private investigation firm. Reggie Wright (Epps) is a slippery con
        artist who is avoiding the law, and Jackson. During a cat and mouse
        chase, the two stumble on a multi-million dollar diamond heist. Hiding
        from Jackson, Wright finds himself in the thieves' getaway van and ends
        up having to escape from them after they discover their booty is fake,
        much to the displeasure of their ruthless boss (Flanagan). When Wright
        meets up with his girlfriend (Mendes), he discovers that his recently
        purchased lottery ticket is the sole winner of $60 million.
        Unfortunately, his wallet, which held the ticket, was left in the
        thieves' van, so he persuades Jackson to help him get it
        back.</image:caption
