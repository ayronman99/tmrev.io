        >Aalwar is a traditional priest. He is devoted to his mother and sister.
        But the villainous elements Lal, Vincent Asokan, kill the sister and
        mother. Aalwar, with revenge ringing in his mind, ends up as Shiva the
        killer, even while working as a ward boy in a hospital. Shiva is out to
        make a statement against the venal forces. He sees himself as some kind
        of avatar â€” in fact, he bumps off the baddies under the get-up's of Lord
        Rama and Lord Krishna. In climax, Shiva turns up as Lord Narasimha and
        bumps off the last villain by placing him on his thighs and ripping
        apart his bowels and chest with his sharp claws.</image:caption
