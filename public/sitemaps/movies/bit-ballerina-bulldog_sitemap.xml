        >Armed with nothing but paper and scissors Danish-Norwegian psaligrapher
        Karen Bit Vejle makes staggeringly intricate and detail works of art. In
        the documentary BIT - BALLERINA BULLDOG we follow her as she gets the
        greatest opportunity of her career - a joint exhibition with the world's
        leading psaligrapher professor Qiao in Beijing. Bit Vejle struggles with
        chronic fatigue syndrome and as the big exhibition is fast approaching,
        she still hasn't completed her major works. Like a ballerina she has to
        find inner strength and endurance - a bulldog mentality - to perform her
        graceful art.</image:caption
