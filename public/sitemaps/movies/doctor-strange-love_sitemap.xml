        >This documentary shows a Brigade of medicine students that goes to a
        school to prevent AIDS. For 10 weeks, we follow their failures and
        achievements with a class of difficult but interesting characters. A
        film that asks us many questions about talking of sexuality and that is
        an important case study to the actual political debate on sexual
        education. The Brigades are voluntary groups of medicine students, who
        go to the schools to prevent risky behaviours and fight AIDS. Doctor
        Strange Love follows the action of a Brigade in the midst of a teenager
        class, focusing on value contrasts and relationships, through this
        experience of changing minds and consciousness.</image:caption
