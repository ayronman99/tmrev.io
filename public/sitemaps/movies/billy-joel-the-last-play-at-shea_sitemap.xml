        >In 1964, when the New York Mets were regarded as little more than a
        punch line in major league baseball, the team moved into a brand new
        ballpark, Shea Stadium, which was to become their home for the next
        forty-four years. Shea Stadium was closed (in part to create more
        parking space for a new stadium, Citi Field), and on July 16 and 18,
        2008, Billy Joel headlined the final concerts held at the stadium.
        Filmmaker Paul Crowder and a camera crew were on hand for Joel's shows,
        and the documentary THE LAST PLAY AT SHEA chronicles his historic
        two-night stand, as well as exploring Joel's career, his ties to
        working-class New York, and how his life and career paralleled the
        growth of suburban Long Island and the beloved ballpark.</image:caption
