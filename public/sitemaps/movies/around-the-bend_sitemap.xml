        >A tale of four generations of men, all of whom have had their offspring
        at a young age: a great-grandfather, a grandfather, a father in his
        twenties and a son who is about 7 years old. When the oldest member
        passes away, the trio heads out on the road together in the Southwest to
        search out an old family secret that connects to their
        past.</image:caption
