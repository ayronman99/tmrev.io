        experience with, someone vaguely resembling movie-songstress, Julie
        Andrews, who he's expecting at 7:30pm. His obsession with Ms. Andrews

        arrives however, he has to dispose of the body parts of Mr Azam, manager
        of his favourite Indian restaurant, who has neglected to send him a

        millionaire. Each one is as unhinged as their host, who retaliates to
        the intrusion in extreme fashion</image:caption
