        >Science Documentary hosted by Mathew Zajac and published by Channel 4
        broadcasted as part of CH4 Equinox series in 2000 - English narration At
        the dawn of a new century, a new theory is being born. It threatens to
        demolish the foundations of 20th century physics. Its authors are two of
        the world's leading cosmologists. If they're right, Einstein was wrong.
        It all began when Andy Albrecht and Joao Magueijo met at a conference in
        America in 1996. This program began from Newtonian view of the universe
        then takes you through the General Relativity and the Flatness problem.
        This leads to the Horizon problem and its solution, the Inflation
        theory. However modern astronomy doesn't stop here, the Inflation theory
        has its flaw too, and what happened before the big bang? This can all be
        answered by changing one thing, the one thing no body dare to question
        until now.</image:caption
