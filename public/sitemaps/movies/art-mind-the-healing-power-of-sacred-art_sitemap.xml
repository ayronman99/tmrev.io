        >In this innovative release, teacher and internationally exhibited
        artist Alex Grey considers the healing and transformative potential of
        sacred art. Grey looks back on the artists, traditions, and experiences
        that have shaped his career, and examines the metaphysical, mental,
        health, and emotional benefits that can be had from looking at sacred
        art created in places around the world.</image:caption
