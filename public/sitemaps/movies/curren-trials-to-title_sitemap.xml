        >Like all sports, surfing has always had it's heroes, but while many
        come and go, true heroes are never forgotten. Their legends only grow.
        In the world of surfing, no surfer proves this point better than
        Californias classic son, Tom Curren. While Curren came to power in the
        mid 80's with back to back World Titles, he became a legend in 1990.
        Ater a three year hiatus he reappeared and started from scratch,
        dominating the world of pro surfing in a way that can never be repeated.
        It's hard to pinpoint why Curren's legacy outweighs even his three
        incredible titles. Kelly Slater has long, since passed him and others
        like Andy Irons have matched it. Maybe it's the fact that Curren won al
        his titles in front o huge crowds instead of on remote reefs. Perhaps
        its his reluctant hero appeal that adds to his mystique. Or maybe its
        the fact that to this day he still holds the record for more tour
        victories over any other surfer... even Slater.</image:caption
