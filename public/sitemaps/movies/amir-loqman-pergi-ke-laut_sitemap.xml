        >Amir and Loqman, two lowly criminals who are just not cut out for the
        life of crime, resort to trying their hands at robbing money changers
        upon learning that they must pay a whopping RM30,000 to exit the
        `Brotherhood` they once so badly wanted to join. They now want only one
        thing - to set up a cafe by the sea and to spend the rest of their days
        serving drink to beautiful foreigners! They are oblivious to the fact
        that the Brotherhood are being hunted and viciously killed by three
        mysterious assassins. Will Amir and Loqman manage to escape the
        Brotherhood... alive?</image:caption
