        >One night, the Nohara family were enjoying a pleasant dream, when
        suddenly a big fish appeared in their dreams and ate them. The next
        morning, Hiroshi read in the newspaper that everybody in another town
        had the same nightmare as him, but it seemed to have ended. But Hiroshi
        also heard the same dream from Misae, Shinnosuke, Himawari and even
        Shiro. They were surprised and thought if the same thing is happening in
        Kasukabe too. In kindergarten, on telling others about his nightmare,
        Shinnosuke was surprised to know that everybody too had the same dream.
        Then a mysterious girl named Saki was transferred to Futaba Kindergarten
        and joined Shinnosuke's class. Everyone in the class, including the
        rather inactive Bo-chan, were all excited and happy on seeing her. But
        Saki had a cold attitude and didn't get along well.</image:caption
