        >The life and career of our 41st president, from his service in World
        War II and his early career in Texas to his days in the Oval Office,
        first as vice president to Ronald Reagan, then as the leader who
        presided over the first Gulf War. Drawing upon Bush's personal diaries
        and interviews with his closest advisors and most prominent critics, the
        film also explores Bush's role as the patriarch of a political family
        whose influence is unequaled in modern American life.</image:caption
