        >The film deals with the process of globalization based on the thought
        of geographer Milton Santos, who through his ideas and practices,
        inspires the debate about Brazilian society and the construction of a
        new world. Santos discusses his views on the importance of respecting
        difference and his belief that an alternative globalisation model could
        wholly enfranchise all citizens of the world. An illustrious presence in
        20th century social sciences, the man dubbed as ‘geography’s
        philosopher’ eloquently elucidates a developing world perspective on the
        global age.</image:caption
