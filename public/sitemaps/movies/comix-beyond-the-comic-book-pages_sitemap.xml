        >COMIX is a feature documentary on comic books, the comic book world,
        and the phenomenon surrounding them. It is told through the thoughts and
        images of some of the greatest talent in the comic book industry like
        Stan Lee, Frank Miller, Neal Adams, Mark Waid, Marc Silvestri, and John
        Romita Jr., among many others. COMIX also has tons of interviews with
        the fans, many in full costumes, as they share their love for the art
        form, and who have made comics the phenomenon that it is
        today.</image:caption
