        >Will Bastion returns home from the army after an absence of 20 years to
        bury his father, the former chief of thee Maori tribe, Ngati Kaipuku.
        The eldest son, he is reluctant to inherit his fathers role, so it is
        taken more willingly by his younger brother, Kahu. Kahu is the leader of
        a band of drug dealers and trouble-makers who ride horses through the
        middle of town, wrecking peoples gardens. Under the guise of refusal of
        a land settlement, Kahu makes a large marijuana deal with some murdering
        city folk. Will must choose between loyalty for his brother and his
        father, Maori tradition, and contemporary financial
        issues.</image:caption
