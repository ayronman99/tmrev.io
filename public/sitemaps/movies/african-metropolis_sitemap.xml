        >The vitality of the African city has provided local filmmakers with a
        rich array of stories for their films. African Metropolis presents six
        short films that examine the complexity of urban life in Abidjan, Cairo,
        Dakar, Johannesburg, Lagos and Nairobi. They run the gamut of genres,
        but in all the central character is the city itself. A Jewish pensioner
        lives alone in a Johannesburg apartment, the last resident of an
        ever-changing city. In a Nairobi of the future, one man searches for the
        girl of his dreams. Dakar is the backdrop to an intimate conversation
        between two women. Abidjan once played host to the American artist
        Jean-Michel Basquiat. In Cairo a musician sees the gap between rich and
        poor expand. And a final film confronts the perils of the poverty
        trap.</image:caption
