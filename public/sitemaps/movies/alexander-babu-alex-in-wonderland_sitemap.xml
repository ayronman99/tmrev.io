        >This is Alexâ€™s first solo standup special. This 120-minute show will
        include his typical rib-tickling and knee-slapping comedy and plenty of
        music and Tamil. Being passionate about music, Alex steals every
        opportunity to sing and play his musical instruments. Alex draws from
        his varied life experiences from growing up in a village in Tamil Nadu
        to working in corporate America, and brings unique colors to his acts.
        In this show, his insane optimism towards life will rub off on to you,
        and he will connect you with your own wonderland. A wonderful show that
        you can take your children, parents, elders and neighbors along and sit
        together and watch. The show is wholesome and clean and is
        7+.</image:caption
