        >In 1977 protesters occupied Bastion Point, after the announcement of a
        housing development on land once belonging to Ngāti Whātua. Five hundred
        and six days later, police and army arrived en masse to remove them.
        This documentary examines the rich and tragic history of Bastion
        Point/Takaparawhau — including how questionable methods were used to
        gradually take land from Māori, while basic amenities were withheld from
        those remaining. The Untold Story features extensive interviews with
        protest leader Joe Hawke, and footage from seminal documentary Bastion
        Point Day 507.</image:caption
