        >Ten years ago a series of brutal murders rocked peaceful, isolated Camp
        Blackwood. The killer was never caught and the camp, renamed "Camp
        Blood" by the locals, was never reopened.Ignorant of the camp's terrible
        history, two young couples visit Camp Blood. And they soon realise they
        are not alone. Someone is watching. Someone is waiting. The murders are
        far from over... they have only just begun.What began as a pleasant
        hiking trip turns into a savage struggle for survival. Will anyone make
        it out of Camp Blood alive?</image:caption
