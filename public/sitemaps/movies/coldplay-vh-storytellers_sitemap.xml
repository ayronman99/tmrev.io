        >Weeks before the much-anticipated release of their album X&Y, Coldplay
        took the stage at Brooklyn Academy Of Music for an intimate night of
        storytelling and live music. Chris Martin, Will Champion, Guy Berryman,
        and Jon Buckland debuted new tunes ("Square One," "Fix You"), revisited
        old favorites ("Clocks," "Yellow") and even shared a song they wrote for
        Johnny Cash ("Till Kingdom Come"). Chris explained that "Yellow" was
        inspired by the Yellow Pages ("In an alternative universe this song
        would be called Playboy") and revealed "Speed Of Sound" was an attempt
        to rip-off Kate Bush's "Running Up That Hill." It was a magical night
        for the introspective Britpop heavyweights.</image:caption
