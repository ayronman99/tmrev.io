        >Anne’s mixed Dutch – Javanese parentage causes her father to be
        banished by his family. After building his own plantation, Anne’s father
        dies in an accident when she was a child. When she turns 10, Jogja is in
        a crisis. Anne’s school is closed, and the company run by her Dutch
        mother has to be handed over to the locals. The plantation is taken over
        by Satrio’s father. Satrio is a friend of Anne. This change leads to the
        death of Anne's mother, so Anne moves to Solo and opens a successful
        batik business. Apparently Satrio secretly helps her by buying her batik
        as he is still in love with Anne. But he can’t pursue her as he is
        arranged to marry a princess from the Sultan’s palace. Anne finally
        learns of Satrio’s deeds, but she also has to bury her feelings, as she
        has lung cancer. She decides to give Satrio a piece of batik that she
        personally makes as the wedding present.</image:caption
