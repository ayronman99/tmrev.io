        >College student Ella is completely focused on her ambiguously romantic
        relationship with her dorm-mate, Chris. She is so consumed by trying to
        understand his behavior that she's neglecting the screenplay she is
        supposed to write in order to graduate. When she does sit down to work
        on the script, her increasingly awkward social life bleeds onto the page
        and her work begins to express her true feelings about her own
        situation.</image:caption
