        >Ask people, the world over, to name a great English novelist and
        chances are the name at the top of the list will be Charles Dickens, the
        author responsible for creating such all-time classics as "Oliver
        Twist", "Nicholas Nickleby", "Great Expectations" and the holiday
        classic, "A Christmas Carol". Even in the 21st Century, his novels are
        still proving inspirational. And when it comes to costume drama, with a
        touch of glamor, gritty realism and social conscience, Dickens has a
        message as resonant today. Follow in the footsteps of Dickens, back to
        an age of romance, sentimentality and Victorian sensibility. From humble
        beginnings in his birthplace in Portsmouth, to the luxurious elegance of
        Gad's Hill Place in Kent, experience a tour of the landscapes that truly
        inspired the great author.</image:caption
