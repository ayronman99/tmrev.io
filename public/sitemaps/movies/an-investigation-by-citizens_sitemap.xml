        >In late August 2008, following the 100th day of the Sichuan Earthquake,
        rescue teams began to withdraw and the media ceased to report on the
        disasters at the schools. Chengdu environmentalist Tan Zuoren and local
        volunteers were still rushing from one collapsed school to the next,
        trying to find out why they had collapsed. Autumn went and winter came,
        Tan Zuoren and Xie Yihui had visited ten counties and cities and over
        eighty towns and townships in the main disaster region, covering a
        distance of about 3,000km. They managed to release an investigate report
        on the internet before the 1st anniversary of the May 12 Earthquake.
        This is the first investigative report conducted by independent citizens
        on the collapsed schools.</image:caption
