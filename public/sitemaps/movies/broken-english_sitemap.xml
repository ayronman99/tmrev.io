        >Nora Wilder (Parker Posey), a single, career woman works at a Manhattan
        boutique hotel where her excellent skills in guest relations lack in the
        romantic department. If it is not her loving and dominant mother (Gena
        Rowlands) attempting to set her up that consistently fail, she has her
        friendâ€™s (Drea de Matteo) disastrous blind dates to rely on as a backup
        for further dismay. She's surrounded by friends who are all happily
        engaged or romantically involved and somehow, love escapes Nora -- until
        she meets an unusual Frenchman (Melvil Poupaud) who helps her discover
        life beyond her self-imposed boundaries.</image:caption
