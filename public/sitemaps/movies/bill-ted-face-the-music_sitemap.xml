        >Yet to fulfil their rock and roll destiny, the now middle-aged best
        friends Bill and Ted set out on a new adventure when a visitor from the
        future warns them that only their song can save life as we know it.
        Along the way, they are helped by their daughters, a new batch of
        historical figures and a few music legends â€” to seek the song that will
        set their world right and bring harmony to the universe.</image:caption
