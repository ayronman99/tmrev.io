        >In West Africa during the late 17th century, King Adanggaman leads a
        war against his neighboring tribes, ordering his soldiers to torch enemy
        villages, kill the elderly and capture the healthy tribesmen to sell to
        the European slave traders. When his village falls prey to one of
        Adanggaman's attacks, Ossei manages to escape, but his family is
        murdered except for his captured mother. Chasing after the soldiers in
        an effort to free her, Ossei is befriended by a fierce warrior named
        Naka.</image:caption
