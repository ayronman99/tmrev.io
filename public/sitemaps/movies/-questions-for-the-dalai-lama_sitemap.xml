        >How do you reconcile a commitment to non-violence when faced with
        violence? Why do the poor often seem happier than the rich? Must a
        society lose its traditions in order to move into the future? These are
        some of the questions posed to His Holiness the Dalai Lama by filmmaker
        and explorer Rick Ray. Ray examines some of the fundamental questions of
        our time by weaving together observations from his own journeys
        throughout India and the Middle East, and the wisdom of an extraordinary
        spiritual leader. This is his story, as told and filmed by Rick Ray
        during a private visit to his monastery in Dharamsala, India over the
        course of several months. Also included is rare historical footage as
        well as footage supplied by individuals who at great personal risk,
        filmed with hidden cameras within Tibet.</image:caption
