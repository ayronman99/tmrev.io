        >22 Female Kottayam, also known as 22FK, is a 2012 Indian rape and
        revenge film directed by Aashiq Abu and starring Rima Kallingal and
        Fahad Fazil in the lead roles. The film deals with the travails of a
        nurse who was victimised for no fault of hers and who takes revenge on
        her tormentors in a rather unusual manner. Set and filmed in Bangalore,
        the film released on April 13, 2012, and received strongly positive
        reviews from critics. It was also well received at the
        box-office.</image:caption
