        >Sondra Wellington (Anya Benton) is bossy, controlling, and extremely
        unpleasant. But everything changes when a special friend from Sondra's
        past transforms her into Bella -- her assistant's loveable little
        Chihuahua. While Sondra lives as Bella, her real body is in a coma. In
        order to gain access to the hospital, Sondra must prove that she has
        what it takes to be a therapy dog. As she learns the tricks of the
        trade, she becomes more connected with the people around her and
        realizes her past mistakes. It appears that Sondra is finally ready to
        turn over a new leaf in her own life --that is, if she ever gets the
        chance.</image:caption
