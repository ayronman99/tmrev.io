        >Copyright Criminals examines the creative and commercial value of
        musical sampling, including the related debates over artistic
        expression, copyright law, and (of course) money. This documentary
        traces the rise of hip-hop from the urban streets of New York to its
        current status as a multibillion-dollar industry. For more than thirty
        years, innovative hip-hop performers and producers have been re-using
        portions of previously recorded music in new, otherwise original
        compositions. When lawyers and record companies got involved, what was
        once referred to as a “borrowed melody” became a “copyright
        infringement.” The film showcases many of hip-hop music’s founding
        figures like Public Enemy, De La Soul, and Digital Underground—while
        also featuring emerging hip-hop artists from record labels Definitive
        Jux, Rhymesayers, Ninja Tune, and more.</image:caption
