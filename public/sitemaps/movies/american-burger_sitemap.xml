        >A bus load of American students, all jocks, cheerleaders and nerds, are
        on a culture trip in Europe when they stumble upon a mysterious
        Hamburger stand in the deep European woods, selling 100% American
        Burgers. A visit to the Burger Factory behind the stand, renders them
        trapped in this unknown territory, and they are about to realize that
        European notion of American Hamburgers is terrifyingly different from
        what they're used to... The road trip descends into a battle for
        survival as Americans are treated as cows. Who's going to end up in the
        slaughterhouse? Will the nerds ever get to score with the cheerleaders?
        Cliques are formed... Strategies are made... And in the midst of it all
        they learn a thing or two about friendship, survival, consumerism, horny
        teenage urges and, perhaps most importantly, to never visit a fast-food
        restaurant ever again. And the nerds somehow end up having the... Best.
        Summer. Ever.</image:caption
