        >Sometime in the near future, paraplegic prison inmate Matt Mills meets
        "The Board" of Satoshi-Telefair Industries, who thank him for joining
        the Program. Under pressure and with a promise to make him walk again,
        Mills agrees to volunteer. He is injected with a synthetic nanomaterial
        and suffocated, only to wake up with restored use of his legs, yet alone
        in a steel cell in the first spoke of an experimental apparatus - The
        Wheel. A series of assailants inflict a multitude of damage to Mills'
        body and torment his mind, yet the synthetic nanomaterial not only
        restores his damaged organs, it re-engineers his strength. The
        experiment might be designed to kill, but Mills is determined to survive
        - and get back to his daughter before The Board finds her
        first.</image:caption
