        >Aja was the biggest selling album of Steely Dan's illustrious career.
        It was the first album by Donald Fagen and Walter Becker as a duo. Fagen
        and Becker recall the history of the album, along with Peg, Deacon Blues
        and Josie. Michael McDonald, later of the Doobie Brothers did guest
        backing vocals on Aja, the late British musician Ian Dury, record
        producer Gary Katz and the legendary session musicians who worked on Aja
        also contribute. This is a vivd portrait of a 70's record that is still
        as fresh and as memorable more than two decades after its
        release.</image:caption
