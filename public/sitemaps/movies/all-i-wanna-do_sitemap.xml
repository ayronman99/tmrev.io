        >'All I Wanna Do' follows the dreams of a 48-year-old Simohamed who
        works as a parking guard and his 17-year-old son who acts in Hollywood
        films such as 'Charlie Wilson's War' posing as the crippled Afghan boy
        or Iraqi war victim. When his dreams of going to Hollywood are dashed he
        turns to music and forms a hip hop group with his father leaving his
        slum. Like fish out of water, the duo set out to meet their heroes,
        enter studios and radio stations for the first time in an adventure
        through the music industry of Casablanca.</image:caption
