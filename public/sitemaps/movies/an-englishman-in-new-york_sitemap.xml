        >Biographical drama based on the last 20 years of Crisp's life. The
        literary figure and gay iconoclast emigrated to New York in 1981 and
        lived there until his death. The film observes Crisp in both his public
        and private lives, from his seemingly cavalier response to the outbreak
        of AIDS to his tender relationship with his friend Patrick Angus and his
        own response to growing old.</image:caption
