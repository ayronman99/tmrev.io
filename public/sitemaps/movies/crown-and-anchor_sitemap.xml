        >When James Downey returns home to Newfoundland for his mother’s
        funeral, he is faced with all the haunting family issues he thought he
        had left behind. He channeled his own inner demons from an abusive
        father into being a police officer but his cousin Danny’s childhood
        trauma has exploded into a cycle of drugs, crime and violence. James
        must confront his tortured past, decide who he really is, and deal with
        his cousin before it’s too late.</image:caption
