        >Kidnapped in childhood. Raised as an assassin. Shiori's spent her
        entire life following the orders of her mysterious masters, never
        questioning the commands that have sentenced hundreds to die at her
        hands. But when a childhood memory suddenly resurfaces, the programming
        in her head is short circuited and her entire world is turned upside
        down! Now, before her masters realize she's slipped their leash, Shiori
        has to escape. But to do so means she must kill again... even the ones
        who are close to her!</image:caption
