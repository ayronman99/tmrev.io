        >Aggie, A 67 year-old Black Cajun, has just stepped into her worst
        nightmare. Her two granddaughters have disappeared, and the only clue
        she possesses is a forgotten laptop. Aware she only has a short window
        of time, she feels helpless to save them as her money and influence are
        scarce. Desperate to get her girls back, Aggie risks everything to cross
        paths with Richard and Lottie DuMonde, two of the wealthiest and most
        connected people in New Orleans. Certainly, once they hear her story,
        they will help. But what Aggie doesn't foresee is the dark world she's
        about to step into, or the dangers accompanying the rescue needed to
        bring her girls home.</image:caption
