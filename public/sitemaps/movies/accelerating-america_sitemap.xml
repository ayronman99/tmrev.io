        >Tells the story of a revolutionary school in Rhode Island that gives
        inner-city youths who are at risk of dropping out a second chance by
        accelerating their studies. At the head of the school is a fearless
        principal, Robert DeBlois, who as a quadriplegic knows something about
        overcoming adversity. If the word "inspiring" gets overused, it rarely
        feels as apt as when watching DeBlois apply his tough love educational
        techniques on hardened teens. We watch three students - America, Jason
        and Yazmine - as they struggle through a make-or-break year, drawing
        upon conviction, pride and humor in order to survive.</image:caption
