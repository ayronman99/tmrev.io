        >In 1996, Doctor Who returned as a TV Movie, filmed on location in
        Vancouver, Canada. Actress Daphne Ashbrook was cast as the eighth
        Doctor’s assistant, Grace Holloway. Bold and new, the film gave Paul
        McGann the chance to play Doctor Who and Daphne made Grace a powerful
        and uncompromising character … and a controversial love interest for The
        Doctor! In the Summer of 2004, Daphne visited the UK to make some
        personal appearances and re-join the world of Doctor Who, by recording
        an audio play, The Next Life, for Big Finish! In this unique programme,
        featuring interviews, appearances, signings … and film of Daphne’s Big
        Finish recording with Paul McGann, we discover much about this talented
        actress and her memories of filming the Doctor Who TV
        Movie.</image:caption
