        >It's 1975, and Martin is a teenager looking to break out of a stifling
        home environment ruled by his alcoholic father and long-suffering
        mother. When Martin's pal Micke suggests they get jobs together as
        waiters at a resort off the Swedish coast, Martin is all for it, but
        before long Micke finds better things to do and Martin is left on his
        own. The presence of pretty fellow server Jenny is a major consolation,
        but to his surprise, guileless Martin is soon chosen as the protégé of
        Gösta, the resort's short-tempered manager. Gösta clearly likes Martin
        and makes him his right hand man, which gives Martin a crash course in
        the seedy side of life when he discovers Gösta has a number of other
        business interests, not all of which are legal or
        ethical.</image:caption
