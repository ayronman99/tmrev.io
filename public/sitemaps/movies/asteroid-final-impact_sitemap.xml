        >A deadly meteor storm has been labeled a one-time celestial occurrence,
        but astrophysicist Steve Thomas believes something worse is yet to come.
        After discovering his asteroid tracking satellite is secretly being used
        for military surveillance, Steve leaks the truth to the press, and it
        costs him his reputation, his job, and his friends. With the backlash of
        being a whistle-blower, the pressure threatens to tear his family apart,
        just when Steve discovers a threat to the entire planet: a giant dark
        asteroid invisible to current detection systems will soon strike the
        Earth. Barred from using his own satellite to prove the asteroid's
        existence, Steve is forced to work in the shadows in a desperate attempt
        to save humanity.</image:caption
