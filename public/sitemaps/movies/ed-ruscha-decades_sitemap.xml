        >Ed Ruscha made his very first art in his native Oklahoma, but soon
        became attracted to Los Angeles . Curator Margit Rowell has examined his
        extensive body of work and created a brilliant exhibition of his seldom
        seen drawings. Rowell visits Ruscha in his studio, looking at new
        paintings with the artist, discussing his progress over the decades and
        asking him to comment on the many milestones in his large retrospective
        exhibition at MoCA in Los Angeles.</image:caption
