        >What do Jessica Chastain, Viola Davis, Patti LuPone and Alex Sharp have
        in common? They are but a few of the extraordinary actors who have

        performing arts school. This compelling portrait of the master teacher -
        the sole remaining founder of the school's legendary Drama Division -
        takes us inside the drama classes where Moni and his wife Mina pour
        their love and passion into preparing the next generation of actors for
        the spotlight.</image:caption
