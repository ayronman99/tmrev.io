        >The stars of Starship Troopers are back in action! Mike (Casper Van
        Dien) decides to hit the road on his refurbished classic motorcycle
        along with best buddy Alex (Patrick Muldoon), but their trek takes a
        surprising turn when they become involved in a plan involving political
        blackmail, corruption, and dirty money. Carrying evidence that could get
        them killed at any minute, the boys are chased on the open road but turn
        their skills to their own advantage. William Forsythe (Raising Arizona)
        and Theresa Russell (Wild Things) also star in this gun-blazing,
        rip-roaring adventure from the director of Every Which Way But Loose
        youÂ’ll never forget!</image:caption
