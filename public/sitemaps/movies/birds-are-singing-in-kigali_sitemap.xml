        >We meet ornithologist Anna in 1994 just as genocide is raging in
        Rwanda, perpetrated by the majority Hutus against the Tutsis. Anna
        manages to save the daughter of a colleague whose family has been
        murdered, and she takes her to Poland. But the woman returns to Rwanda
        to visit the graves of her loved ones. The director originally worked on
        the movie with her husband Krzysztof Krauze (My Nikifor â€“ Crystal Globe,
        KVIFF 2005), but after his death in 2014 she eventually finished this
        challenging picture alone.</image:caption
