        >Of all the great ballerinas, Tanaquil Le Clercq may have been the most
        transcendent. With a body unlike any before hers, she mesmerized viewers
        and choreographers alike. With her elongated, race-horse physique, she
        became the new prototype for the great George Balanchine. Because of her
        extraordinary movement and unique personality on stage, she became a
        muse to two of the greatest choreographers in dance, George Balanchine
        and Jerome Robbins. She eventually married Balanchine, and Robbins
        created his famous version of Afternoon of a Faun for her. She had love,
        fame, adoration, and was the foremost dancer of her day until it
        suddenly all stopped. At the age of 27, she was struck down by polio and
        paralyzed. She never danced again. The ballet world has been haunted by
        her story ever since.</image:caption
