        >Bill Bellamy is back...and this time he's making a statement! Over the
        last decade, Bill Bellamy has been a staple in the world of comedy. The
        man, who coined the popular 90's phrase "Booty Call," has made several
        appearances on Def Comedy Jam, hosted MTV's Beach House and starred
        alongside Jamie Foxx and Al Pacino in Any Given Sunday. Bellamy's "in
        your face" brand of comedy has made him a successful touring act with
        hundreds of sold-out shows nationwide.</image:caption
