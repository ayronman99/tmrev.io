        >Tells the story of detective Remo Bellini, who gets pulled into a web
        of death and mysteries that take him to a world of illusions where
        everything is a self-created fantasy. He's taken by this evil inside
        that makes him lose a sense of reality with visions, anguish and
        loneliness - everything takes him down a path of no return. He can't
        understand what's happening, but the deaths surrounding him are getting
        closer and closer. It's a race against time before it's too
        late.</image:caption
