        >Martha is a businesswoman and divorced mother of two children - Augusta
        and Jack. However, when docile Augusta becomes a teenager, feelings of
        anger and self-hate cause her personality to undergo a scary
        transformation, and Martha realizes that this is not just typical teen
        angst. Augusta begins doing drugs, drinking, and ends up on the streets.
        Her concerned mother and father reach out to an educational consultant,
        who advises them to send Augusta to a strict wilderness camp for
        troubled teens. However, even the institution's experienced and tough
        administrators find Augusta a difficulty to keep under control. Martha
        comes to realize that there is no answer to her daughter's
        behavior.</image:caption
