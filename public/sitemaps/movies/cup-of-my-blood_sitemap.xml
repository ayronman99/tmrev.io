        >The lonely artist Jack Fender still grieves the death of his beloved
        lover Tina three years ago. He lost his inspiration and his faith in God
        and presently he is taking pornographic pictures for the mobster Sparky
        and his partner Limpy for a pornographic site managed by Nibbles and
        Scooter under the protest of his agent and friend Alex. When Jack
        witnesses a car accident in his neighborhood, the wounded passenger
        gives a box to Jack, asking him to protect and never open it, and he
        discovers that he is protecting the Holy Grail. From this moment on,
        weird things happen to Jack: visions, nightmares and the permanent
        sensation that strangers are watching him. While swimming late night in
        a club, Jack meets the sexy Iona and his inspiration returns but he also
        finds the hidden reality.</image:caption
