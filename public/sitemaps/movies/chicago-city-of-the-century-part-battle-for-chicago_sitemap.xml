        >City of the Century tells how in just 60 years Chicago grew from a
        remote, swampy frontier town into one of the most explosively alive
        cities in the world. It's the story of the wealthy and the indigent, the
        heralded and the forgotten, the shop assistants and the millionaire
        retail barons who together created Chicago. It describes how through
        innovation, ingenuity, determination and sheer ruthlessness, the
        captains of industry created empires in a marshy wasteland. And it
        explores the hardships endured by the millions of working men and women
        -- most of them immigrants from Ireland and Northern Europe -- whose
        labor helped a capitalist class reinvent the way America did
        business.</image:caption
