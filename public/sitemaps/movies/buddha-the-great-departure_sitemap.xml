        >Prince Siddhartha is heir to the Shakya kingdom, which is constantly at
        war with the more powerful Kosala kingdom. His father tries to raise as
        him as a warrior leader and to shield him from the miseries of the
        world. Meeting the young outcast girl Migaila, Siddhartha experiences
        love for the first time but also witnesses the suffering that afflicts
        humankind. Meanwhile, in Kosala, Chapra rises through the military,
        despite his lowly origins, to become a hero and general of the army. A
        final showdown between the two kingdoms forces Siddhartha to re-evaluate
        the path he is following.</image:caption
