        >This film is a remake of the 1989 Doraemon Movie 10: Nobita no Nippon
        Tanjou. Nobita and the gang run away from home, traveling back in time
        to 70,000 years ago before Japan was even born. After a while, they
        return to the present. However, when they bump into a young caveman,
        Kukuru, who they have accidentally transported forward to their current
        era, they realize they must take him back to the primitive age. On top
        of that, they will have to save Kukuru's tribe, called the Hikari tribe,
        which was attacked and abducted by the Giganzonbie and Kurayami
        tribe.</image:caption
