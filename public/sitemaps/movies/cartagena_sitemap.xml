        >Muriel is beautiful, free-spirited and bed-ridden since a horrific
        accident. Leo is a drunk middle-aged ex-boxer. Desperate for work and
        unqualified, he interviews for Muriel, who hires him to cook and care
        for her against her better judgment. Initially out of his depth, Leo
        slowly wins Muriel's trust. As Muriel teaches him to read, he forces her
        to confront the joys beyond her window.</image:caption
