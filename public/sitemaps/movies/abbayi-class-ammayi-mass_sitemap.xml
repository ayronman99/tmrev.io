        >Sri(Varun Sandeh) is brought up by his grandmother (Sri Lakshmi) after
        the death of his parents. Sriâ€™s grandmother is very protective and she
        keeps him away from beautiful girls. As a result, Sri is very
        uncomfortable near women. One fine day, a young and rich girl named
        Anjali comes up to Sri and proposes to him. Sri blindly
        refuses.</image:caption
