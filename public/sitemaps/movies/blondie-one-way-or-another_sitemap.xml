        >A documentary about New York band Blondie, from their early beginnings
        in Bowery clubs like CBGBs alongside other up and coming bands like The
        Ramones, Patti Smith &amp; Talking Heads. The documentary tracks their
        years of international success, through their internal problems and
        decline and then to their recovery and re-establishment leading to their
        being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006 - an event
        that wasn't without its problems. Lots of interviews with band members,
        past and present, and their friends and contemporaries. Lots of clips of
        them performing through the years.</image:caption
