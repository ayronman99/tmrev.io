        >Omeris, a Turkish Cypriot boy, grows up with Greek-Cypriots in the
        innocent years of his homeland. He has been taught that human beings
        have no differences between them, whether they call themselves Greek or
        Turk, Muslim or Christian. When he falls in love with a Greek-Cypriot
        girl, he realizes that the world is not as he imagined it to be.The game
        of love has many surprises in store for him. Destiny ordains that he
        fight so that he can stay with his beloved, at a moment when the people
        around him are moving in exactly the opposite direction, towards
        separation and partition. If he doesn't want to be defeated he must
        fight the absurdity of fanaticism that is invading his personal life and
        is trying to crush it.</image:caption
