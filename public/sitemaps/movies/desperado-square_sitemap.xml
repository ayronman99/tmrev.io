        >In ha-Argazim, a neighborhood that time forgot, the one-year
        anniversary of Morris Mandabon's death is approaching, and his youngest
        son, Nissim has had a dream in which his father orders him to re-open
        the old neighborhood movie theater, thus breaking the vow that Morris
        had made years before never to screen movies again. Nissim and his
        brother George, together with Aharon Gabardine, who was the
        projectionist back in the old days, are determined to fulfill Morris'
        request. The same day Nissim has his dream, Avram Mandabon, Morris'
        brother, returns for his brother's memorial after a 25-year absence. His
        reappearance causes old family feuds to resurface.</image:caption
