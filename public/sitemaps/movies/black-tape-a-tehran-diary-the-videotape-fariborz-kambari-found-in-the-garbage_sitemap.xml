        >Banned in Iran this experimental film uses fictionalized, grainy, home
        video footage to tell the story of the abusive relationship between a
        successful middle aged Iranian businessman and his 18 year old wife,
        Goli. She has just received a camcorder as his birthday present and the
        entire story is told from the view of this camcorder. Goli has lived
        with him and been his sex slave since he took her captive as a nine year
        old from her family in the Kurdish rebellion. Now she is pregnant, but
        as she starts to talk back to him and he discovers that she has learned
        English and started to read, he again is making her more and more a
        prisoner in his home.</image:caption
