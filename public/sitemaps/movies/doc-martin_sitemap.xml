        >Doc Martin tells the tale of Martin Clunes' character in the film, in
        the months leading up to the Saving Grace story. Martin Bamford is a
        heart-broken London obstetrician, in a jealous rage after he finds out
        that his wife has been sleeping with three of his buddies. He escapes to
        a small Cornish fishing village, which he grows surprisingly attached
        to, and is extremely reluctant to return with his cheating wife when she
        comes to pick him up. Although he has only been looking for a week's R
        &amp; R, Dr Bamford stumbles across a network of secrets in the village
        of Port Isaac, and finds himself embroiled in the most exciting scandal
        the village has seen for centuries.</image:caption
