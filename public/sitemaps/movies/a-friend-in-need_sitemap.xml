        >In bleak Yeouido, crowded by the political world, press and stock
        companies, section chief Hwang Woo-Jin works in a stock trading firm. He
        is a hard-working salaryman, but is the first to be laid off. With an
        outstanding private loan to pay for, hospital bills for his father and
        consistent conflicts with his devoted wife, stress gradually suffocates
        Hwang Woo-Jin. Finally, a junior staff member and a boss, who he trusts,
        conspire to kick him out. After finding about their scheme, Hwang
        Woo-Jin becomes desperate. In front of him, his friend Jung-Hoon, who
        does do anything for justice, appears. Under the influence of alcohol,
        Woo-Jin tells Jung-Hoon that he wants to kill them. The next day the
        junior staff member is found dead.</image:caption
