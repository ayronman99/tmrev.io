        >Guy and his sister grow up on an island. His domineering mother keeps
        watch over everything from the tip of a lighthouse, his eccentric father
        experiments in the basement laboratory. Then there are the orphans, on
        whose heads the adoptive parents later find puzzling wounds. Another
        brother and sister pair is sent to the island: the Lightball Kids, two
        detectives that are meant to bring light into the darkness. The brothers
        and sisters are all yanked into the emotional roller coaster of first
        love, while something cryptic comes to light in the parents'
        house.</image:caption
