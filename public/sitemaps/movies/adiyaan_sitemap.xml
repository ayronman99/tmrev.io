        >Sarath, a 28 years old boy belonging to a lower caste falls in love
        with Nayana who belongs to an upper caste and her father is a superior
        officer in the police department. Harichandran (Nayana’s Father) comes
        into know about the relationship through one of his sub ordinates,
        Sreenath who is also belonging to Nayana’s caste. Both Harichandran and
        Sreenath plan a crooked idea to trap Sarath in a smuggling case. Crime
        branch officers led by SI Jayram arrests Sarath and forces him to accept
        that he has committed the crime but Sarath disagree. Brutal harassment
        and tortures lead to the death of Sarath in police custody. Custody
        murders have been the heading of our newspapers since a long time. But
        the unfortunate thing is that such stories are still remaining as
        stories only. Adiyaan raises its fingers to this brutal reality of
        casteism and superior torturing that really exists around
        us.</image:caption
