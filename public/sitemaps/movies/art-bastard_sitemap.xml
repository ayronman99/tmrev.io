        >What is art and how does it relate to society? Is its value determined
        by its popularity or originality? Is the goal profit or expressing one's
        personal vision? These are some of the questions raised as we follow
        fiercely independent New York artist Robert Cenedella in his artistic
        journey through decades of struggling for creative expression. A
        student, protégé and friend of German artist George Grosz, Cenedella is
        now passing on the legacy of Grosz's approach to art, in the very same
        room where Grosz taught. In portraying Cenedella's determination to buck
        the system of what's popular while critiquing that popularity in his
        attempt to turn the art world upside down, ART BASTARD is a funny,
        touching, and insightful look inside the maverick mind of a true
        original.</image:caption
