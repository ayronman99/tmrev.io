        >A rookie scientist at a stem cell research institute witnesses abnormal
        activity from a mouse which has been administered a developing drug at
        the laboratory. The mouse has become extremely ferocious and injures him
        by biting him in the hand. Although the mouse is destroyed and discarded
        according to the supervisor’s orders, he feels something is wrong when
        the supervisor and his colleagues dismiss the incident and stubbornly
        refuse to investigate the cause of the abnormal behaviour. Although he
        raises concern about the safety of the product to human bodies, the
        supervisor keeps denying it while claiming that there’s no defect in
        their research, whose goal is to create human happiness. It’s clear
        there’s a hidden agenda with dire consequences for him and
        humanity.</image:caption
