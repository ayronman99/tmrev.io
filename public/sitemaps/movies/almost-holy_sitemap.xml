        >After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Ukraine's social and political
        institutions faced massive change, including an increasingly corrupt
        government and crippled infrastructure. A number of the nation's youth
        wound up homeless and addicted to a lethal cocktail of injected cold
        medicine and alcohol. In the early 2000s a pastor from Mariupol named
        Gennadiy Mokhnenko took up the fight against child homelessness by
        forcibly abducting street kids and bringing them to his Pilgrim Republic
        rehabilitation centerâ€”the largest organization of its kind in the former
        Soviet Union. Gennadiy's ongoing efforts and unabashedly tough love
        approach to his city's problems has made him a folk hero for some, and a
        lawless vigilante to others. Despite criticism, Gennadiy is determined
        to continue his work.</image:caption
