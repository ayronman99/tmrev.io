        >What does it mean to be Black in America in the 21st century? The
        recently formed Black American film group TNEGâ„¢ has set out to elucidate
        this very question. Hearing from the likes of fine artist Kara Walker
        and musical artist Flying Lotus, the film is based on a deceptively
        simple approach -- asking a refined list of black 'specialists' as well
        as 'uncommon folks' questions about what they think, and more
        importantly as lead director Arthur Jafa states, 'What they KNOW' -- the
        film is an unprecedented 'stream of the black consciousness' and a
        strikingly original and rarefied look at black intellectual and
        emotional life. What's so unorthodox about this simple approach is that
        the interviews were recorded separately from the images in the film.
        What results is a breathtaking, kaleidoscopic look of American black
        life from the dawn of three original filmmakers.</image:caption
