        >The events of the film revolve around an unfortunate family that
        arrives at the Al-Gharib palace, and the joy of the couple and their
        three sons in their new home soon dissipates after the house gradually
        begins to absorb them one by one into a terrifying world full of old
        crimes that occurred between its walls, or that the ill-fated walls were
        behind those crimes.</image:caption
