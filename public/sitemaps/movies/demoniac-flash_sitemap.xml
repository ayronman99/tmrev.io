        >Two young men who always dream of joining the show biz meet a frivolous
        young actress in an old house during shooting of a movie. The three also
        befriended a couple living next door whose son died of traffic accident
        years ago. They also come to know a freakish cartoonist in the
        neighborhood. But the two young men have never expected that people
        around them are suffering from nightmares, and their own nightmares are
        about to begin.</image:caption
