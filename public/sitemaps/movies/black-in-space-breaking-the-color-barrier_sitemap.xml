        >America's experiences during the Civil Rights Movement and the Space
        Race are well documented. However, few know about the moment these two
        worlds collided, when the White House and NASA scrambled to put the
        first black astronaut into orbit. This is the untold story of the
        decades-long battle between the U.S. and the Soviet Union to be the
        first superpower to bring diversity to the skies, told by the black
        astronauts and their families, who were part of this little known
        chapter of the Cold War.</image:caption
