        >The South of France. Internationally famous pianist Aurore collapses
        one night during a performance, over-exhausted from too many concerts.
        Tired of music, she believes she no longer has anything to offer her
        public. Then she meets Jean, an electrician who installs residential
        security systems. Despite their differences, they immediately fall in
        love and plan a new life together. Jean intends to leave his long-time
        partner, Dolor√®s, but she will stop at nothing to keep
        him.</image:caption
