        >In a provincial suburb, three neighbours come to terms with the
        consequences of the new world of social media. Marie, who lives off her
        husband’s family allowance, is afraid of losing her son’s respect
        because of a sex tape. Bertrand can’t say no to advertising calls and is
        fighting to protect his daughter, who is being bullied online.
        Christine, after losing everything because of her addiction to TV
        series, wonders why her rating as an Uber driver is not taking off.
        These three lone fighters are incapable of finding a solution to their
        problems on their own — until they join forces to declare war on the
        tech giants.</image:caption
