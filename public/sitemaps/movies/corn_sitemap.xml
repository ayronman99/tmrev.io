        >A young woman returns home to bear an illegitimate child, and witnesses
        an environmental accident involving a genetically modified crop of corn.
        Doubted by the community she has returned to, she questions her own
        sanity as she tries to discover what is happening. Her journey takes her
        on a trip down the food chain, as she tracks a potentially life
        threatening byproduct from the cornfield to the supermarket. Ultimately,
        she has to confront psychological demons that haunt her as she grows
        into motherhood, and comes to terms with her own biology. Tapping into
        cultural myths of food, fertility, birth and sacrifice, CORN is a
        chilling look at what we put in our mouths and our babies' mouths, and
        the convergence of Science and Mother Nature.</image:caption
