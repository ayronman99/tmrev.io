        >The first feature-length documentary film to fully investigate the
        growing threat to Earth's life-support systems from the loss of
        biodiversity. If current trends continue, scientists warn that half or
        more of all plant and animal species on Earth will become extinct within
        the next few decades. Call of Life investigates the scope, the causes,
        and the predicted effects of this unprecedented loss of life, but also
        looks deeper, at the ways in which both culture and psychology have
        helped to create and perpetuate the situation. The film not only tells
        the story of a crisis in nature, but also in human nature, a crisis more
        complex and threatening than anything human beings have ever faced
        before.</image:caption
