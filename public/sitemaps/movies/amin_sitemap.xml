        >Amin has come from Senegal to work in France, leaving behind his wife
        AÃ¯cha, and their three children. He leads a solitary life in France,
        where the only space he occupies is his home and the building sites on
        which he works. Most of his earnings are sent to Senegal. One day, he
        meets a woman, Gabrielle, and a relationship is born.</image:caption
