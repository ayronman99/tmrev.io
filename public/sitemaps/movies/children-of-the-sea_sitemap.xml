        >Ruka is a young girl whose parents are separated and whose father works
        in an aquarium. When two boys, Umi and Sora, who were raised in the sea
        by dugongs, are brought to the aquarium, Ruka feels drawn to them and
        begins to realize that she has the same sort of supernatural connection
        to the ocean that they do. Umi and Sora's special power seems to be
        connected to strange events that have been occurring more and more
        frequently, such as the appearance of sea creatures far from their home
        territory and the disappearance of aquarium animals around the world.
        However, the exact nature of the boys' power and of the abnormal events
        is unknown, and Ruka gets drawn into investigating the mystery that
        surrounds her new friends.</image:caption
