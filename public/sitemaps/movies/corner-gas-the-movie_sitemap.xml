        >It’s been a few years, and there’s still not a lot going on 40
        kilometers from nowhere. But that’s all about to change as the fine
        folks of Dog River, Saskatchewan face their biggest crisis ever. Brent
        and the gang discover that the town’s been badly mismanaged, leaving
        residents with little choice but to pack up and leave. As residents make
        one last rally to save Dog River as they know it, they discover a
        devious plan by a corporate chain that would change life for Dog
        Riverites forever.</image:caption
