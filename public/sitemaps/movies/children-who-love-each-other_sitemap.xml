        >A family vacation in the mountains. Nine-year-old Eliane is as free as
        a caged bird. She tries to escape her bossy mother, who lives in a state
        of pathological stress that affects Eliane and her siblings.
        Partially-deaf, Eliane uses her disability to protect herself from the
        adults around her. Despite the emotional bruising and trauma, she faces
        up to her own isolation and looks for freedom in wide open
        spaces.</image:caption
