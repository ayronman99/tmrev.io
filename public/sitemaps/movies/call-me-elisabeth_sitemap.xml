        >A 10-year-old girl lives in post WWII rural France with her parents,
        who are about to divorce. Her older sister leaves home to finish school,
        and the young girl is left with a mysterious, almost silent housekeeper.
        Being afraid of the dark, and of other "phenomenoms" including a haunted
        ch√¢teau nearby, she curiously accepts a stranger she finds in her
        mansion's barn. This fact contradicts her fearful nature, but fulfills
        her loneliness. The stranger has run away from a nearby psychiatric
        clinic, where her father was treating the stranger. She hides the
        stranger, protects him, and he becomes her best friend. Is this girl
        searching for true companionship, coming of age, or is she asserting her
        independence for the first time in her short life?</image:caption
