        >The young family who moved to a new apartment on the outskirts of the
        city. The nanny hired by them for the newborn daughter quickly gained
        confidence. However, the older boy, Egor, talks about the frightening
        behavior of a woman, but his parents do not believe him. The
        surveillance cameras installed by the father for comfort only confirm
        everything is in order. Then one day, Egor, returning home, finds no
        trace of either the nanny or the little sister, and the parents are in a
        strange trance and do not even remember that they had a daughter. Then
        Egor, together with his friends, goes in search, during which it turns
        out that the nanny is an ancient Slavic demon, popularly known as Baba
        Yaga.</image:caption
