        >Well-intentioned Marsha and David hire a foreign housekeeper, Sophia,
        to care for their new baby and put some 'sanity' back in their lives.
        What follows is a situation that spirals out of control. In a frenzy to
        find an American husband before her visa expires, Sophia manipulates
        poor Marsha and David into caring for her ten-year-old daughter while
        she goes on a dating marathon. Pretty soon, who is employing whom,
        becomes the question. Also thrown into the mix are Marsha's
        hypochondriac father, Sophia's eccentric Mama and cousin Sasha from the
        Moscow circus.</image:caption
