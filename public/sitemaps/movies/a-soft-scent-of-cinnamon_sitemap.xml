        >Valia is a young woman used to observing others as part of her work,
        and so reality is becoming a canvas where characters live out a kind of
        life. She records the same shot with a small video camera: the street in
        front of her apartment where there is a restaurant. Some days later, she
        meets Guido, the owner of the Italian restaurant. Guido is her
        antithesis, perfectly adapted to daily life and conscious of his own
        social dimension. Valia, on the other hand, lives in this
        two-dimensional world, separated from what is actually happening and
        what she observes. Valia's life changes when she discovers a small lump
        on her breast and she is diagnosed with breast cancer. With Guido, Valia
        recovers her otherness while facing her end.</image:caption
