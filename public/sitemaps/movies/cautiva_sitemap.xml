        >Cristina's life is thrown into turmoil when she is suddenly escorted
        from her strict Catholic school in Buenos Aires and told that she is
        really Sof√≠a Lombardi, the daughter of activists who disappeared in the
        '70s. Questioning everything she once thought true, Cristina embarks on
        a journey to find her true identity. Meeting others like herself, the
        young girl soon discovers the real-life horrors of Argentina's
        relatively recent past and the nightmare that claimed tens of thousands
        of lives during the country's "dirty war."</image:caption
