        >Tina Khanna (Eesha Deol), her friends Riya, and Coco, based in India,
        are invited to a wedding in Bangkok, Thailand. All three travel to
        Bangkok to attend the wedding. There, Tina meets with Vijay Chouhan
        (Zayed Khan), and both fall in love. Then Tina finds out that her Uncle
        Tony has been killed in an accident. She is given his belongings, and is
        thereafter thrust into a nightmare by a gang of people who will not stop
        at anything to get what Tony has left for Tina. She turns to Vijay for
        help, only to find out that he is Prakash Yogi, the brother of a
        criminal who belonged to the same gang as Tony, who were successful in
        robbing an armoured vehicle in India, three years ago. The only person
        who can now help Tina is in the Indian Embassy, Deepak Chopra, but he
        too has an ulterior motive.</image:caption
