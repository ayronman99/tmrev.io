        >On a post-apocalyptic world of never-ending winter, a sparse cast of
        outsiders live underground. Due to their unsanitary conditions, sexual
        contact has become dangerous. Masturbation has become the paradigm of
        sexual experience and an array of low-tech devices with this purpose has
        come into existence. In this bleak reality, Czuperski (a dealer of such
        machines) and Tania (a sex addict) make a deal: she will allow him to
        experiment new devices on her body in exchange of pleasure. Soon
        however, their relationship goes out of control.</image:caption
