        >CHINK is about an Asian American man who has internalized the racism he
        felt as a child and turned it into a hatred of all Asians â€“ including
        himself. His anger and his desire to be like his hero (Ted Bundy) leads
        him to violence and ultimately to his dream of becoming the greatest
        serial killer in history.</image:caption
