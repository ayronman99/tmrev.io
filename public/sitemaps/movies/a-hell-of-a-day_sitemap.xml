        >Some days turn out to be simply unforgettable. For Marie, it all starts
        with a pregnancy testâ€¦ that proves positive, a car accident and being
        fired from her job... For Hortense, mobile phone in hand, the frantic
        quest for sexual satisfaction begins in a traffic jam... For both Luis
        and Maurice, the unexpected appearance of a loved one pitches them into
        a world of dreams and nightmares. While some of the characters know each
        other, others come into contact by chance. One woman profits from all
        this, the other is shattered. One will have gone looking for trouble,
        the other will have asked for nothing. There'll be no
        fatalities.</image:caption
