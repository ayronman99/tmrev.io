        >Set in bureaucratic Lutyens’ Delhi and ancient exotic Jaisalmer, Chai
        Pani etc. is a bittersweet coming of age story, of earnest US returned
        filmmaker, Satya. While subtle intense newbie, Zafar Karachiwala, as the
        idealistic Satya, struggles against official sloth, hypocrisy,
        corruption, and censorship, Konkona Sen ( National Award - Best Actress)
        brilliantly plays the two modern women who battle for his heart: the fun
        loving, ambitious fashion designer Radha and the elegant, sensitive
        Shanti, who works in a charity. Adding to the chaos, is hilarious Sinia
        Duggal as Satya’s pushy aunt, who tries to trap him into a traditional
        marriage and hysterically funny Gaurav Kapur, as Satya’s cynical friend,
        who lives by the perverted rules of networks of power and
        patronage.</image:caption
