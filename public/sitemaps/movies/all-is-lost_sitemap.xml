        >During a solo voyage in the Indian Ocean, a veteran mariner awakes to
        find his vessel taking on water after a collision with a stray shipping
        container. With his radio and navigation equipment disabled, he sails
        unknowingly into a violent storm and barely escapes with his life. With
        any luck, the ocean currents may carry him into a shipping lane -- but,
        with supplies dwindling and the sharks circling, the sailor is forced to
        face his own mortality.</image:caption
