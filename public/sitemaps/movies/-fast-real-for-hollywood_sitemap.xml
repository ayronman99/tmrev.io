        >There's no time for "lights, camera, action" in this game - it's just
        shoot and run! 2Fast2Real brings you bang up to date with the very
        latest street racing antics from America. The name speaks for itself:
        2FAST? - 205 mph on a bike and a 150mph wheelie is way too fast for the
        street! 2REAL? - It's incredible what takes place on public streets:
        cops, tickets and more. FOR HOLLYWOOD? No actor or film director could
        capture the raw drama and thrilling reality of street racing. The film
        is packed with gut-wrenchingly fast racing including a burnout in Time
        Square! There are also police busts galore and lots and lots of
        delicious American honeyz to drool over! It's fast, scary and very
        illegal - you have been warned!</image:caption
