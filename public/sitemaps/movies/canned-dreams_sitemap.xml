        >A simple can of ravioli propels this spectacular 30,000-kilometre,
        eight-country journey through all phases of food production and the far
        flung sources of international ingredients. A dream-like voyage with
        glimpses of disconcerting realities, the story begins with a single
        mother toiling in one of the biggest open pit mines in Brazil and ends
        on the shelf of a grocery store in Finland. Along the way, the workers
        whose calloused hands mine, raise and harvest each ingredient reveal
        their dreams and hopes, like the Danish pig farmer who loves his sows
        but longs for a girlfriend, and the Portuguese tomato picker who wants
        to stay healthy long enough to pay her daughters way through university.
        Sumptuous photography and impressive sound design make an eloquent
        statement about our modern, globalized world, making us aware of the
        hundreds of invisible people who prepare the food we eat every day.
