        >Djeneba is a mother of nine children living in Kadioloko, southern
        Mali. Since her husband left the family some years ago Djeneba and her
        children manage the family’s millet fields without him. Recently the
        eldest boy, Madou, has brought his new wife, Lidy, into the family
        group. In this film we explore daily life in the compound as Djeneba
        assumes full responsibility for her family’s needs. Filmmaker, Bata
        Diallo, herself a Malian, engages Djeneba’s life-world in observational
        style and by way of intimate conversations. As well as the family we
        meet Nono, the old chief of Kadioloko. He’s a good friend of Djeneba and
        a renowned local philosopher with a wry world-view and a sense of humour
        to match. Djeneba and her family are from the agriculturalist Minyaka
        ethnic group but we also get to know some Fulani pastoralists who share
        the village of Kadioloko. “Djeneba” is an hour-long chronicle of
        quotidian life in rural Mali from a woman’s point of
        view.</image:caption
