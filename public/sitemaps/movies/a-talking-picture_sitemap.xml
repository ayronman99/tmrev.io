        >A meditation on civilization. July, 2001: friends wave as a cruise ship
        departs Lisbon for Mediterranean ports and the Indian Ocean. On board
        and on day trips in Marseilles, Pompeii, Athens, Istanbul, and Cairo, a
        professor tells her young daughter about myth, history, religion, and
        wars. Men approach her; she's cool, on her way to her husband in Bombay.
        After Cairo, for two evenings divided by a stop in Aden, the captain
        charms three successful, famous (and childless) women, who talk with wit
        and intellect, each understanding the others' native tongue, a European
        union. The captain asks mother and child to join them. He gives the girl
        a gift. Helena sings. Life can be sweet.</image:caption
