        >"A Man Called Jon" is a light-hearted dramedy about Pastor Jon Terrell
        Carson's unusual style of worship. Jon's church is very traditional and
        is not accustomed to outbursts during service. One day after
        embarrassing the church along with his family, Senior Pastor Stannum
        decides to reach out to the Bishop requesting that Jon be assigned to a
        church more suited to his style of praise. Jon and his family find
        themselves at an African American Church, where he is confronted by
        Associate Pastor Dickens, who later informs him that he was sent to the
        wrong church due to mix-up in paperwork. Jon is moved to his third
        church where he struggles to fit in. Will Jon be able to control his
        celebration or will he be moved for a fourth time?</image:caption
