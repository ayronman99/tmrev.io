        >Ludwig Von Beethoven continued composing and playing music after going
        completely deaf, but that's just one fascinating fact about one of the
        greatest classical composers of all time. This biography explores the
        man's life. Highlighted are his romantic failures and his courtroom
        battle to prove his noble lineage. Scholars and musicians comment on his
        character, talent and legacy, and world-class orchestras perform the
        composer's works.</image:caption
