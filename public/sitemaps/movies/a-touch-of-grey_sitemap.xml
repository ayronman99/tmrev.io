        >Barb has the perfect life, or so she's been told. Somewhere down the
        road, she's gained a husband, kids and a career, but lost her freedom
        and passion for life. In an attempt to recapture the innocence of her
        carefree days, Barb calls her high school pals Patti, Karen and Liz
        together for a weekend reunion. Loosening up with a few bottles of wine,
        each shares their secrets and dreams. But they soon discover that they
        share much more - burden, responsibility and a deep dissatisfaction for
        where their decisions have taken them. The best friends reach out to one
        another for collective wisdom and guidance. But, is it enough to save
        these four friends and set them back on their chosen paths? A Touch of
        Grey is a bittersweet comedy. A poignant, soul-searching journey that
        explores the question, can we have it all and still be truly
        happy?</image:caption
