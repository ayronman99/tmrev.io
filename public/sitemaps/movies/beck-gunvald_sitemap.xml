        >An investigative journalist is found beaten to death in his home, where
        the fingerprints of a notorious criminal debt collector are also found.
        The murdered journalist has been threatened by right wing extremists,
        but it is the victim’s work with a book about “society’s dark side” that
        captures the Beck group’s interest. When the case takes an unexpected
        and terrible turn, there is suddenly much more at stake than finding the
        journalist’s killer. Martin Beck and his colleagues have never had to
        protect the balance of their professional and private lives with the
        same tenacity as they do now.</image:caption
