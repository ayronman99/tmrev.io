        >It's 1994 in Mexico, the nation was witnessing a turbulent year since
        its beginnings. An indigenous rebellion shakes the country. Three months
        later, the ruling party's presidential candidate is brutally murdered
        during a rally in Tijuana. The country is concerned. Nobody knows who's
        behind this event, it all points to a conspiracy. Andrés Vázquez, an
        intelligence expert, is commissioned to lead a secret investigation
        parallel to the official government issued one. But another expert
        agent, el Seco, has received orders to wipe out all witnesses and get
        rid of the evidence surrounding the candidate's murder. As Andrés begins
        putting the pieces of this intricate puzzle together and comes closer to
        the truth, he realizes he's also putting his life and that of his loved
        ones in peril.</image:caption
