        health makes him realise he wants to make amends. The more he tries to
        do right, the more he does wrong, and as his past comes back to haunt
        him, he is forced to face up to what his life means to him. Rounding Up
        Donkeys is the second film in Sigma and Zentropa's three feature film
        concept 'Advance Party'.</image:caption
