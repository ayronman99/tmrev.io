        >This film tells about the most striking and tragic phenomenon during
        the development of self-awareness of the Latvian nation – the Latvian
        Riflemen. The first Daugavgrīva regiment, the second Riga, third
        Kurland, fifth Semigallian, sixth Tukums, seventh Bauska and eighth
        Valmiera regiments of Latvian Riflemen – this was Latvia before its
        statehood. The film is a historically chronological study beginning with
        the formation of the Riflemen battalions and their first battles until
        the end of the Civil War in Russia, when a large part of the Riflemen
        returned home to the recently established state of Latvia. This is a
        story about common people challenged by the Big Epoch that determined
        their lives.</image:caption
