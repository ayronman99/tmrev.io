        >In Knohult things havn't changed much. Eulalia is tired of Nisse who's
        engaged in all sorts of inventions in his workshop or poaching in the
        forest rather than to repair the water pump. When Eulalia in protest
        begins swimming in soft drinks and water the plants with spirit
        Åsa-Nisse sees nothing else to do but to repair the pump. As with all
        his inventions he adds a few extra features ... When he starts the
        machine the ground rumbles and up comes oil instead of water! Now, not
        only Åsa-Nisse, but the whole Knohult sees their chance to become
        wealthy! But "Dunderpumpen", as he calles the invention, turns out to be
        stronger than anyone had imagined, and when shady Scanian oil magnates
        with support of the Swedish government wants their share of the pie
        Knohult declares themselves a republic...</image:caption
