        >DEAD TEENAGER MOVIE is a short-format documentary examining a specific
        sub-genre of teen slasher films; namely the Dead Teenager Movie - a term
        coined by movie critic, Roger Ebert. Through the use of interviews with
        cultural professors, film historians, directors, writers, producers and
        film critics, and with visual aids from movie clips of several dead teen
        horror films, the documentary explores the origins of these stories from
        their beginnings in urban legends to their jump to the big screen in the
        late 70s to their modern incarnations (like FINAL DESTINATION 3 and its
        two predecessors). It look sat what clich√©s and stereotypes define the
        sub-genre, and how they have developed in cinema over time, particularly
        finding a home at New Line Cinema.</image:caption
