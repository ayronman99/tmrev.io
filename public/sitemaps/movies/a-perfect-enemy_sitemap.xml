        >Successful architect Jeremy Angust is approached on his trip to the
        Tokyo International Airport by a chatty girl called Texel Textor. She is
        a strange young woman who seems to be looking for captive victims whom
        she forces to listen to her strange stories. Jeremy loses the flight
        because of Texel and once they are installed in the lounge area, he will
        not be able to get rid of the annoying stranger. Although the meeting
        seems fortuitous, soon there be a turn that will transform the character
        of that encounter into something much more sinister and
        criminal.</image:caption
