        >Cocada and Nego are two boys in their early teens living in a small
        town in Pernambouc, Brazil. Cocada and Nego are half-brothers who live
        with their mother, stepfather and eight other siblings in a ramshackle
        house where the children are often left to care for themselves as their
        parents work. Filmmakers Jean-Pierre Duret and Andréa Santana spent some
        time with Cocada and Nego, and Puisque nous sommes nés is a documentary
        that offers a look at their lives as they struggle with poverty and
        dream of a happier future.</image:caption
