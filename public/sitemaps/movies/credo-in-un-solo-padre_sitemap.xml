        >Falcino, a small town in the south of Italy. No one sees. No one hears.
        Nobody talks. But everyone knows. And so they all become accomplices of
        a tragedy against women, against kids, against a family. A story of
        violence and slavery. Indifference is stronger than their conscience.
        Maria, a young mother of a family, lives with her husband Gerardo and
        her two children, Rocco e Carmela, on her father-in-law's farm:
        "grandp√†" Giuseppe. Gerardo decides to emigrate to Austria to earn more
        money so as to allow a more comfortable life for the family. This
        absence will be the beginning of a nightmare that will lead Maria and
        her daughter to be victims of abuse of an unscrupulous ogre
        (monster).</image:caption
