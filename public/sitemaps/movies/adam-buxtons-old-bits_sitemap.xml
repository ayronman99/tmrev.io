        >Here's a brand new show from Adam that we recorded in the BFI in London
        earlier in the year. It's hilarious. It was one of those nights where we
        had such a good time we couldn't wait to share it with you all. The show
        was a best-of compilation of Adam's favourite routines from the past few
        years. In it, he talks about real life struggles that we can all relate
        to - working from home whilst trying to avoid the internet. Luckily for
        us he doesn't manage to keep away from it for too long, as we get to see
        his search history looking at the work of some beloved performers
        together with the views of the YouTube commentary community. When
        relaxing away from the internet we are also treated to a selection of
        videos that Adam has made that give a pretty good insight into his home
        life. He even says 'my wife' in a robot voice.</image:caption
