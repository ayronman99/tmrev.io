        >The film begins with the Shinkengers defeating the Ayakashi Demebakuto.
        As he assumes his second life, he captures the Shinkengers in mirrors as
        he sends them into a series of different dimensions (all different film
        genres) in order make them suffer for his amusement before actually
        killing them. First, the Shinkengers appear in the jidaigeki Lord's log
        of Notable Events, fighting a group of samurai, shortly followed by a
        Western showdown between Genta and Ginshir≈ç, the owner of the rival
        sushi stand Silver Zushi, over whose food is better in Wild Grip. Then
        the scene changes again to the cop drama Passionate Version with the
        vassals as cops while Takeru is being held hostage as the Shinkengers
        starts to realize that something is wrong.</image:caption
