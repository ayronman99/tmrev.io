        >While planning the eventual DVD release for "1991: The Year Punk
        Broke", Dave Markey cut a 40-minute film out of unused footage to create
        a companion piece to include. The film was also shown to a handful of
        lucky audiences before the DVD's eventual release in 2011. It's an
        awesome bonus with tons of great footage that could have easily been in
        the film. These songs were probably the best to leave out of the
        full-length film, since 2 were brand new and still quite shaky. The only
        tour staple not accounted for in either film is "Mary-Christ". Here are
        the sources I could determine: Inhuman - ?? White Kross - 08/27/91
        Bremen Orange Rolls, Angel's Spit - 08/24/91 Koln In Bloom (Nirvana) -
        09/01/91 Rotterdam Eric's Trip - 09/01/91 Rotterdam (but spoken intro is
        from 08/25/91?) Tunic snippet - 08/27/91 Bremen Chapel Hill - 08/27/91
