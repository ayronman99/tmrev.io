        >The film tells the story of a ruthless landowner who commandeers
        property (both land and other men's wives) and leaves a path of human
        suffering and death in his wake. The film describes an intersecting
        universe of entrenched power--in which the landowning class, colluding
        priests, corrupt government officials, violent police, and U.S.
        businessmen--conspiring to rape the land for their own profit and to
        suppress the local farmers. In contrast, the working peasants cherish
        the land as their own and struggle to break free from oppression to
        build homes and better lives for their families.</image:caption
