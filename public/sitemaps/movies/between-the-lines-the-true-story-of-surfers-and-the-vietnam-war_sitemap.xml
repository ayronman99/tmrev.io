        >BETWEEN THE LINES explores the Vietnam War through the prism of the
        surfing sub-culture. The film looks at the dramatic effect that the
        Vietnam War and draft had on young American men who rode waves. Narrated
        by John Milius, Between the Lines explores the choice that most draft
        age surfers faced during the Vietnam War era: either go to war or evade
        the draft. It was one or the other. Between the Lines delves into the
        lives of two surfers who choose opposite paths. Pat Farley and Brant
        Page. While following the lives of these two surfers the film chronicles
        the impact of the Vietnam War on the surfing lifestyle. From the
        peaceful shores of Hawaii to the canopy jungles of Vietnam, Between the
        Lines excavates the surfing cultures response to an extraordinary
        circumstance.</image:caption
