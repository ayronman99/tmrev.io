        >Way down the island country side, “Behind God’s Back” as the locals
        call it; Tired of monotonous village life, Skimma dreams of just seeing
        something different. But after receiving the news that he has gotten
        Rebecca pregnant, and his constant complaints about his small village;
        he embraces a new profession: the village pot supplier. It quickly
        becomes evident that everyone wants what he's selling -- even local
        Rastaman Oiris — Skimma is faced with making some money to provide for
        his new child and keeping his new enterprise out of the reach of the
        law.</image:caption
