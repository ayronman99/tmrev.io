        >The Essential Alison Moyet was essentially a third re-release of
        Singles, the 1995 greatest hits album of recordings by singer/songwriter
        Alison Moyet. The album was released in 2001 by Sony Music Entertainment
        in response to renewed interest in the singer, after she was finally
        released from her contract with the label and able to sign with
        Sanctuary Records, regain the artistic control of her musical output and
        move back into the public eye - resulting in 2002 comeback album
        Hometime. However, there are some differences in the track listings of
        the two Sony compilations. The Essential Alison Moyet excludes "Only
        You", "Situation', "Ordinary Girl", "Ode To Boy II", "The First Time
        Ever I Saw Your Face" and "Solid Wood", and replaces them with "Don't
        Go", "Winter Kills", "Our Colander Eyes" and "Blue" (the latter two
        recorded in 1995/1996) plus cover versions "Ne Me Quitte Pas" and "There
        Are Worse Things I Could Do".</image:caption
