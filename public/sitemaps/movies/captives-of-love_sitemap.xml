        >On "Planet T," an Elder is teaching a young girl that she has
        contracted a virus called "love." She must go to Earth to experience
        human love and understand its illusion before her soul can recover. The
        Elder also tells the woman that the first man she sees on Earth will be
        her lover. On Earth, at a solo concert by the famous singer Amy, an
        admirer, Qin Liang, is waiting outside the door, eager to see the idol.
        A beam of light lands on Amy's poster -- and the woman from Planet T
        appears as Amy. She goes home with Qin Liang, tells him her origin, and
        says she loves him and hopes to be his wife. Qin Liang regards her as
        crazy, but she's determined not to leave him.</image:caption
