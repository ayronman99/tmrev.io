        >Alexander 'Sasha' Shulgin is the scientist behind more than 200
        psychedelic compounds including MDMA, more commonly known as Esctasy.
        Considered to be one of the the greatest chemists of the twentieth
        century, Sasha's vast array of discoveries have had a profound impact in
        the field of psychedelic research. 'Dirty Pictures' delves into the
        lifework of Dr. Shulgin and scientists alike, explores the world of
        these scientists; their findings and motivations, their ideas, and their
        beliefs as to how research in this particular field can aid in unlocking
        the complexities of the mind.</image:caption
