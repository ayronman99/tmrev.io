        >"Danielson: a Family movie" is a documentary about unbridled creativity
        vs. accessibility, Christian faith vs. popular culture, underground
        music vs. survival, and family vs. individuality. The film follows
        Daniel Smith, an eccentric musician and visual artist, as he leads his
        four siblings and best friend to indie rock stardom, eventually facing
        the struggle to become viable as a solo act. Along the way he mentors an
        unknown singer-songwriter named Sufjan Stevens whose own subsequent
        success stands in stark contrast to the music world's uneasy reception
        of Danielson just a few years prior. Makes use of collage, direct cinema
        and animation. Written by Creative Arson</image:caption
