        >It is an unwelcome homecoming for Siva, a Singaporean-Indian
        ex-convict, haunted by a tragedy in his past. Released after eight years
        behind bars and dejected by his mother’s coldness, he leaves home in
        search of his ex-wife and daughter. His old friend denies any knowledge
        of their whereabouts and instead leads him back into crime. Finding him
        sheltering in ‘void decks’ (the open public access corridors found
        beneath government-built residential housing in Singapore), the police
        force him to meet with a social worker; a woman also dealing with her
        own fears.</image:caption
