        >On November 25th 1970, a man committed ritual suicide inside the Tokyo
        headquarters of the Japanese Ministry of Defence, leaving behind a
        legacy of masterpieces and a controversy that echoes to this day. The
        man was Yukio Mishima, one of Japan's greatest and most celebrated
        novelists. With four members of his own private army - the Tatenokai -
        Mishima had taken the commandant hostage and called upon the assembled
        military outside the Ministry to overthrow their society and restore the
        powers of the Emperor. When the soldiers mocked and jeered Mishima, he
        cut short his speech and withdrew to the commandant's office where he
        committed seppuku - the samurai warrior's death - tearing open his belly
        with a ceremonial knife before being beheaded by one of his colleagues.
        What was Mishima truly trying to express through his actions? And what
        did he witness during his final moments?</image:caption
