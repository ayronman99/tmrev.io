        >Former criminal investigator, Major Korenev, nicknamed Fox is released
        from prison. He has been detained there as a result of planted
        incriminating evidence of unlawful investigation techniques. Setting
        accounts with Shaman - a big criminal boss, who ordered the evidence
        planted and also with his former colleagues was not a part of Korenev's
        agenda. As he returns to Moscow he finds a new world ruled by underworld
        bosses, criminal clans fighting each other and utter chaos on the
        desperately keeping appearances streets of Russian capital. Facing death
        of his friends, Major Korenev decides to re-install law and order using
        some unorthodox methods that are only relevant in 21st century
        Russia.</image:caption
