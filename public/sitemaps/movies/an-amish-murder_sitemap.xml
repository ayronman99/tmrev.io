        >The Amish farming community of Painter’s Mill, Ohio, is shattered when
        a series of brutal murders leaves the town with a sense of frailty and
        loss of innocence. Among the most affected by the tragedy was Kate
        Burkholder, a young girl who survived the terror and, as a result, left
        the Amish life behind. Fifteen years later, Kate returns to Painter’s
        Mill as its Chief of Police. Certain she’s come to terms with her past,
        Kate’s renewed life in her hometown is shattered when a murder
        investigation triggers deep-seated emotions from her childhood and
        exposes a dark secret that could destroy her.</image:caption
