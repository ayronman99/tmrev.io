        >In Bucharest on a winter’s morning, a couple make love. Adina wants to
        move in with her boyfriend Radu as soon as possible. He, on the other
        hand, is slightly more reluctant but appears to simply tolerate her
        plans. Today is New Year’s Eve and Radu and Adina have a lot to do: the
        two have planned a visit to Adina’s parents followed by a party with
        friends. While buying last-minute gifts at the supermarket, Radu thinks
        he spots ex-girlfriend Nadja, who he has never forgotten. In one small
        moment, Radu’s insecurities about Adina come bubbling to the surface. No
        sooner have the corks begin to pop, the relationship comes to an abrupt
        end. This is followed by the perfectly timed offer from Radu’s friend
        Alex to hit the town with him and his friends. Radu accepts the offer in
        the hope that Nadja is also out. Director Paul Negogescu draws a
        portrait of Radu with precision and subtle irony – and captures the
        atmosphere of a New Year’s evening with great
        authenticity.</image:caption
