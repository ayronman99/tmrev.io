        >Michael Jackson is a legend in the world of craft brewing. His 1977
        book, The World Guide to Beer, was the first of its kind, and the first
        to categorize almost every major style of beer in the world. His 1993
        television series, The Beer Hunter, became an instant classic, and
        helped launch the spectacular craft beer movement that we take for
        granted today. Michael's engaging writing literally saved many styles of
        beer from extinction, and his work inspired an entire generation of
        brewers to experiment with beer styles from around the world. Many in
        the beer world are unaware that Michael was also the leading author on
        the subject of whiskey, and his books on whiskey have sold more copies
        worldwide than his books on beer. His sudden death in 2007, at the age
        of 65, shocked the beer and whiskey worlds. His legacy and contributions
        were substantial, and should be recognized and remembered. As a person,
        Michael was one of the best, as those fortunate enough to know him can
        attest to.</image:caption
