        >Traces the long and ferocious rivalry between Coke and Pepsi, centered
        on the "New Coke" debacle of 1985. For almost a hundred years, Coke had
        been the undisputed leader in the multibillion dollar global soda
        industry--stodgy, predictable, but indisputably top dog--while Pepsi had
        been the upstart No. 2, forever poking at its big brother with cutting
        edge advertising. But in 1985, in a stranger-than-fiction twist,
        Coca-Cola's executives took a step so daring that no one in either
        company could believe it: they changed the formula of the most popular
        beverage on the planet.</image:caption
