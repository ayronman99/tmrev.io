        >Fifty years of war between the Great Eastern Federation and Europa -
        now merged as Eurasia - have taken their toll on planet Earth. As a
        result of the use of biological, chemical and nuclear weapons, much of
        Earth has become uninhabitable and people have become prey to new
        diseases. Professor Azuma's "neo-cell" project, which is supposed to be
        the answer to mankind's hardships, becomes a nightmare come true when
        mutants spawned from the experiment escape and declare war on the human
        race. Azuma's son Tetsuya, who was killed during the previous war, is
        reborn into the cyborg Casshern as mankind's last hope against the new
        mutant threat. This live-action sci-fi movie based on a 1973 Japanese
        anim√© of the same name.</image:caption
