        >Disinfo.Con contains an amazing 4 hours of footage from The
        Disinformation Company's massive counterculture event in New York City's
        Hammerstein Ballroom. New York hadn't seen anything like this since the
        Nova Convention in 1978 which saw Frank Zappa, Patti Smith and others
        anoint William Burroughs as king of the counterculture. A quarter
        century later Disinformation's keynote speakers Richard Metzger and
        Douglas Rushkoff ushered in a dizzying, day-long array of performances
        ranging from sword-swallowing to sanskrit chanting, interspersed with
        lectures and conversations with counterculture luminaries like Mondo
        2000 founder R.U. Sirius, industrial music progenitor Genesis P-Orridge,
        Grant Morrison, Robert Anton Wilson, theorists, performance artists and
        others from the extremes of popular culture. Nothing beats actually
        experiencing an event like this in the flesh, but this DVD comes pretty
        close to capturing the spirit of the counterculture as we lurch into the
        21st century.</image:caption
