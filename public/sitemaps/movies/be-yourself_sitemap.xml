        >Yasushi and Yuka, who have both lost their spouses in the past, are
        brought together by fate and lead a happy life together, blessed with
        two children. Then one day, their new house, which the couple had
        painstakingly built together, catches fire due to Yuka's carelessness.
        Fortunately, no one in the family is seriously injured and Yasushi is
        relieved, but the shock of the fire causes Yuka to suffer from a
        neurological disorder called dissociative amnesia, and she is unable to
        remember even her own name. The doctor tells her that there is no clear
        cure in modern medicine, which shocks Yasushi, but she accepts Yuka in
        her current state and decides to walk with her again.</image:caption
