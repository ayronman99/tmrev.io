        >Shana, a-19-year-old, has 24-carat diamond implants in her teeth. She
        lives with her cousin, Vantje, while studying in Sydney. Vantje feels
        that he has to find Shana her perfect partner. So he pairs her off to
        Jacky. They get along well, but then Jacky has to go back to Jakarta, so
        they start to miss each other. It turns out that Jacky's return to
        Jakarta is prompted by his brother's illness. So he has to work to earn
        money to cover the medical expenses. Shana then sells her diamond teeth
        to cover for Jacky's brotherâ€™s surgery.</image:caption
