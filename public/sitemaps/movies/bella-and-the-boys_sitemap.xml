        >13 years after Bella, Martin and Lee were there, the manager of their
        children's home is retiring and the home being shutdown. As they meet up
        together at a reunion/retirement celebration it sparks old memories of
        their time together at the home. Both Martin and Lee fancy Bella and
        their relationship are very involved. The reunion brings back memories
        of their youth as well as truths about what has happened
        since.</image:caption
