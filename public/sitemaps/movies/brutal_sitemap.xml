        >BRUTAL centers on Trevor (Morgan Benoit), abducted from his backyard at
        the age of fifteen by an unseen alien presence. Forced into nearly two
        decades of no-holds-barred fights against other abductees inside an
        unearthly mixed martial arts arena, Trevor has evolved from an innocent
        boy into a brutal fighting machine. Derek, (Jeff Hatch) an ambulance
        chasing lawyer, is the latest lab-rat abductee forced to fight Trevor.
        As the two men exchange ever-increasing beating over the course of weeks
        and months, the brutality of their existence and the true nature of
        their humanity is slowly revealed. With elements of THE TWILIGHT ZONE
        and THE PRISONER, BRUTAL explores through science fiction, allegory and
        psychological drama, manâ€™s violent nature and our propensity to commit
        unthinkable acts of violence against each other. Yet through this prism
        of brutality our capacity to love one another, even in the worst of
        circumstances is celebrated.</image:caption
