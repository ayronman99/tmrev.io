        >Sawa, a home helper for a middle class family with an elderly infirm
        grandfather, is forced to stretch her morals to keep her job. As a
        result, she finds herself broke and out on the street. She survives her
        first night by striking up an ambiguous friendship with a kindly old
        man, gaining access to a portion of the immense wealth held by Japan's
        aging population. She continues with similar encounters, and while these
        begin as scams or revenge on rampant sexism, they ultimately become
        vulnerable intergenerational exchanges.</image:caption
