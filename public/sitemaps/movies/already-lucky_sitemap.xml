        >Ian Murphy can't find a job. Layla is facing harassment at her job. At
        home, the two of them can't seem to connect anymore. After one faithful
        night, she walks out on him leaving him distraught, angry, and self
        loathing. Through some cosmic shift, he meets Evelyn, who is impossibly
        positive and helps make life seem bearable for him again.</image:caption
