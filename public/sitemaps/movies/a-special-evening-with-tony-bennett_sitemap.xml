        >This extraordinary performance captures Tony Bennett singing some of
        his greatest hits as he celebrates his 25th anniversary as a cabaret
        singer. Recorded at the renowned Bottom Line Cabaret in New York's
        Greenwich Village, Tony is in his favorite element, backed by his
        favorite group, the Ralph Sharon Trio. In addition to his megahit "I
        Left My Heart in San Francisco," Tony performs American music classics
        by such great lyricists and composers as Richard Rodgers, George
        Gershwin, Cole Porter, and Duke Ellington. The camera work and live
        recording capture the intimate feeling of being at a ringside table--the
        quintessential way to enjoy the magic of Tony Bennett. Now you can watch
        the master performing songs that, like Tony himself, will live forever
        in your heart.</image:caption
