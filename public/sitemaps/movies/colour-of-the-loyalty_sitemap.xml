        >As befits a full-blooded Jiang Hu (underworld) antic, COTL takes place
        over the course of a short, frenetic period, feeling to all intents and
        purposes like one night. It encompasses plenty of gore and cadavers
        (unless you get the sanitized, inferior mainland version), relying to a
        large extent on so-called triad codes of honor and organizational
        culture. At its core resides old boss Dragon Brother, done by Eric Tsang
        in a repast from his barrage of comical roles and commercial
        endorsements. The head wants to retire, leading to chaos in gangland as
        everybody else desires his position and accumulated fortune. Following
        his fateful announcement, two rival Mafioso's become potential enemies
        as Dragon Brother and concubine (Suki Kwan) aim to leave Hong Kong in
        order to start a new life in Europe.</image:caption
