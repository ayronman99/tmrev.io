        >For Shirin, being part of a perfect Persian family isn't easy.
        Acceptance eludes her from all sides: her family doesn't know she's
        bisexual, and her ex-girlfriend, Maxine, can't understand why she
        doesn't tell them. Even the six-year-old boys in her moviemaking class
        are too ADD to focus on her for more than a second. Following a family
        announcement of her brother's betrothal to a parentally approved Iranian
        prize catch, Shirin embarks on a private rebellion involving a series of
        bisexual escapades, while trying to decipher what went wrong with
        Maxine.</image:caption
