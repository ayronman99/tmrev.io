        >When Aaron, an ex-fighter, turns to music after years of being knocked
        around and left with permanent mental disabilities, he falls for Jana,
        an off-centered Bulgarian immigrant living in New York. While he
        recognizes that she is as crazy as he is, Jana does not share the same
        opinion. But her brother, Bobby, an up and coming wannabe fighter,
        decides to convince her she is that crazy in order to get Aaron in the
        ring against him.</image:caption
