        >"Do you have the Shine?" is a film version of the game with the same
        name. The setting for the film is inspired by the hotel in Stanley
        Kubrick's film,"The Shining". The viewer sees the deserted hotel
        corridors through the eyes of a boy on a tricycle. In spite of the
        non-interactive nature of the medium, the film is built up like the
        video game it is based upon. Through the rules presented in the intro
        and the rolling pointmarks, the viewer is inscribed with the notion that
        they are able to determine the course of the film. Corner after corner
        are passed with the uncomfortable, anxious feeling that decades of
        horror film have imprinted in all of us.</image:caption
