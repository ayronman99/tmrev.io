        >Organized crime syndicates are deeply entrenched in Japanese history.
        Known as the Jakuza, they were once seen as gangsters with strict code
        of honor, helping the police to fight the criminal underworld. The
        Yakuza in Japan has links that extend as far back as 400 years to Edo
        era. But their days of protecting the weak against the strong are long
        gone. Today, the Yakuza is a criminal network with nearly 80,000 members
        operating in 22 crime syndicates, and raking in billions of dollars a
        year. And Japan's law enforcement wants to wipe them out once and for
        all. With their links to drug and prostitution rings, corporate crimes
        and deadly shootings, Japanese officials want choke the Yakuza's
        existence by starving them financially.</image:caption
