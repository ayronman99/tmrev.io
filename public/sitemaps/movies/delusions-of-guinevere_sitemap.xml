        >Former child star, Guinevere James, is 29, overweight and washed up.
        She spends night after lonely night on social media sites like Facebook,
        in a vain attempt to make her life bigger than it seems. She also spends
        time “FaceStalking” her former co-star, Cadence Stone, who has blossomed
        into a modelesque A-lister at the top of the game. When Guinevere
        receives an invitation to a 20th-anniversary special for her signature
        Gelee commercials, she heads to the event ready for her big comeback
        only to have her hopes dashed when no one shows up.</image:caption
