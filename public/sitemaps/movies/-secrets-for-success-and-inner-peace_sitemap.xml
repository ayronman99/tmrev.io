        >Bestselling author and lecturer Wayne W. Dyer has created this film,
        based on his thought-provoking book, for those of us who have chosen to
        consciously be on our life path. The ten “secrets” for success and inner
        peace presented here apply whether you’re just embarking on your path,
        are nearing the end of it, or are on the path in any way. Dr. Dyer urges
        you to view with an open heart. By doing so, you’ll learn to feel the
        peace of God that truly defines success. Dr. Dyer shares his view that
        we’re living in an age of spiritual deficiency. We have more than enough
        information in our society — it’s spirituality that’s
        lacking.</image:caption
