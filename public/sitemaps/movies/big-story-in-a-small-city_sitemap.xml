        his friends and family before the burial. The family, consumed with
        grief fails to realize that the body on the dining room table is not
        Grigor. A friend of the family, while paying respects, discovers the
        mistake. Grigors look-a-like, Ruben Pashayan was the head of Armenia's
        organized crime families. Trouble is inevitable, but as the story
