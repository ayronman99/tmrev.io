        >When the groom's oldest friend, Cole, (Jack Quaid) finds out his best
        friend, Jason, (Jared Wernick) is getting married, he escapes from the
        institution he has been incarcerated in and makes a surprise visit to
        serve as the best man. Something does not seem right between bride,
        Gretchen, (Justine Magnusson) and groom. None of their friends seem to
        fully support the marriage and have secrets of their own. Unresolved
        about their relationship and endlessly obsessed with the groom, Cole
        stirs up everyone and everything, making it a weekend to
        remember.</image:caption
