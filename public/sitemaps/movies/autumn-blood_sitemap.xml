        >Two young orphans in the Tirolian Mountains come under siege by a
        vicious band of hunters. Frightened of being separated by child services
        following the death of their mother, a self-sufficient 16-year-old girl
        and her 10-year-old brother - who hasn't spoken a word since seeing his
        father killed by the mayor - strive to live off the land in peace. Their
        innocence is shattered, however, when a group of hunters led by the
        mayor's son brutalizes and rapes the free-spirited girl. Later, when a
        well-meaning social services worker arrives too late to protect the
        terrorized siblings, the girl and her brother prepare to take a stand
        against their ruthless attackers.</image:caption
