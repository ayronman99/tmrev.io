        >The unexpected and gruesome death of a student threatens the existence
        of an old Catholic school for girls. Pat Consolacion, the school
        guidance counselor, involves herself with the students in the hopes of
        helping them cope, and at the same time uncover the mysteries of the
        student’s death. Most students suspect of the strict and borderline
        abusive Mother Alice, who also threatened Pat’s tenure in the school
        because of her continuous meddling with the case. But Pat’s unusual
        talents lead her to knowing Eri, a former student who's been watching
        the whole school for years. Piece by piece, Pat uncovers the secret of
        the school and the monster that it nurtured for the past
        century.</image:caption
