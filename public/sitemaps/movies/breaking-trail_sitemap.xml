        >Last season Utah’s Wasatch Mountains and most of North America
        experienced a record breaking doozie, making our never ending mission to
        flatten as many snowflakes as possible almost easy. We estimate the
        number of crystals crushed to be somewhere in the trillions. If you’ve
        had the extreme pleasure of viewing one of our previous films, then the
        obscenedisplay of exploding snow will be nothing new. On closer
        inspection you will notice that Powderwhore is no longer focusing
        primarily on the telemark turn. BREAKING TRAIL will highlight riders of
        all disciplines choosing their own backcountry adventures. Warning!
        There are no shots of helicopters filming other helicopters or
        hankie-clad 16-year-olds hepped up on energy drinks spinning to rap
        music. And you won’t win a Jeep if you come out to a premiere. You will
        find a mixed bag of highly talented and dedicated individuals who enjoy
        hiking out into the unknown in search of turns and
        adventure.</image:caption
