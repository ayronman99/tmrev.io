        >He may be the most underrated rap star and producer in the world. He is
        a pioneer of urban music, beginning his career in the streets of Compton
        and responsible for the sale of over 85 million records worldwide. Never
        before has DJ Quik allowed access into his personal and professional
        life... until now. Go behind the scenes with all access footage,
        including Quik's personal home videos, tour footage, studio and much
        more, along with such hits as "Born and Raised in Compton," "Tonight,"
        "Trouble" and many more. Go step by step through his personal creative
        process, allowing fans access into his signature style, along with
        appearances by Suga Free, Hi-C, Nate Dogg, El Debarge, Butch Cassidy,
        Chuckey, and a moving tribute to Mausberg.</image:caption
