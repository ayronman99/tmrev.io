        >A group of young men dare a classmate to reach the porch of a legendary
        old house, said to be haunted by the thirteen victims of a family
        massacre. In hopes of making a viral video they arm him with a video
        camera to prove he was there or to capture him fleeing in terror before
        even reaching the house, as others have. When he doesn't return, the
        guys must go in to get him. Inside they discover the truth about the
        house, the fate of their friend and their own fate as
        well.</image:caption
