        >Soo-hyun (SHIN Hye-sun), who has recently moved into a new house, buys
        a used washing machine through a second-hand app but finds out it
        doesn’t work. Annoyed by the seller’s irresponsibility, she leaves a
        comment calling the seller a con man, and reports it to the police.
        Little does she know that the seller is a psychopathic serial killer who
        uses an online second-hand market to lure his victims. Her comment
        renders his hunt for a new victim all but impossible so she becomes his
        next target. She starts receiving obscene phone calls, countless
        unwanted food deliveries, and strange men knocking on her door looking
        for a good time. A trip to the sender’s address proves deadly serious
        when the police and Soo-hyun find a woman’s dead body.</image:caption
