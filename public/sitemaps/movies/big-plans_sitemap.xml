        massive fondness for music. Though he's 38 years of age he will not give
        up his lifelong dream of becoming a famous musician. When he gets
        paroled he therefore decides to revive his old band to prove to his
        eight-year-old son, Mikkel, that he isn't the failure everyone thinks he
        is.</image:caption
