        >An adaptation of the eponymous song by Renato Russo, a famous Brazilian
        singer and composer who in the style of Bob Dylan knew how to delight
        crowds by telling stories and singing with his lyrics. Focusing on the
        love story of outlaw João do Santo Cristo with Architecture major
        student Maria Lúcia, the movie takes place in Brasilia in the early 80s.
        In a clash of interest, drug dealers and the police conflict with one
        another,while the end of the military dictatorship in the Capital of
        Brazil, Brasilia takes place. The wanderings and tedium of a young
        rocker, who lived in a city still being built, are the backdrop for this
        story.</image:caption
