        >The Democratic Republic of Congo has endured 20 years of devastating
        violence. Rape has been used as a weapon of war to destroy community and
        access precious minerals. Congo is often referred to as “the worst place
        in the world to be a woman.” "City of Joy" tells a different story of
        the region. The film focuses on Jane, a student at a center where women
        who have suffered unimaginable abuse join together to become leaders. We
        also meet the founders of the center: a devout Congolese Doctor, a
        Congolese activist, and a radical N.Y. playwright. The film weaves
        between joy and pain as these individuals band together to demand hope
        in a place so often deemed hopeless.</image:caption
