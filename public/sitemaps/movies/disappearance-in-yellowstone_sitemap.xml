        >When Jessie’s car breaks down in the middle of a beautiful, but
        desolate national park and her 17-year-old daughter Michelle locks
        herself inside, she has no choice but to head off alone and look for
        help. After enlisting the help of the local mechanic Grant, Jessie
        returns to her car to discover that her daughter is gone. Michelle has
        been kidnapped and the police are convinced that Jessie is responsible.
        In this parents-worst-nightmare thriller, Jessie must fight against all
        odds to escape from the police and track down her daughter before she’s
        killed.</image:caption
