        >The film is a stage play hybrid showcasing dark and absurd sketches
        based on contemporary Hungarian news of the 2000's with campy, senseless
        musical interludes in-between. Highly experimental in nature that - like
        Marmite - will split its' crowd into ones that'll love it and others
        that'll loathe it. There's no middle grounds here. The topics included
        are: The Hungarian Olympians' doping scandal, political terrorism, the
        national elections... and more.</image:caption
