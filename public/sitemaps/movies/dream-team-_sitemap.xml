        >Geneva, Switzerland 1935. The first European Basketball Championship is
        about to take place. Basketball is still an unknown sport in Europe, and
        the national teams are meeting for the first time. Each wants the honour
        of being the first champion. Meanwhile in Latvia, coach Baumanis is
        convinced that he can assemble a team and take it to Geneva. He quickly
        learns however, that triumph and defeat are also part of the game. Coach
        Baumanis faces many difficulties, as well as unexpected help from those
        closest to him.</image:caption
