        >On January 1st of 2007, Mekas began his epic “365” project inspired by
        the Italian poet Petrarca and his Canzoniere. Releasing one film for
        every day of the year through his website, Mekas drew upon a vast
        archive of film and video footage recorded over the past decades, as
        well as new material from his everyday life. The “365” project painted
        an intimate portrait of Mekas’ life, friends and travels, in the
        poignant diaristic style which he has come to embody. The project
        attracted a strong international following and prompted many filmmakers
        around the world to begin their own “365” film and video projects. March
        16, 2007: ”I take Helsinki-Tampere train. Not much snow. At the opening
        of Tampere Film Festival.” – Jonas Mekas</image:caption
