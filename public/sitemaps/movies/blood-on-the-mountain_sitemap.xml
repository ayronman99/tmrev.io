        >Documentary focusing on the environmental and economic injustice and
        corporate control in West Virginia and its rippling effect on all
        American workers. This film tells the story of a hard-working people who
        have historically had limited choices and have never benefited fairly
        from the rich natural resources of their land. The failure to diversify
        the economy has insured control by outside, unrestricted corporations
        with the support of politicians kept in their positions by these very
        same companies.</image:caption
