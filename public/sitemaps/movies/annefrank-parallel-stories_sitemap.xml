        >One single Anne Frank moves us more than the countless others who
        suffered just as she did but whose faces have remained in the
        shadows-Primo Levi. The Oscar®-winning Helen Mirren will introduce
        audiences to Anne Frank's story through the words in her diary. The set
        will be her room in the secret refuge in Amsterdam, reconstructed in
        every detail by set designers from the Piccolo Theatre in Milan. Anne
        Frank this year would have been 90 years old. Anne's story is
        intertwined with that of five Holocaust survivors, teenage girls just
        like her, with the same ideals, the same desire to live: Arianna
        Szörenyi, Sarah Lichtsztejn-Montard, Helga Weiss and sisters Andra and
        Tatiana Bucci. Their testimonies alternate with those of their children
        and grandchildren.</image:caption
