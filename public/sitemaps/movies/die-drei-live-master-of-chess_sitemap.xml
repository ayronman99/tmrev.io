        >It was Peter's idea to invite his friends on a joyride on Justus'
        birthday of all days. In pouring rain, a car breakdown forces the three
        detectives to seek refuge at the creepy "Blackstone" castle. When
        lightning knocks out the power line, the three investigators are stuck
        for good. It soon becomes clear to the three junior detectives that the
        lord of the castle, Count Gallagher, is a real chess fanatic. But not
        only that - the old castle makes a spooky impression and then there is
        Moe, the count's sinister servant. What is it about the chess pieces on
        the dilapidated, centuries-old chess table that seem to move by
        themselves, move after move, as if by magic? Is the old building really
        haunted? The first detective is immediately hooked and senses a new
        case, only Peter wants to run away. It soon becomes clear to the three
        investigators that this is about much more than just a game of
        chess...</image:caption
