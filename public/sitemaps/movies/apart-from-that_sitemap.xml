        >Ulla rents a room in Peggy's home, and they don't talk much. They have
        very little in common, so it seems; Ulla is an introverted student
        beautician who drives a Buick that doesn't belong to her, while Peggy
        has become too old to keep her driver's license and too lonely to care
        about her own reputation. In want of company, Peggy makes emergency
        phone calls to local fire departments, and when there is no fire to put
        out, she offers coffee and nudity in consolation. Meanwhile, when Ulla
        is recruited into an intervention for a fellow classmate of hers-someone
        whom she hardly knows - she is thrown into a new set of circumstances
        that derails her role as a guest in a foreign home full of sound and
        silence. Leo, a Native American road striper for the department of
        transportation, remains haunted by something he can't talk about. While
        all of his co-workers come to him with their constant litany of everyday
        dilemmas...</image:caption
