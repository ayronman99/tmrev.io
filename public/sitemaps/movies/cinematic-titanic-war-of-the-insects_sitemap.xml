        >The bugs shall inherit the earth! Or so says Annabelle, the hottest,
        the sexiest, and by far the craziest psycho blonde chick to hit Japan
        since WWII. Deeply embittered about the whole man's-inhumanity-to-man
        thing, she enacts a diabolical plot to unleash a swarm of mutant insects
        on the world that will destroy all living creatures except creepy
        crawlers. Ensnared in all this madness is a philandering island-hopping
        bug collector and his compliant and slightly pregnant wife, a humorless
        doctor from the mainland, and a United States airman named Charlie,
        whose way of starting a conversation is to hysterically scream
        "Genocide!" and then go off his rocker like the dedicated military
        professional he is. If you want to watch a story where everybody gets
        their nuclear holocaust on in the grand tradition of radioactive
        Japanese monster movies, this is the film for you!</image:caption
