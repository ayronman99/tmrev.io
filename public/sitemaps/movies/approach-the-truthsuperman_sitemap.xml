        >Time to Remove Superman It is fragmentarily a story of death and it can
        also be connected to the opposite - birth. When I did research for this
        work, what was really interesting was an article read that 'We came from
        dirt and we go back to dirt' is everywhere in all religions and
        philosophies of all cultures. And I found that sentence and thought over
        different things and I reached it was meant to be only that way.
        Regardless of primitive or modern society, religions or philosophies
        couldn't help but think human body is rotten away and it is cremated and
        made dirt. We know the process but we haven't seen that. I thought it
        would be meaningful if I made that out to show. We've watched a mummy
        disappearing in a movie using CG but I thought I could visually display
        a message that things we cherished or in which knowledge was contained
        were made dirt or on the other way, they had been dirt before they came
        to us.</image:caption
