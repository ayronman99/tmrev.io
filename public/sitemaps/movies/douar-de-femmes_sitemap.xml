        >At a dangerous time in Algeria, 'Douar de Femmes' is a story of
        ordinary women who manage to defend themselves in extraordinary
        situations. The film focuses on a small village that has been attacked
        more often by terrorists from the surrounding mountains. While the men
        work, the women learn how to handle machine guns and explore the area.
        “Fear has armed us,” says the young woman Sabrina. But despite that
        fear, people get married, children come and keep watch.</image:caption
