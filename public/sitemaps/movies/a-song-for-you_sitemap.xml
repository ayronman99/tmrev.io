        >In A Song for You – a road movie and a music industry insider comedy,
        with lots of songs – young Ngawang leaves behind a nomadic existence on
        the Tibetan plateau for big city Lhasa nightclubs. His dream is to
        record an album and be heard around the country. Cutting an album costs
        money, which he doesn’t have. One day he meets a woman who looks just
        like his Loyiter, a talisman of the goddess of art and music.
        Impossible, says his father, as only the pure of heart meet her, only in
        their dreams. But, Ngawang perseveres. She takes him on a journey of
        discovery through life and love.</image:caption
