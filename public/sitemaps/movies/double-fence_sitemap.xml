        >Double Fence was shot from the balcony of a B&B in Porto Potenza Picena
        , on the Adriatic coast near Ancona . The work explores the changes that
        occur with slight shifts in framings of the same scene, and the dramatic
        alterations in light, colour , space and movement between early morning
        and late afternoon. The work is the third in a series that records
        spontaneously occurring moir√© patterns and related phenomena. The
        multifarious birdsong emanates from a nearby animal and bird
        sanctuary.</image:caption
