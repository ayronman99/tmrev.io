        >Enter Buddy Flavenoid, a writer/director of 1950's Hollywood horror B
        films who is not all that stable. After an actor from his latest movie
        "Attack of the Atomic Reptiles" tries to get him fired, Buddy is
        determined to see his project through by killing him with a baseball bat
        to the head. Unfortunately his homicidal ambition was not enough to save
        his movie from dying at the box office. Several years later a mysterious
        investor appears and wants to finance and produce another Buddy
        Flavinoid film "Attack of the Slime People." Buddy, who has sunk to
        being a bathroom attendant, is back and is more determined than ever to
        make HIS film HIS way and those that try to interfere with his vision
        are once again dispatched with the help of his trusted Louisville
        slugger.</image:caption
