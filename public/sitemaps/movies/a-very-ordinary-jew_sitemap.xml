        >What does being a Jew mean nowadays? Emanuel Goldfarb, a Jewish
        journalist, is asked by the Director of a Jewish community in Germany,
        to respond to an invitation by a professor to tell his pupils about his
        life as a Jew living in Germany. This conversation, performed by
        Goldfarb and the Director of the community, is the only scene of Oliver
        Hirschbiegel's film « Ein ganz gewohnlicher Jude » presented at the Film
        and Television Festival of Genève, which was shot outdoors and it's the
        only moment where something apparently happens.</image:caption
