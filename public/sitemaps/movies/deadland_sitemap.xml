        >In the radiation-infected aftermath of World War III, one man's
        desperate attempt to find his wife in the wastelands that were once the
        United States inspires his fellow survivors to fight for humanity. The
        bomb has dropped, and in the blink of an eye, America has been plunged
        back into the Stone Age. Money is worthless, food is scarce, and those
        who once thought they were fortunate to survive the initial attack are
        now slowly being consumed from the inside out, the victims of an
        all-consuming nuclear scourge. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi</image:caption
