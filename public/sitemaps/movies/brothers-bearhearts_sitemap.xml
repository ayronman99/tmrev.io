        >The heroes of the film are three bear cubs from the cult painting by
        Ivan Shishkin "Morning in a Pine Forest". After losing their painter
        mom, the three brothers Henry, Vincent, and August appear in Paris, the
        City of Light every creator dreams of. All attempts to earn their living
        as artists fail. Their impressionistic "collies" won't be acknowledged.
        Under cover as circus lions, the bear cubs travel back to Russia to find
        the heritage of their mom.</image:caption
