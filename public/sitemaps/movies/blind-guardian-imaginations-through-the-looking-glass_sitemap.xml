        >Blind Guardian intended to record a DVD since early 1998, however, due
        to the band's high requirements, no existing metal festival had been
        considered suitable. Instead, Blind Guardian decided to create their own
        festival, back in their homeland. The First Blind Guardian Festival was
        held in Coburg, Germany, at June 16â€“17, 2003. It lasted 2 days, with the
        band playing during both nights. The entire show has been professionally
        recorded and subsequently released on a DVD entitled Imaginations
        through the Looking Glass in June 14, 2004.</image:caption
