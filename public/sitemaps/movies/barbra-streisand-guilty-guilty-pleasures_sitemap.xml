        >Guilty Pleasures is an album by Barbra Streisand in conjunction with
        Barry Gibb released in September 2005. In Ireland and the United
        Kingdom, the album is titled Guilty Too. It is the follow-up to
        Streisand's 1980 album, Guilty, which also featured Barry Gibb. The
        album features a cover of Gibb's late brother Andy's song "(Our Love)
        Don't Throw It All Away". In the United States the album peaked at no. 5
        and has been certified Gold (500,000 copies sold) continuing Streisand's
        record of achieving the most gold and platinum records for a female
        artist, and in second place in general behind Elvis
        Presley.</image:caption
