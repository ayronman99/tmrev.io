        >Comedian Beth Stelling takes the stage at Minneapolis’ Varsity Theater
        to talk sex, drugs, and babies in her hilarious new special Beth
        Stelling: Girl Daddy. Musing on the ways that sexual pleasure is
        different for men and women, Stelling’s not ashamed to admit that she
        always thinks her massage therapist is falling for her – and is not
        afraid to call male comedians out for making lazy #MeToo jokes. Stelling
        also shares her takes on being a relationship person, having reverse
        body dysmorphia, alternative wedding traditions, her relationship with
        her Orlando-based actor father whose personality is “Fox News,” talking
        sex with her may-as-well-be-virginal mom, and how her sisters just love
        to make babies.</image:caption
