        >From acclaimed filmmaker Sherine Salama, the story follows a marriage
        between an American-based Palestinian man (Bassam Abed) and a young
        woman (Mariam), with a traditional village upbringing. Bassam works as a
        telephone repairman in Cleveland, Ohio, and returns to the West Bank
        town of Ramallah to find a wife. A few weeks later the two are married
        and we are offered unique insight into the arranged wedding. The film
        subsequently follows their desperate attempts to secure a visa to
        America for Mariam, and her resulting life in Cleveland, languishing in
        an apartment with no friends or support.</image:caption
