        >It is the biggest unsolved serial murder case in British criminal
        history - the so-called 'Jack the Stripper' murders took place in
        Swinging Sixties London. Professor Wilson and his investigative team -
        which includes former detective Jackie Malton and forensic psychologist
        Professor Mike Berry - begin their hunt for the killer not in London,
        but 150 miles away in Abertillery, South Wales. In 1921, the Welsh
        mining town was devastated by the double murder of two schoolgirls when
        eight-year-old Freda Brunell and 11-year-old Florence Little were killed
        just weeks apart by a local boy, 15-year-old Harold Jones, who the
        Abertillery residents still refer to as their 'Dark Son'.</image:caption
