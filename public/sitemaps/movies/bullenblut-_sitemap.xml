        >After years of absence, the Yakuza Gang around Max and Jay Jay are
        finally up to mischief again. And it would be all right for the naughty
        homies if the Deliquentes Clan could keep their hands off the big deal.
        The police, who are known not to shy away from losses, are getting
        closer and closer to resolving the case through the clever investigation
        by special agent Joe Miller ... But in this world, where violence is
        preferred over prudence, the barometer stands for death - and that's
        exactly what we're going to see. Bullenblut 2 is supposed to reveal how
        things really go on Winterthur's streets, nothing more and nothing
        less.</image:caption
