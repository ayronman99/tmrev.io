        >A middle aged bachelor Mario spent his life taking care of his
        eccentric sister Brenda. He sells goodies in a mobile cart for a living.
        His daily routine gets a sudden turnaround when his dying friend Arnold
        made him promise to take care of his daughter Ana. But Ana is not just
        an ordinary little girl, despite her angelic look; she is cunning and
        mischievous who is in search of her estranged mother. Mario and Ana
        agreed that they would earn money to look for Anaâ€™s mother in Cebu, but
        Ana should tame down. Mario performs his new task as a father to the
        orphan child in a very unconventional way. But through the help of a
        beautiful teacher named Maribel, he would always keep things
        going.</image:caption
