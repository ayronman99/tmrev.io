        >Due to suspicion of BSE (mad cow disease), a herd of cows from a small
        farmstead is sentenced to be killed. The animals' revolt and try to
        escape. People try to hunt them down but the herd, led by Bella, manages
        to protect itself. Further failures of people increase their
        aggressiveness. The escalating battle has little in common with the
        original veterinary prevention. However, there are also people who try
        to help the cows, who desire nothing more than free life in the great
        outdoors, even if they are also forced to learn how to live and survive
        without anybody to feed them, milk them or fill them up with medicine.
        They learn all about hunger, cold, deprivation and pain. And the loss of
        loved ones...</image:caption
