        >Bronze is a down on his luck thespian who needs a break badly.
        Literally living off his one recognizable moment in the TV cop show Boys
        in Blue (he played a TV stealing criminal), he spends his days hustling,
        his nights arguing with his live-in companion, a transvestite Christian
        rock wannabe. After a beer can robbery goes wrong, Bronze gets his
        songwriting pal an audition. When that falls through, he hits rock
        bottom. A bout with cellphone-induced ear cancer and an incident with a
        haphazardly thrown can of soup seals his sad fate.</image:caption
