        >Ian and his sister Stephy haven't always had much to look forward to on
        Christmas. One way or another, they always get stuck with grumpy old
        Grandpa for the holidays. Ian knows that this Christmas will be
        different. When Ian and Stephy get invited to a big Christmas party,
        they set out to discover what Christmas is really about. Along the way
        they will meet many interesting characters, including a very helpful
        angel, a kind old saint, and a very special little baby. Before the
        night is over, Ian and Stephy will learn that Christmas isn't about how
        much they can get, but how much they can give. They learn that the most
        important and meaningful gifts come from within, and the gifts from
        within are gifts from God.</image:caption
