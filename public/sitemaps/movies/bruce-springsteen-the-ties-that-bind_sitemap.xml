        >Employing an intimate interview style, Grammy- and Emmy®-winning
        filmmaker Thom Zimny showcases Bruce Springsteen’s first-person take on
        his writing process. Offering an in-depth discussion on the origins of
        key tracks from his first double album, The River, Springsteen shares
        how they were developed, from the notebook page to the studio to, most
        viscerally, the concert stage. Interspersed throughout the interview are
        his acoustic versions of several defining tracks from The River,
        including “Two Hearts,” “The River,” “Independence Day,” “Hungry Heart,”
        “Point Blank” and “Wreck on the Highway.”</image:caption
