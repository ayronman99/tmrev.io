        >Maverick director Melvin Van Peebles translates his own satirical novel
        to the screen with this multi-national portrait of race, class, and
        hypocrisy. The film's title refers to the name of a haute cuisine
        restaurant run by a self-satisfied conservative couple, Henri and
        Loretta. When the two find themselves overworked in the kitchen, they
        retreat to the local orphanage to find some cheap waitressing help, and
        the teenaged Diamantine fits the bill perfectly. The haughty couple has
        more plans for the girl than just waiting tables, however -- the
        conspicuously accommodating Henri and Loretta are actually bad-mouthing
        the girl behind her back to the townspeople and the restaurant's
        patrons. They go so far as to ask the naive Diamantine to pretend that
        she's pregnant, and she complies under the assumption that it's a
        harmless prank. When their intentions are revealed, however, the girl
        becomes wise to the couple's self-satisfied scheming, and sets her
        sights on revenge.</image:caption
