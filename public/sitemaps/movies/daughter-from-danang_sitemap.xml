        >In 1975, as the Vietnam War was ending, thousands of orphans and
        Amerasian children were brought to the United States as part of
        "Operation Babylift." Daughter from Danang tells the dramatic story of
        one of these children, Heidi Bub (a.k.a. Mai Thi Hiep), and her
        Vietnamese mother, Mai Thi Kim, separated at the war's end and reunited
        22 years later. Heidi, now living in Tennessee - a married woman with
        kids - had always dreamt of a joyful reunion. When she ventures to
        Vietnam to meet her mother, she unknowingly embarks on an emotional
        pilgrimage that spans decades and distance. Unlike most reunion stories
        that climax with a clich√© happy ending, Daughter from Danang is a
        real-life drama. Journeying from the Vietnam War to Pulaski, Tennessee
        and back to Vietnam, Daughter from Danang tensely unfolds as cultural
        differences and the years of separation take their toll in a riveting
        film about longing and the personal legacy of war.</image:caption
