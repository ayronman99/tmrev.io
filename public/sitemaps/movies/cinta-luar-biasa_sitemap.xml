        >The movie is based on the relationships of four friends – Farah, Husin,
        Adam and Hamidah – who promise to meet again 10 years after their
        graduation. A decade later, Farah is a successful photographer, Hamidah
        is an entertainment magazine columnist, Husin has become a cameraman and
        Adam is a music tutor. A comedy of errors follow when the bunch, who
        each has personal problems, meet in Pulau Langkawi. Farah’s busy
        schedule does not permit her to fall in love, though she is acquainted
        with Halim, a bright but bumbling lawyer. Then there’s Husin who has
        sacrificed much while taking care of his paralysed mother. Hamidah, on
        the other hand, has long fancied Husin, and dresses to kill for the
        reunion and does everything she can to attract his attention. As for
        Adam, he has a jealous girlfriend in Aleya who is envious of the close
        ties between her beau and Farah, though the duo’s relationship is purely
        platonic.</image:caption
