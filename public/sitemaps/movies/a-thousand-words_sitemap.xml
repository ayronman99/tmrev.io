        >Jack McCall is a fast-talking literary agent, who can close any deal,
        any time, any way. He has set his sights on New Age guru Dr. Sinja for
        his own selfish purposes. But Dr. Sinja is on to him, and Jack’s life
        comes unglued after a magical Bodhi tree mysteriously appears in his
        backyard. With every word Jack speaks, a leaf falls from the tree and he
        realizes that when the last leaf falls, both he and the tree are toast.
        Words have never failed Jack McCall, but now he’s got to stop talking
        and conjure up some outrageous ways to communicate or he’s a
        goner.</image:caption
