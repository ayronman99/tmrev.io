        >When Nobita feels like diving in his hometown, Doraemon uses a
        Underwater Pump Simulator to pump all the water out of Tokyo, causing
        the entire city to go underwater. That night, Doraemon and Nobita use a
        Diving Mask Simulator to dive underwater. Later on, lots of fish, and a
        shark attack Doraemon and Nobita. So, Doraemon puts a stop on the
        Underwater Pump Simulator, but there is a girl named Sophia, lying down
        on the bushes in his neighborhood.</image:caption
