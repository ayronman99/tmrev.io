        >During a family outing to a cinema, a young boy falls asleep. His mind
        flashes back to an early memory where, as a toddler, his family try to
        take a photo of him in their backyard. As he drifts in and out of sleep,
        his memory and the present begin to merge. Dennis Tupicoff's 2017 short
        film premiered at the prestigious Annecy International Animated Film
        Festival. The film's combination of hand-drawn animation with live
        action clips of the 1950 Film Noir D.O.A,, awakeness with sleep, and
        past with present creates a surreal quality that emanates throughout the
        film.</image:caption
