        >Bhaskaran is a happy-go-lucky guy, who is yet to complete his B.A.
        degree, writing arrear examinations annually for years. His only friend
        is Nallathambi who owns a barber saloon, which he received as a dowry
        for marrying a two-month pregnant woman. He lives with his mother,
        Sivakami, brother Saravanan who is a successful veterinarian and sister,
        Nithya. When his brother marries Nandhini, he gets to meet Nandhini's
        younger sister Chandrika and wishes to marry her. When he approaches his
        family for a chance, everyone talks very frankly of his unemployed
        status which rankles him and he leaves his house to prove himself. With
        the support of Nallathambi, he establishes a tutorial for Class 10
        students and despite early setbacks makes it work, while also convincing
        Chandrika, who eventually reciprocates his love. However despite all
        this, Chandrika's father is against her marriage with Bhaskaran for a
        reason which is revealed in the end.</image:caption
