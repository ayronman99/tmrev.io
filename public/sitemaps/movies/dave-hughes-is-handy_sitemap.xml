        >The only thing Dave Hughes is handy for is a laugh, which is handy
        given he calls himself a comedian. Hes made a handy name for himself on
        radio and TV as a funny man but live on stage is where Hughesy began
        (&amp; continues to shine). Whats handy for you is that hes recorded his
        latest sell out show for you to watch from the comfort of your couch.
        DVD extras include an intimate club gig and candid at home footage of
        Hughesy and family.</image:caption
