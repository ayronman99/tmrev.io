        >Socialite Judith Traherne lives a lavish but emotionally empty life.
        Riding horses is one of her few joys, and her stable master is secretly
        in love with her. Told she has a brain tumor by her doctor, Frederick
        Steele, Judith becomes distraught. After she decides to have surgery to
        remove the tumor, Judith realizes she is in love with Dr. Steele, but
        more troubling medical news may sabotage her new relationship, and her
        second chance at life.</image:caption
