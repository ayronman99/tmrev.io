        >Hatice has a problem: she desperately needs a man. Because her younger
        sister Fatma is pregnant and must marry immediately. However, that is
        only allowed when Hatice is under the hood, as the old Anatolian
        tradition, to which the father Ismail firmly clings. But where should
        Hatice find a groom so fast? Because a Turk may not be under any
        circumstances, which may blaze in the German man already a bit Turkish
        fire. And so Hatice goes in search of her "Hans with hot
        sauce".</image:caption
