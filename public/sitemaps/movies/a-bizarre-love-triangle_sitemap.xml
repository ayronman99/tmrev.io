        >Eun-hee is an extravagant and selfish woman who lives a life of luxury.
        She constantly swears, acts extremely careless, and is unashamedly
        tactless. Yet she somehow manages to be loved by both her husband,
        Doo-chan, and Keum-sook, a childhood female friend. However, what
        Doo-chan doesn't know is that Eun-hee and Keum-sook are secretly
        involved in a love affair. As Keum-sook continues to grow jealous with
        the two women. All three then enter the twists of love, betrayal, and
        revenge as they will all go to the extreme to get what they
        want.</image:caption
