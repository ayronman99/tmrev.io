        >Yugoslav Nobel Prize winner Ivo Andrić’s novel ‘A Bridge over the
        Drina’ describes a yearslong conflict of the local people of the Bosnian
        region around the town of Višegrad. This short documentary rightly
        evokes associations with the novel. As a kind of annex to the novel, the
        film combines the scenes of the bridge with the testimony of Mevsud
        Poljo from the nearby village of Vlahovići, who was pulling dead bodies
        out of the Drina in order to identify them. Although we do not see
        Mevsud, we get to know how many men and how many women were among the
        dead, whether there were traces of violence or rape on them... And the
        Drina keeps fl owing under the bridge...</image:caption
