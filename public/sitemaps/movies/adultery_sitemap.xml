        >A boy starts an affair with his famous dad's young new wife - an
        instinctive way of victory of a confused soul over his parent's
        inadequacy. Ever haunting dreams about his real mother start
        overwhelming the boy more and more often. Unsuspecting a thing, the
        father keeps trying to carry out his own views on beauty upon their
        joint living. In vain - faith intends differently.</image:caption
