        >This film follows the Hani Nationality's deteriorating traditional way
        of life. As their terrace fields can no longer support them, Alu and
        many of his fellow villagers must leave home in search of a better
        livelihood elsewhere. They are trapped into working in a coal mine, and
        after many months of servitude can do nothing but flee to Kunming to try
        their luck. But Kunming has little to offer these uneducated and
        unskilled youth from the countryside. So what is left for them to
        do?</image:caption
