        >Yusaku Hayakawa dreams of becoming a detective, but works as a trainer
        for police dogs. When Yusaku gets an albino shepherd named Shiro, he
        forms a special bond with him. Everyone says that Shiro does not have
        the abilities to become a police dog, but Yusaku believes in him and
        trains him. When a terrorist act occurs, Shiro gets the chance to show
        what he has learned.</image:caption
