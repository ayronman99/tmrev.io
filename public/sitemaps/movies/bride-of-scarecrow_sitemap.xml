        >A failing radio host finds out she has inherited a farm house in Wales
        from a family she never knew she had. But what goes on the land is story
        in which people have gone missing every 20 years. Fixed on repairing her
        career, she sets off with her friends to make the ultimate discovery for
        her radio show - but what she discovers may well be what she would least
        expect - for every 20 years, the Scarecrow will rise, and this time -
        he's seeking a bride.</image:caption
