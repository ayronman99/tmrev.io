        >On the Al Murray: The Pub Landlord - Live At The Palladium DVD, the
        award winning comedian raises the roof at the majestic London Palladium,
        where he gave a crowning performance of his hit tour show "And Another
        Thing" in 2007. In this show, Britain’s favourite Pub Landlord holds
        court with his distinctive common sense, reasoning on subjects such as
        "The War on Terror", "Hell", "Life Itself", and his personal crusade to
        "Bring Back Shame". Expect "unstoppable comedy from the joke-telling
        machine gun" (The Sunday Times), who showcases his trademark rapid-fire
        interaction with the regulars. Having already become famed by the
        success of his prime-time entertainment show "Happy Hour", and an
        unprecedented second "An Audience with Al Murray: The Pub Landlord", the
        Guv’nor shines in top form on this DVD.</image:caption
