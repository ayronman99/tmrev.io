        >This historical documentary addresses a subject typically given short
        shrift in discussions of World War II: the role of Malta in pivotal
        Second World War battles. The program argues that because of the
        island's key location - sandwiched, as it is, in-between Southern Europe
        and Northern Africa - it inevitably impeded Axis and Allied
        reinforcement deliveries time and again. As a result, the Maltese people
        found themselves caught in the middle of a crossfire when they had
        virtually nothing to do with the war itself, and suffered immensely for
        their geographic placement. In telling this seldom-heard story, the
        program draws on first-person interviews, CGI animations, and dramatic
        recreations.</image:caption
