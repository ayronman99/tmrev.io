        >“What kind of person do you think former President Park Geunhye is?”
        Sohn Seokhee, a journalist, gives a clear and sharp answer that he
        “shares the common ideas that people in our country have.” That common
        idea has led millions to bring candles to the streets, correcting a
        thread of history that has gone awry, and gather a sense of hope among
        people. Candlelight Revolution portrays the voices of citizens from
        various generations, political figures of diﬀerent parties, and the
        witnesses of an administration under improper inﬂuence. It is a
        documentary that identifies the genuine structure of politics and
        society by following how Park entered politics along with government
        records up until March 10.</image:caption
