        >The film tells the story of the friendship between Johann and Ludwig as
        they strive for the ultimate “buddy” relationship. Going beyond, well
        beyond, what would be considered good and healthy, the pair attempt to
        become the ideal twins, driving their relationship based on their
        partnership in competitive rowing (coxless pairs) to the ultimate, to
        perfect harmony in mind, word, thought and deed. But their symbiotic
        relationship is thrown out of balance: Ludwig strives to tighten the
        bonds ever closer, but Johann discovers happiness in the form of love
        for Ludwig’s sister, Vera. But because Ludwig hates her, the couple keep
        their relationship secret. But secrets have a way of coming out and
        Ludwig is wounded to the core. As the finals of the rowing competition
        draw closer, Ludwig has already set his sights on a greater goal: to
        preserve their friendship forever, no longer in life but in
        death.</image:caption
