        >Hayato comes back to his home village after father breaks his legs and
        cannot walk anymore. He brings his wife Ami along with him, who had a
        miscarriage and has been dysfunctional and depressed ever since. Hayato
        hangs with his old friends and enjoys the life of the village, but Ami
        is a city girl and is growing lonelier. She finds comfort in the arms of
        Hayato's father. It's not long before everybody in the small village is
        aware of their relationship... except Hayato... A drama about betrayal
        and the illogical nature of love and happiness.</image:caption
