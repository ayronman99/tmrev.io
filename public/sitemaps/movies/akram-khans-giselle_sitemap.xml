        >Hailed as a masterpiece of 21st century dance, Akram Khan’s Giselle
        comes to cinemas for the first time with Artistic Director, Tamara Rojo,
        dancing the role of Giselle, one of a community of migrant workers cast
        out of their jobs in a condemned garment factory. The classic story of
        love, betrayal and redemption has been reimagined in this stunning new
        version, with sets and costumes by Academy-Award winning designer Tim
        Yip (Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon), an ‘ominous, gothic’ (The Observer)
        adaptation of Adolphe Adam’s original score by composer Vincenzo Lamagna
        and performed by English National Ballet Philharmonic, dramaturgy from
        Ruth Little and lighting design from Tony Award-winner Mark Henderson.
        Filmed live at the Liverpool Empire in October 2017, Akram Khan’s
        Giselle is directed for the screen by Ross MacGibbon.</image:caption
