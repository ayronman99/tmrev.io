        >Mandy, the owner of a craft and hobby store, discovers an old copy of
        “A Christmas Carol” among donations for a book drive. In the book is a
        letter to Santa from 70 years ago along with a valuable coin. Mandy sets
        out to find the owner of the book, letter and coin with the help of
        Jonah, a contractor who first came upon and donated the book. Along the
        way, they find clues that lead them closer to the author, and to each
        other, but can Mandy return everything to the book owner in time for
        Christmas and make her own Christmas wish come true?</image:caption
