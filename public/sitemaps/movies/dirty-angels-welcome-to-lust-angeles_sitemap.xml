        >In a town where dreams come to die, all that’s left is reality’s dirty
        angel. These are the stories of small town hopes – dashed on the
        concrete slabs of Sunset Boulevard’s Walk of Fame: tales of ambition and
        the torrid consequences thereof. Bobby came to make movies, but he’ll
        find the path to a career in filmmaking one with many twists, bends… and
        bumps, providing him an education in erotica he never would have gotten
        back home. Meanwhile, nestled in the Hollywood Hills, is the home of
        Tracy Hendrickson (Diana Espen), a successful glamour model and trophy
        wife who escaped her small town existence, but not her nosey, kiss-ass
        cousin (Juliana Kincaid) who came to stay for the summer. Can Tracy turn
        her cousin into a bombshell sex goddess before the summer is
        over?</image:caption
