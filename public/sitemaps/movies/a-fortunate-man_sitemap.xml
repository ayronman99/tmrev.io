        >On his quest for happiness, Per decides to leave Jutland and an
        upbringing in a strict religious home. He runs from his family and his
        patriarch father, and sets sail towards Copenhagen to become an
        engineer. Parallel to his studies, he works on a visionary energy
        project based on wind and wave energy, a project so much ahead of its
        time, that professors consider him insane and far too self-confident.
        However, Per’s project becomes a success and he marries the beautiful
        Jakobe who is a part of a wealthy Jewish family. One would imagine that
        Per’s happiness now is made. But Per’s childhood keeps haunting him and
        his dogmatic family cannot accept his new life. Despite his luck and
        success, Per is unable to fully cut the strings to his strict religious
        background, and he now fears that he will repeat his father’s
        patriarchist behavior.</image:caption
