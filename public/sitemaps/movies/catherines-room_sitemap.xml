        >This video work is one of a group of pieces known as 'The Passions'
        which explores human emotions, inspired by early European devotional
        paintings. The five screens show different times of the day â€“ morning,
        afternoon, sunset, evening and night. Each scene shows the female
        protagonist at a different task, from yoga exercises in the morning
        through to lighting candles in the evening and finally going to bed. In
        each scene, the tree outside the window is shown at different stages of
        its annual cycle, putting the woman's routine in the larger context of
        the cycles of nature. The work is based on a predella by the fourteenth
        century artist Andrea di Bartolo.</image:caption
