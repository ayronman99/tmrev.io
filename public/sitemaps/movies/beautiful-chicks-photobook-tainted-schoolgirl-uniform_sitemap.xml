        >A man disembarks a train at a countryside train station. He is from the
        area. He reminisces about a girl in a school uniform he had met and
        known. He had left town twelve years ago. He had three close friends
        while at high school and they always hung out together. They were two
        boys and two girls. He stole money from his grandparents and ran away to
        Tokyo to become a film director. He is back because he has become a
        director.</image:caption
