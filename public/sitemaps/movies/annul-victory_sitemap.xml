        >Annul Victory is a documentary on the fight for marriage equality and
        the Proposition 8 election battle. The film documents the roller coaster
        ride of emotions in California after the historical state Supreme Court
        decision in May of 2008, finding it unconstitutional to deny gays and
        lesbians the right to be married in the state, and then the passage of
        Proposition 8 in November, denying gays and lesbians marriage rights,
        and “annulling” thousands of marriages. The story is told through the
        life and experiences of Robin Tyler and Diane Olson, one of the 14
        couples involved in the historic litigation, with a look at some of the
        18,000 couples who got married during the window of “legality” between
        May and November, with thought and commentary provided by a host of
        celebrities.</image:caption
