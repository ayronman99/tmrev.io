        >Irma (Claudia Gerini), Eugenia (Angela Finocchiaro), Miranda (Caterina
        Guzzanti) and Rina (Paola Minaccioni) are four different women, each
        with their own character, their own weaknesses and their own
        eccentricities, but linked by a deep and lasting knowledge over time,
        united and marked by their essential card games. When they decide to
        participate in a national buraco tournament and get out of their
        everyday life, they will suddenly find themselves with their cards
        exposed. Life always offers a second chance and love can go back to
        upsetting at any age. After all, it is the game of burraco that has
        taught him that a game must be played completely, to the end, and that
        no result is ever taken for granted.</image:caption
