        >Someone has stolen the giant charity box from the Shpittburgh
        synagogue, and Agent E is called upon to crack the case. The prime
        suspect is none other than the diabolical Dr. Lo-Tov. But just as Agent
        Emes is about to bring him in, the police identify a different suspect,
        someone VERY CLOSE to Agent Emes. With the case taking on a more
        personal turn, Agent Emes must race against the clock to uncover the
        truth behind the stolen pushka. The story evolves in classic "whodunit"
        fashion, with a number of likely suspects emerging, before episode 3
        reaches its shocking conclusion.</image:caption
