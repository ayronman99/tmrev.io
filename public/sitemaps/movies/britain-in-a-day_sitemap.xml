        >On Saturday 12 November 2011, an eclectic range of British people
        turned the camera on themselves, capturing the entertaining and mundane,
        the exciting and unusual, the poignant and the everyday. The result,
        Britain in a Day tells the fascinating story of the British public in
        their own words. Following on from the feature film Life in a Day, this
        90-minute film directed by BAFTA winner Morgan Matthews offers an
        extraordinarily candid look at 21st-century life across the UK, crafted
        from over 750 hours of footage, including 11,526 clips submitted to
        YouTube. The documentary offers remarkable insight into the lives,
        loves, fears and hopes of people living in Britain today. This
        captivating self-portrait of Britain forms part of the BBC's Cultural
        Olympiad.</image:caption
