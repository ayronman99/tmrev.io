        >Rodney, a businessman, has two daughters, Vicky and Jane. So when
        Rodney owes money to Mafia boss, Mark, he is asked to give his daughter
        as settlement. Vicky doesn’t mind, as she likes Mark. Before their
        wedding, Mark takes Vicky to Gunung Kidul. An accident occurs and Vicky
        is found dead at the mountain. In turn, Rodney gives Jane to Mark as
        Vicky's replacement so that their business relationship runs smoothly.
        Then Jane begins to see strange events and has nightmares. So when Jane
        moves to Mark’s luxurious house, she sees some things that were in her
        dreams, a crystal lamp, a bronze bell in front of the door to the pool,
        and the swinging chair. Time passes by and the mystery begins to
        unravel.</image:caption
