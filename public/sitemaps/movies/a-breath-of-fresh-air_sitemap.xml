        >Two proud and estranged brothers, a disputed inheritance and a past
        that comes back. When he hears about the passing of his father - whom he
        has not seen in many years - Salvo returns to his native Sicily. He
        intends to convince his brother Lillo to sell the family farm and save
        his pizzeria, which is about to go bankrupt - a secret that he has kept
        even from his wife and children. But things will not be easy and Salvo
        will have to come to terms with his choices. A bittersweet comedy about
        family relations and how one never stops growing up, not even at
        fifty.</image:caption
