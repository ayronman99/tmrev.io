        >"A Short History of Decay" tells the story of Nathan Fisher, a
        thirty-something Brooklyn “hipster” (Greenberg) whose writing career is
        stalled, much to the chagrin of his ambitious live-in girlfriend, Erika
        (Chriqui). When she unceremoniously dumps him, Nathan retreats into a
        depressive funk, not knowing where to turn-- finish the novel? work on
        the play?-- when he gets a call from his brother in Florida telling him
        his father has been hospitalized. Racing down to "snowbird" central,
        Nathan finds his father (Yulin) on the mend (albeit grumpy), and his
        normally addled mother (Lavin) a bit hazier than usual. His quick visit
        turns into an extended stay during which he discovers that his aging
        parents are actually in much better control of their lives than he is.
        He also meets a woman (Perkins)--his mother's manicurist, no less-- who
        is the polar opposite of Erika, but who may just be exactly what Nathan
        needs.</image:caption
