        >Canned Heat was one of the hardest living, and hardest working, bands
        of the late sixties and all throughout the seventies. Led by the
        inimitable Bob The Bear Hite, a huge man with a personality to match,
        they established themselves as one of the greatest white blues bands of
        all time. This concert from Montreux in 1973, their only appearance at
        the festival, captures them at their peak, and features a guest
        appearance from Clarence Gatemouth Brown.</image:caption
