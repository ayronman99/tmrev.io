        >In 2006, when the Brazilian economy was taking off due to the discovery
        of oil in the pre-salt layer, Eike Batista decided to create the oil
        company OGX and hired the best men from Petrobras to participate in the
        pre-salt auction. But megalomaniacal plans and a series of misguided
        decisions and alliances cause their empire to crumble as spectacularly
        as it had grown. And Brazil watches, perplexed, the fall of Eike, who
        loses all his fortune, power and prestige. Inspired by the book by
        journalist Malu Gaspar.</image:caption
