        >Hyang-gi hates her mother who only likes men and doesn't take care of
        herself. She brings a man to her house to sleep over so her mom will
        find her crooked. To correct Hyang-gi, she asked Do-hwan, Hyang-giâ€™s
        cousin, to live with her at home for a while. Hyang-gi and Do-hwan, who
        were reunited as adults, grew very attracted to each other. Chae-kyeong,
        Do-hwan's girlfriend, finds out about it. After revealing the truth in
        front of everyone, Hyang-gi and Do-hwan are on the verge of breaking
        up.</image:caption
