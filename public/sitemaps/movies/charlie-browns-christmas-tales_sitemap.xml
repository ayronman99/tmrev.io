        >Tis the season for the cheer and charm of the Peanuts kids - and this
        delight special offers five segments full of unforgettable moments.
        Snoopy works as a bell-ringer to raise money and tries making peace with
        the ferocious cat next door. Linus strives to strike the right tone in
        his letter to Santa - and his friendship with an indecisive girl at
        school. Sally's idea about gift giving and the identity of Santa may be
        unusual - but her strange notion about how to obtain a Christmas tree
        surprisingly does the job. Lucy tries awfully hard to be nice...and
        still coax everyone around her to buy her presents. Charlie Brown and
        Sally wait up for Santa (a surprisingly short man), who spreads
        Christmas gift cheer further than they had thought. Make
        merry!</image:caption
