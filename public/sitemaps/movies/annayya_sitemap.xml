        >Rajaram (Chiranjeevi), owner of a fleet of lorries, meets Devi
        (Soundarya), a garment factory owner. After that acquaintance, she once
        seeks his help in dealing with two street ruffians, who were teasing her
        sisters, Lata (Chandini) and Geetha (Sishwa), and is shocked when the
        culprits turn out to be his brothers, Ravi (Ravi Teja) and Gopi
        (Venkat). Rajaram takes the incident lightly as the pranks of youngsters
        and is very lenient to them. With more such incidents, the two fall in
        love, with the brothers and sisters not far behind. On his brothers'
        request, Rajaram approaches Devi for her sisters' hands in marriage to
        his brothers. But she curtly refuses her consent on grounds that the two
        are wayward drunkards. Rajaram reacts sharply to it and vows to get his
        brothers married to her sisters. Since then on he is more exacting with
        his brothers and brings about a transformation in them. Devi agrees to
        their marriage.</image:caption
