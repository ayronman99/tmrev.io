        >The wildly popular British television show Absolutely Fabulous gets a
        Francophonic makeover with this film version directed by Gabriel Aghion.
        In this go around, Josiane Balasko and Nathalie Baye play the
        incorrigible Eddie and Patsy, who leave no impulse unenacted and no lust
        unsated -- be it for sex or the latest in designer clothing. Waking up
        from a night of drunken debauchery, the two dip right into a feast of
        champagne and caviar, much to the irritation of Eddie's elegant mother
        and her resentful daughter. As Eddie stretches an appalling pair of
        leopard-print leotards (complete with matching shoes, purse, and hat)
        over her massive rear end, she and Patsy learn of a handsome young
        Rollerblading delivery boy who quickly becomes the object of their lust.
        This film was screened at the 2001 Toronto Film Festival.</image:caption
