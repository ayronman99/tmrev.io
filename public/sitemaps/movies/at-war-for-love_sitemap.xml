        >It's 1943 and World War II is raging in Europe. In New York, Arturo and
        Flora the daughter of a restaurant owner are in love, but she is
        promised in marriage to the son of a Mafia boss. There is a way around
        this, but to be able to marry Flora, Arturo needs to get permission from
        her father, who lives in a village in Sicily. Arturo doesn't have any
        money, so the only way he can get to Sicily is to enlist in the U.S.
        Army, which is preparing for a landing on the island.</image:caption
