        >Anthropologist Jeff Salz investigates lesser-known myths surrounding
        the fate of Jesus, examining the discovery of an Indian tomb some claim
        may have contained Christ's remains. Assessing suggestions that he may
        have survived the Crucifixion and ended his days in India, or travelled
        there with traders during the undocumented portion of his life, Salz
        considers why many Kashmiris believe Jesus had an impact on their
        country.</image:caption
