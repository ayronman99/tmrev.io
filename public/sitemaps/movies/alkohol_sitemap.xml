        >Alcohol: No substance in the world seems so familiar to us and is so
        incredibly diverse in its effect. Alcohol is available everywhere and
        this particular molecule has the power to affect all 200 billion neurons
        of our human brain in completely different ways. But hardly anyone calls
        alcohol a drug despite its psychoactive and cell-destroying effect. Why
        do we tolerate the death of three million people every year? Have we
        turned a blind eye to the dangers and risks for thousands of years? What
        role does the powerful alcohol industry play with an annual turnover of
        1.2 trillion euros in this on-going concealment? The author, who himself
        enjoys having a drink, looks into the question why we drink at all, what
        alcohol does to us and to what extent the alcohol industry influences
        society and politics.</image:caption
