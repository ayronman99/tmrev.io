        >Bandung is frightened because of the youth who left his family to join
        Baracas. Baracas is a place where men are disillusioned by women formed
        by Agus (Ringgo Agus Rahman). They muster strength and unite feelings to
        hate women all over the world and on all the elements concerned with
        women. Agus is a former girlfriend of Sarah (Tika Bravani), who suddenly
        Sarah broke up their relationship. The resistance movement against
        Baracas accused the police and the city administration of deliberately
        allowing Baracas to flourish. That's why they are demos. Even Baracas
        got a physical attack. Resistance is also done by ex-girlfriend members
        of Baracas. They do various ways to change the way Baracas
        thinks.</image:caption
