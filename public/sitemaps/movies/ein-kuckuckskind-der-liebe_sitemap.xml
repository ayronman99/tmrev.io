        >Anabel (Lisa Martinek) apparently has everything a woman could want: a
        well-paid husband Dirk (Tim Bergmann), a nice apartment, good friends
        and an antique shop to keep her busy. The only thing missing is a child,
        but she can't have one because she accidentally finds out that her
        husband is sterile. She keeps her husband in the dark about her
        discovery of his shortcoming, who on the contrary assumes Anabel is
        incapable of conceiving. One day her pragmatic friend Lissi (Antje
        Schmidt) comes up with the idea that Anabel could get impregnated by
        another man and lie to her husband about the paternity of the
        child.</image:caption
