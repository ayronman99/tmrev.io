        >It's been a year since the Dogman terrorized this Midwestern community
        and nearly killed Hank Purvis. But now, things seem to have settled
        down. Everyone has gotten back to their routine. Hank still enjoys the
        outdoors and loves to hunt. He and his wife, Dorothy, continue to live
        on their family farm in the rural Midwest. The picturesque autumn
        woodlands are a wonderful place to be. But things are not well. Unseen
        in the nearby forest, are a litter of grown Dogman pups, embarking on
        their terrifying destiny, and standing over seven feet tall. They are a
        bad batch. They have to be stopped.</image:caption
