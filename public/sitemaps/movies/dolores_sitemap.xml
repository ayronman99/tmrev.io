        >Dolores Huerta bucks 1950s gender conventions by starting the country's
        first farm worker's union with fellow organizer Cesar Chavez. What
        starts out as a struggle for racial and labor justice, soon becomes a
        fight for gender equality within the same union she is eventually forced
        to leave. As she wrestles with raising 11 children, three marriages, and
        is nearly beaten to death by a San Francisco tactical police squad,
        Dolores emerges with a vision that connects her new found feminism with
        racial and class justice.</image:caption
