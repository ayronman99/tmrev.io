        >Taking place in 1992 during the era of grunge and outdoor gay cruising,
        we follow two strangers who meet while hiking a once-popular area for
        gay men known as Devil's Path. Two hikers have gone missing recently and
        with no leads or bodies and the area is now considered high risk and
        mostly closed off. The two strangers, Noah (Stephen Twardokus) and
        Patrick (JD Scalzo), are suddenly forced off the main trail after a
        confrontation with some suspicious hikers and soon find themselves
        running for their lives with nowhere to hide but in the
        trees.</image:caption
