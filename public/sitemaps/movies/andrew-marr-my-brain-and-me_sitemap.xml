        >After suffering a life-threatening stroke four years ago, the
        broadcaster and political journalist Andrew Marr quickly regained his
        ability to speak and was able to resume work. But he is still frustrated
        by lack of movement in his left arm, hand and leg. In this very intimate
        story, Andrew is on a mission to understand the mysteries of the human
        brain and to achieve further recovery. He meets some of Britain's
        million plus stroke survivors and travels the world in search of a
        miracle cure.</image:caption
