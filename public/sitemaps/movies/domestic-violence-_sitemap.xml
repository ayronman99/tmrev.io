        >The opening scene in this film is of an arrest in Hillsborough County
        Florida where a woman has scratched her husband while he was trying to
        restrain her from getting back in her car and leaving after an argument.
        The officers explain that she has committed a battery and thereby earned
        herself an inescapable arrest and overnight stay in jail because by law
        they have no discretion. This sets the stage for two hours of court
        proceedings before three different judges, each trying to apply the
        Florida domestic violence laws.</image:caption
