        >It is a time of chaos. Earth is no longer what it used to be. It has
        been infested with a bug like species called the Blue. Yuji Kaido, who
        has a mysterious disease, is put into suspended animation until a cure
        is found. When he wakes up Yuji learns that its been more than 20 years
        since he was put into suspended animation, and the world is now
        controled by these creatures. He joins a group of soldiers equipped with
        powerful mechas to fight against the Blue for hope of a better
        future.</image:caption
