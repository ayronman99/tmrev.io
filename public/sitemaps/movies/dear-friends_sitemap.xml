        >High school student Rina has a bad attitude and thinks that friends are
        something that you use when you need them. She doesn't have any real
        relationships and is not even on good terms with her parents. Rina is
        the clubbing queen and could get any guy she wants with her stunning
        looks. One day, Rina suddenly collapses and her world falls apart. She
        finds out that she has cancer. The only one who starts to support her is
        her classmate Maki. Maki tells that they were friends in primary school
        even though Rina doesn't remember. Maki wants to get close to Rina and
        help her like Rina had helped Maki when she had hard
        times.</image:caption
