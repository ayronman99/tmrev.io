        >Kanna Seto lost her childhood friend Haruta in a car accident when she
        was a freshman in high school. Carrying the emotional pain from that
        incident throughout her life, Kanna is still wounded as an adult. Kanna
        then meets Roku Akazawa, who also carries a painful experience from his
        past. When Roku was an elementary school student, a girl who was with
        him got into an accident and died. Because of that incident, Roku
        carries a heavy sense of guilt. When they meet, time, frozen since that
        day, begins to tick again.</image:caption
