        >A chronicle which provides a rare window into the international
        perception of the Iraq War, courtesy of Al Jazeera, the Arab world's
        most popular news outlet. Roundly criticized by Cabinet members and
        Pentagon officials for reporting with a pro-Iraqi bias, and strongly
        condemned for frequently airing civilian causalities as well as footage
        of American POWs, the station has revealed (and continues to show the
        world) everything about the Iraq War that the Bush administration did
        not want it to see.</image:caption
