        >Enter a story that will walk you through the lives of several different
        teenagers living in a small town. Discover how their decisions affect
        their own lives as well as the lives of those around them. The character

        stories that are all interlaced. From a group of friends breaking into a
        home, a mysterious box that must be guarded, to two girls waiting to
        hear from their crush, and a duel between musicians and more. These are
        only some of the different scenarios that will bring everyone to an
        unexpected ending.</image:caption
