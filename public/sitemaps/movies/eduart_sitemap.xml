        >Based on true events, a young man raised in a cruel and oppressive
        family environment, leaves Albania with the dream of becoming a rock
        star and living a better life. His reckless character and his youth
        passions lead him to commit a murder in Athens. Chased by everyone, even
        by his own self, he is imprisoned under the harshest conditions. With
        the help of a German doctor, he learns to feel sympathy for others and
        guilt for his crime. His deep remorse will lead him from darkness to
        light.</image:caption
