        >Sam is a former college football star whose chance to play in the NFL
        abruptly ends with a blown out knee. Seven years later, he finds himself
        alone, working a minimum wage job and weighing a deadly 413lbs. The time
        has come for some change! The time has come for some weight loss! Enter
        Cassie, a personal trainer who not only helps him lose weight but find
        love. Steering clear of the standard transformation formula seen on many
        current television shows such as, "Biggest Loser," Sam finds acceptance
        - and love - in unexpected places.</image:caption
