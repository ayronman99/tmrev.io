        >What is a griot? Historically, they are wandering African musicians
        considered to be a repository of the oral tradition. This film focuses
        on a master drummer, Adame Drama of Burkina Faso, a descendant of a long
        line of griots. He is a contemporary griot whose mission in life is to
        preserve his heritage and pass it on to the next generation. Resisting
        the lure of monetary rewards of an artistic career in Europe, Adame has
        elected to remain in his country and for forty years has pursued his
        music there. This colorful film is filled with music and dance as we see
        him perform on stage with other musicians and in celebrations on the
        streets and in courtyards. He reveals the secrets of his instrument and
        of his style of playing. Above all, he is a proud African who had
        rejected cultural colonialism in favor of maintaining his identity and
        that of his art.</image:caption
