        Everything bad and embarassing. But it only shows to other people; those
        who have sincerity. Jeong-nam delivers imitation goods and not the real
        ones. Jin sells herself and not flowers. In an alley in front of the
        cleaner's, Jin is waiting for someone while counting. However, no one is
        coming. Jin watches Jeong-nam who asks her what time it is several times
        but she's as cold as ice towards him as if she's never seen him before.
        Jeong-nam had saved Jin from her pimp who was beating her up in the back
        alley but still there's awkwardness between them. Then one day, Jin
        finds Jeong-nam abandoned in a pile of trash after being beat up by his
        clients, so he takes him home and they start living together and go on
        trips despite their bad start. They dream of a new life for each other.
        Will they get the life they want?</image:caption
