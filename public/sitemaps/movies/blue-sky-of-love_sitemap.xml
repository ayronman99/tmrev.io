        >Set in October 1976, during a revolutionary period in Thai history, the
        drama-comedy Blue Sky of Love tells a story of a university girl who
        wished to follow her ideology in working for people. She left her
        comfortably living in Bangkok to participate with the army of communism
        party located in remote forest. There, she met new companions who
        utterly have different point of view in their lives. Among these people,
        the girl found a guy who stands for his strong ideology, and she started
        to admire him.</image:caption
