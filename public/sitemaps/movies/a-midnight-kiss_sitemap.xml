        >With only one week to prepare, Lisa Patterson and her family of party
        planners are given the biggest job in their company’s history: a New
        Year’s Eve party for tech entrepreneur Megan Clark. But when her brother
        breaks his leg and her parents head off on a planned vacation, Lisa must
        reluctantly enlist the help of her brother’s visiting college buddy,
        David Campos, to help her pull off the event which just so happens to
        fall on her favorite day of the year. But what Lisa didn’t plan on was
        falling in love in the process.</image:caption
