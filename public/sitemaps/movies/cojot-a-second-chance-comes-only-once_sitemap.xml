        >Tells the virtually unknown story of a Parisian banker who risks his
        life, career and marriage to hunt down Gestapo commander Klaus Barbie
        and, only a few months later, plays a pivotal role in one of historys
        most daring hostage-rescue operations. Cojots journey started during
        World War II in Nazi-occupied France; hit a fork on the road in 1975 in
        Bolivia, when he faced his bitter past; reached a climax in Entebbe,
        Africa, a few months later, when he played a key role in one of the 20th
        centurys most daring hostage-rescue operations; and concluded back in
        France in the 1980s, when he again confronted Barbie this time, in
        court. Caught up in historys crosshairs, Cojot embodies the modern eras
        vital dilemmas how to lead a purposeful life and reconcile Western
        ideals of liberty, equality and justice with the bitter memories of WWII
        and the rise of global terrorism.</image:caption
