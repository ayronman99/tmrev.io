        >At 6'6" tall, clad in a tailored black suit and trademark black
        horn-rimmed glasses, Drew Hastings is a commanding presence on the
        stage. As he launches into his personal study of the complex human
        condition, the irregularities and uncertainties of misguided love, and
        his earnest attempts at farming, he is hilarious, insightful and deeply
        self-deprecating. Drew has been a regular guest on the syndicated Bob
        and Tom Radio Show and All-Star Theatre Tour, and he has years of stand
        up experience in clubs all across the country. His seasoned comedic
        talent pays off big in his first long awaited comedy special! Articulate
        yet acerbic, Drew Hastings is a raconteur with plenty of stories to
        tell. Irked &amp; Miffed will leave you anything but.</image:caption
