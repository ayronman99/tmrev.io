        >Follow Rhonda, a woman with a dark past and a mysterious power, as she
        is pursued by an unknown assailant after the death of her father. Aided

        dystopian metropolis populated by raiders, gangs, and the supernatural.

        friends and enemies, and searches for answers about this power, "The
        Ether", awakening within her.</image:caption
