        >As good as any Dickens novel, this is the triumphant and tragic story
        of the greatest architectural dynasty of the 19th century. Dan
        Cruickshank charts the rise of Sir George Gilbert Scott to the very
        heights of success, the fall of his son George Junior and the rise again
        of his grandson Giles. It is a story of architects bent on a mission to
        rebuild Britain. From the Romantic heights of the Midland Hotel at St
        Pancras station to the modern image of Bankside power station (now Tate
        Modern), this is the story of a family that shaped the Victorian age and
        left a giant legacy.</image:caption
