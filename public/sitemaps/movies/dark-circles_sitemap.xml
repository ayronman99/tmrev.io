        >When new parents Alex and Penny retreat from the city and move into a
        place outside town, the stress and massive sleep-deprivation caused by
        their infant has both of them seeing things in the house that may or may
        not exist. Persistent sightings of a strange woman has each of them
        wondering if they are suffering from hallucinations, or if their new
        home holds a dark, supernatural presence. As their fragile grasp on
        reality spirals into delirium, Alex and Penny find themselves nearly
        helpless to deal with the horrific truth of what is really going in this
        house.</image:caption
