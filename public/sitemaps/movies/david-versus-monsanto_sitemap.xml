        >Percy Schmeiser is a farmer from Bruno, Saskatchewan Canada whose
        Canola fields were contaminated with Monsanto's Round-Up Ready Canola.
        Monsanto's position was that it didn't matter whether Schmeiser knew or
        not that his canola field was contaminated with the Roundup Ready gene,
        or whether or not he took advantage of the technology (he didn't); that
        he must pay Monsanto their Technology Fee of $15./acre.</image:caption
