        >Near future, 2040. Eugene and Alexandra have been married for 20 years,
        their relationship is like a dried apricot. Divorce from them also does
        not work, because in the future, divorce is a very expensive service.

        on the very day 20 years ago, when the lover and young Zhenya proposed
        to the lovely Sasha. Now a couple from the future wants to separate
        themselves in their youth, but it won't be easy. The young will fight
        for their love.</image:caption
