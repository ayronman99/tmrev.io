        >Cruising is usually associated to dark, dirty and hidden places where
        men meet for casual sex. There is a lot of prejudice against cruising.
        In this film the participants burn sage to do a cleansing ritual in
        cruising places. They are male nature spirits dancing naked with
        erections turning the space into a playful cruising ground, where it is
        possible to build connections between body, heart, mind, soul and
        nature. When we connect to all of that we are instead of splitting off
        and losing ourselves, the cruising ground can turn into a sacred place
        where we can feel grounded, secure, in harmony with the others and the
        surroundings.</image:caption
