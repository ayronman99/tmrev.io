        >Sharron Holden is a loving mother, wife, and workaholic. She's on the
        verge of a huge promotion at work, but her husband feels as if she has
        given up on her family. While on vacation, she imagines that life would
        have been better if she didn't have kids so young. But when a man
        claiming to be Kris Kringle arrives, he shows her how empty life truly
        would have been without the love of her family.</image:caption
