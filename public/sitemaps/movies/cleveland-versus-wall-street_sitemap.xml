        >On 11th January 2008, hired by the City of Cleveland, lawyer Josh Cohen
        and his team filed a lawsuit against 21 banks, which they held
        accountable for the wave of foreclosures that had left their city in
        ruins. Since then, the bankers on Wall Street have been fighting by with
        all available means to avoid going to court. This film is the story of
        that trial. A film about a trial that may never be held but in which the
        facts, the participants and their testimonies are all real: the judge,
        lawyers, witnesses, even the members of the jury - asked to give their
        verdict - play their own roles. Step by step, one witness after another,
        the film takes apart, from a plain, human perspective, the mechanisms of
        subprime mortgage loans, a system that sent the world economy reeling. A
        trial for the sake of example, a universal fable about
        capitalism</image:caption
