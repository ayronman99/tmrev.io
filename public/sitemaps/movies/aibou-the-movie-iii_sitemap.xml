        >A news report circulates about a man who died after being kicked by a
        horse on a small island located 300km away from Tokyo. National Police
        Agency director Takeru Kanbe assigns Vice Director Mineaki Kai the task
        of making sure rumors surrounding the incident are fully investigated.
        Soon, partners Ukyo Sugishita and Tooru Kai are dispatched to the island
        to conduct the investigation. When Ukyo and Tooru arrive on the island,
        which is privately owned by a wealthy businessman, they discover a unit
        of former Self-Defense Forces personnel who have set up a small
        community as they participate in training exercises. While Ukyo
        initially expected to be investigating an accidental death, he quickly
        becomes convinced it was actually murder. However, when they finally
        manage to uncover conclusive evidence of this, the soldiers
        attack.</image:caption
