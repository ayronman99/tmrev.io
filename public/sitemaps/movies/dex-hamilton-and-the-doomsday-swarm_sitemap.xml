        >The most fearsome, destructive insect in the galaxy has come to Earth,
        and famous swashbuckling entomologist Dex Hamilton is on the case. But
        he's not trying to stop it. He's trying to save it - from the
        remorseless exterminator Hartley Hunter, whose life's mission is to see
        all bugs in the galaxy wiped out. It's a rollicking animated sci-fi
        adventure with legs as Dex Hamilton is all that stands between the
        forces of evil and the most incredible insect species the galaxy has
        ever known.</image:caption
