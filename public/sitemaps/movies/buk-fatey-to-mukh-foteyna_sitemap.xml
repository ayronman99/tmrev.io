        >Rimaan (Shakib Khan) is the son of a multimillionaire in Dhaka. He has
        a love interest in Suhana (Rumana), who has a friend, Tulip (Apu
        Biswas). Tulip's father (Shohel Rana) wants to get her married to her
        cousin (Misha Sawdagor), who is a rowdy, which she doesn't like. Tulip's
        paternal-grandfather bluffs to the family that she has already fallen in
        love with a guy in the city. Suhana helps Tulip by renting Rimaan as her
        would-be, just to let her escape the wedding situation for the time
        being. Just as things cool down, Tulip's suitor takes her away by force,
        only to be chased by Rimaan. Rimaan finally beats up her suitor into
        submission and leaves with her, but another problem arises when Rimaan
        has to decide between Suhana, whom he dated, and Tulip, who falls for
        him.</image:caption
