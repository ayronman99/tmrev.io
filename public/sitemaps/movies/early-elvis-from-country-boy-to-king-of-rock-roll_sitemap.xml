        >Elvis thought of himself as just a country boy, and maybe it was that
        innocent quality combined with a fantastic energy level that made him so
        special. From his first recordings on the Sun record label, people
        recognized that this is what legends are made of. In his personal
        appearances, all his magic was fulfilled. Elvis had moves on stage that
        were unique to him alone. The fantastic success Elvis achieved in his
        chart breaking record career and his followup personal appearance tours
        were just the tip of the iceberg. Hollywood beckoned, and stardom was
        immediate. Lines of admirers wrapped themselves around the block waiting
        to get into the local movie house just to see him, and in this
        retrospective, we look at these "Elvis starring vehicles" and
        immediately know why. This unique program encompasses all phases of this
        remarkable entertainer. You will see rare footage, film clips, stills,
        and information that will delight every trivia lover.</image:caption
