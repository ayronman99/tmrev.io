        >Initiated by the Hong Kong Performing Artists Association and the Hong
        Kong Film Workers Association, ten film companies in Hong Kong (China
        Star, Anle Film, Emperor Films, Oriental Films, Media Asia Films, Meiya
        Films, World Films, Shaw Brothers, Sun Entertainment Culture , Huanyu
        Film) and the Hong Kong Film Development Councilâ€™s "Film Production
        Financing Project". It tells about a quiet afternoon when the Gurney
        Hotel suddenly detected a suspected case. The epidemic prevention center
        ordered a total blockade. All guests staying in the hotel must accept
        Mandatory quarantine for 14 days. Everyone is isolated in the hotel, and
        the relationship between people is getting closer unconsciously.
        Everyone has lived through difficult times together, and learned to
        cherish what may be the last time to get along with each
        other.</image:caption
