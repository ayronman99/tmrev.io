        >Ako Togawa and her boyfriend Hiroki were enjoying their youth in high
        school. They visited their childhood friend Yoshio at his casting press
        factory. After the death of his father, Yoshio gave up high school but
        continued to study for college. Yoshio envied Hiroki for dating Ako
        because Ako was Yoshio's secret love since childhood. One day, three of
        them agreed to study together in Yoshio's room. While waiting for Hiroki
        who were coming late, Ako fell asleep. As he peeped at Ako's white
        panties, Yoshio lost control and took Ako. During her resistance, Ako
        hit her head and lost conscious. When she woke up, Ako's hands and feet
        were tied with rope. That was the beginning of her life as a pet of
        Yoshio. How long will the days of love, desire and confinement alone
        behind the door last...?</image:caption
