        >JW is serving hard time in prison and struggling to get back on an
        honest path. There are glimmers of hope in his life - some venture
        capitalists are interested in a new piece of trading software he's
        developed, and while behind bars he's made peace with an old enemy. This
        all proves to be an illusion. On leave from prison, and back in contact
        with his former gang, JW learns that once you've walked in the shoes of
        a criminal there just may be no going back.</image:caption
