        >Hard-working bakery owner Kate Holiday, has more cookie orders than she
        has time to fill this holiday season, and when her boyfriend suddenly
        breaks up with her, any shred of Christmas joy she was hanging onto,
        immediately disappears. After Kate hangs the last ornament on the tree
        and goes to bed, she awakens the next morning to a little bit of
        Christmas magic. She gets the surprise of her life when Chip, a handsome
        soldier who may or may not be the Nutcracker Prince from Tchaikovsky’s
        “The Nutcracker,” appears in her living room.</image:caption
