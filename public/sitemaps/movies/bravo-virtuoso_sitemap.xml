        >Alik, 25, has been raised by his grandfather, conductor of a renowned
        classical orchestra in post-Soviet Armenia where cultural institutions
        are failing and oligarchs allied with the mafia hold power. Alik, a
        clarinetist, is the virtuoso in this orchestra whose existence is
        seriously threatened when its key sponsor is murdered. One night, Alik
        comes into possession of a hired killer's mysterious telephone, which is
        used only to commission hits. Manipulated by a crook's daughter with
        whom he falls hopelessly in love and wishing to save the orchestra at
        all costs, Alik decides to take on the identity of the killer known as
        "The Virtuoso" and attempt to carry out his contracts. But Alik is a
        virtuoso musician, not a killer.</image:caption
