        >Deep Throat, a pornographic film directed by Gerard Damiano, a
        film-loving hairdresser, and starring Linda Lovelace, a shy girl
        manipulated by a controlling husband, was released in 1972 and divided
        audiences, who began to talk openly about sex, desire and female
        pleasure; but also about violence and abuse; and about pornography,
        until then an almost clandestine industry, as a revolutionary cultural
        phenomenon.</image:caption
