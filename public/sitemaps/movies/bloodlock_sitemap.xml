        >Christine and her husband Barry have bought an old fixer upper in a
        small town, using her recent inheritance, believing that fixing it up
        and a fresh start, will help her recover from a near nervous breakdown.
        Christine has invited her sister Lisa to move in with them unaware that
        she is having an affair with husband Barry. Barry, a police detective,
        only stays with Christine for her money and is looking a way to rid
        himself permanently of her. Lisa flirts with Barry under Christine?s
        nose delighting in the thrill of the possibility of being discovered.
        They find a secret room in the basement laundry with a heavy, titanium
        door with a cross and mystical writings, locked by an intricate
        mechanism. They joke about it but only as a way of coping with the
        mounting fear that it hides something horrible.</image:caption
