        >Coming home from his last deployment, Sgt. Major John Frost arrives a
        month early and heâ€™s happy to be home for Christmas. He finds his wife,
        Jill and son Jimmy too busy to give him the welcome he anticipated and
        in his absence, they have adopted a dog - a little dog named Charlie.
        John finds solace with the fellow vets at the Moose Lodge until Charlie
        finds Hank, a retired Vietnam vet, homeless and having suffered a heart
        attack. John finds his purpose as he rallies friends, family and
        community to build a new house for the vets and give them a warm
        Christmas Eve and a new start on civilian life.</image:caption
