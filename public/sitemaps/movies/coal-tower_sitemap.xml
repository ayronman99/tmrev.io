        >Jakub, a young, small time drug dealer, wakes up to find the police
        storming the apartment building while his parents are both away on
        holiday. After flushing all of his "secret stashes" in the toilet, he
        finds out they are actually there to investigate the death of the girl
        upstairs, a close childhood friend of his and the family. He slowly
        retraces the past week that she has been lying dead in her flat and
        remembers that he asked her to "receive a package" unbeknownst to her
        from his drug dealer, Pexeso.</image:caption
