        >21 key moments in the life of a couple in 21 sequence shots filmed in
        16 mm, shot entirely in Andalucia: this is the premise of the feature
        debut of Néstor Ruiz Medina, Goya nominee for his short film Baraka.
        María and Fer live an intense and complicit love, in an idyllic setting
        by the coast of Cádiz: a house with land, a vegetable garden with
        chickens, a rich social life, and time to spend with each other. Since
        money does matter in life, all this is sustained by exposing their sex
        life on OnlyFans, a social network with paid memberships, a thing they
        carry with ease and grace. What really lies behind all this, along with
        its consequences, is what we will see in these 21 moments of intimacy:
        the emotional flipside of OnlyFans brought by the cinema.</image:caption
