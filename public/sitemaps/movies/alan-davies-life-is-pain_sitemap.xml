        >Recorded live at Hammersmith Apollo the hilarious new show, Life Is
        Pain, covers every aspect of the modern condition. While famous as an
        actor – the eponymous hero in the BBC hit Jonathan Creek – and a
        household star for his role as Stephen Fry’s foil on QI, Alan was sorely
        missed from live stand-up. His first show back is a glorious insight
        into Alan’s unique worldview – growing up in the ‘70s, losing his mother
        as a little boy, the vagaries of Facebook, sex toys and being a father
        are just some of the subjects he tackles.</image:caption
