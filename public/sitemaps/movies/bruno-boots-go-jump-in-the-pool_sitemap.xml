        Bruno Walton and Melvin "Boots" O'Neal are the most infamous
        troublemakers at MacDonald Hall - a supposedly prestigious school for
        boys. Bruno, the brains behind the operation, has managed without fail
        to convince Boots to tag along on his countless prank operations whether
        it includes stealing a rival school's mascot, switching the school's
        flag or invading Miss Scrimmage's Academy for Girls Education and
        Awakening across the road. Despite their ongoing pranks, Bruno and Boots
        LOVE their school and are willing to do anything to protect
        it.</image:caption
