        >Korean newlyweds are on their honeymoon in Paris. Strolling in the
        Pigalle area, the young bride sees in a red dress in a store window and
        she enters the shop. Her husband goes to buy cigarettes while he waits
        for her. When the man comes back his wife has disappeared. Not speaking
        a word of French he desperately searches for her. A search that will
        turn into a free fall into a world ruled by illegality, prostitution,
        drugs, a universe with its own codes and punishments</image:caption
