        >Wannabe actor Joon-cheol is living with his girlfriend who wants to get
        married. He tries to convince her to get married after he's made his
        debut but she breaks up with him in the end and kicks him out.
        Joon-cheol has nowhere to go but a friend of his has to go on a business
        trip and asks him to take care of his pet cat. However, what's waiting
        for him is not a cat but a girl with aphasia. Joon-cheol quarrels with
        his friend about calling the cops and comes out of the house. He goes
        back to his girlfriend but she doesn't accept him so he starts living
        with the cat girl.</image:caption
