        >Vannina, a young filmmaker, starts writing a screenplay about the life
        of Beatrice Virga, an Italian actress and cinema icon who died at the
        beginning of the 1960s when she was thirty-four years old. To be closer
        to her subject, Vannina goes to Corsica to write, in a hotel where the
        actress often stayed. It is winter and Vannina seems to be alone,
        sharing the place with the hotel pianist. As the days go by, deeply
        buried secrets rise to the surface.</image:caption
