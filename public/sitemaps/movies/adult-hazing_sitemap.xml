        >Ji-seok's libido wanes whenever he stands in front of a woman. One day,
        while sleeping alone in his friend's house, drunk Hye-eun mistook
        Ji-seok for Dong-cheol and then ran off. Ji-seok spent the hot night
        first, and Dong-cheol directed and watched it. Hye-eun later became
        angry after learning that she was with Ji-seok, but she happened to know
        his problem. In the end, she continues the relationship to help
        Ji-seok.</image:caption
