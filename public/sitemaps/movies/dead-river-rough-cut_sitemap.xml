        >Bob Wagg and Walter Lane live in a tarpaper shack, hunting, fishing,
        trapping and logging with oxen. They prefer the sounds of the birds to
        the roar of highway traffic, and scorn the money-chasing of city life.
        Covering a period of four seasons in the remote backwoods of Maine, Dead
        River Rough Cut presents a revealing look at an individual way of life.
        Wagg and Lane earn a living and accept their isolation for the
        independence it allows them. But not everyone would want to draw water
        from a hole in the ice. They share their reflections about women,
        politics, taxes, the lone life and death.</image:caption
