        >Contemporary art has become a trend for young people in China. Young
        artists often organize activities in the form of art groups or small
        groups â€” but this is not only looked down on by the government, but is
        also subject to punishments and restrictions. This film documents a
        gathering of more than 200 artists in Nanjing, all from different
        regions of China, who to engage in a modern art activity titled "Bask in
        the sunshine."</image:caption
