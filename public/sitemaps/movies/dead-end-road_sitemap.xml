        >Detective Burt Williams has been on the trail of the infamous "Poe
        killer" for nearly three years. The most recent abduction of fashion
        model Heather Makepiece prompts state authorities to bring in the FBI.
        Burt's daughter Kris Williams, a homicide agent for the FBI, along with
        her partner Sean Michaels take over. Burt reluctantly steps down from
        the case and retires. For the next seven months the "Poe Killer"
        continues his murderous rampage, until Kris discovers that the killer
        uses internet chat rooms to seduce his prey. She logs in as Annabel Lee
        and sure enough, he contacts her. With the help of Larry the tech guy,
        she sets up a meeting at a nearby bowling alley. But, when things go
        wrong and Kris is abducted and her partner Sean is slaughtered, it
        becomes a race against time for Burt and ex-partner Grace Andrews to
        find Kris before she becomes the next victim of the "Poe
        Killer".</image:caption
