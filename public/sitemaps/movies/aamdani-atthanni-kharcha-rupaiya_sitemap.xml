        >Jhoomri and her husband, Bhimsha, move into a new neighbourhood. Their
        immediate neighbours are three squabbling couples, namely Vijay and
        Anjali who are newly married; Appu Khote and Vimla, who are married and
        have 4 children; and Ravi and Meena, who are also married and have one
        child. With their wages unable to keep up with inflation and high cost
        of living, unable to pay even rent to the landlord, B.K. Kakkad, the
        wives decide to seek employment to augment their income, with hilarious
        results from their spouses, who will go to any extent to keep their
        wives at home, even if means to bring a dancing girl home to cook and
        look after the children!!</image:caption
