        >Riding high on the success of both his hit sitcom "The Hughleys" and
        "The Original Kings of Comedy" tour, D.L. Hughley goes solo in this
        installment of the "Platinum Comedy" series. Taking on subjects such as
        poverty, racism and gender differences, Hughley keeps the audience
        doubled over with laughter with his pointed jabs and sly observations.
        Note: This unedited routine is aimed at adults and is not appropriate
        for children.</image:caption
