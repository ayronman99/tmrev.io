        >I'm Rich tells the story of three orphaned siblings; Yassan, Yassun and
        Yassin. As older brothers, Yassan and Yassun traded chickens in the
        market to support their family. While the youngest Yassin acts as the
        person in charge of household affairs. Funny incidents occurred when
        Yassin’s application to participate in the “I’m Rich” quiz show was
        accepted. Many obstacles and trials had to be faced by the three
        brothers. Can Yassan, Yassun and Yassin face all the obstacles? Did
        Yassin manage to take home the RM1 million cash offered to the sole
        winner of "Aku Kaya"?</image:caption
