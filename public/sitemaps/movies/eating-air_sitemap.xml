        >A romance between two opposites, Eating Air follows the lives of two
        teenagers during the hottest month in the history of Singapore. For Boy,
        breaking into bridal shops under the moonlight is as wildly exciting as
        Girl on her first motorcycle spin through the binding fluorescent
        tunnels of the CTE. About the joys and pangs of teenage love, Eating Air
        seeks the delirious madness that makes 18-year-olds invincible to low
        fuels, fists and oil-puddles on the road.</image:caption
