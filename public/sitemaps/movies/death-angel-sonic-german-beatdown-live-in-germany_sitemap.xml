        >Five years after the acclaimed comeback album "The Art Of Dying", and
        the following album “Killing Season”, the legendary and one of the most
        influential bands of the Bay Area Thrash Metal scene DEATH ANGEL will
        release a DVD with two full length concerts filmed in Germany. The DVD
        was filmed live at Rockhard Festival 2007 and in Adelsheim.in 2008. It
        contains some of the new Songs, two Clips and a lot of old DEATH ANGEL
        stuff which is still seriously cult! This is the first live DVD ever in
        the history of DEATH ANGEL and it also contains a Live CD. So, what to
        say more: Grab "Sonic German Beatdown" and see by yourself that DEATH
        ANGEL are more alive than ever before! It's just amazing…</image:caption
