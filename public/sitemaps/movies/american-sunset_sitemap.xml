        >On a trip back to Canada to celebrate their fifth wedding anniversary,
        Tom Marlow (Corey Haim) wakes to find his beloved wife missing. Their
        vacation home - now a crime scene - is now littered with clues to his
        wife's whereabouts. In order to ensure her safe return, Tom, now a
        stranger in the land of his birth is forced to cooperate with the
        practices of local authorities, the political rhetoric of the American
        Embassy and the unorthodox methods of a Private Investigator he hired to
        help him.</image:caption
