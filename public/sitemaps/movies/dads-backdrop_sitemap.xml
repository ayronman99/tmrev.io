        >Middle-aged pro wrestler Ushinosuke's wife passes away, and he and his
        son, Kazuo, move in with his father. His fellow wrestlers help them
        shift house and celebrate their new home, but in the midst of their
        revelry sits Kazuo with a pained look on his face. He hates pro
        wrestling with a passion and is embarrassed by his father who has made a
        heel turn in order to save the ailing wrestling organization he belongs
        to. He even keeps his dad's profession a secret from his new classmates.
        When Ushinosuke finds out how his son feels, he sets up an unusual death
        match with a karate champion in a bid for acceptance. He is knocked down
        several times, but each time manages to rise to his feet and inch
        towards the championship. Finally he manages to unleash his finishing
        move, a devastating backdrop, and achieves a miraculous upset victory
        with Kazuo watching on proudly.</image:caption
