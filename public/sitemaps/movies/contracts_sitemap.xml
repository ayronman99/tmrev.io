        >Anthony Lo is a killer for hire who grows weary of the game. But he
        knows he can’t put down his guns until he finds out who killed the woman
        he loved, fellow assassin Malice. All he has to go on is the code name
        Ghost and that they kill other killers. Marc Sullivan reaches out to
        him. Someone is killing his people and he believes it’s Ghost. Here’s
        his chance to get his revenge. However, in this line of work things are
        never what they seem and he’s soon caught in a web of deadly betrayals.
        Will Anthony avenge Malice? Or join her in death?</image:caption
