        >This program takes a track by track look at the making of the album. We
        speak to Joe Elliott, Rick Allen, Phil Collen, and Rick Savage who lead
        us through the original multitrack tapes. Joe and Phil play acoustic
        versions of 'Pour Some Sugar On Me" and "Hysteria," and Sav and Phil
        demonstrate riffs and licks from the songs, and explain the genesis of
        the songwriting. Features songs: Animal, Rocket, Love Bites, Hysteria,
        Women, Armageddon It, and Pour Some Sugar On Me. In this episode of the
        CLASSIC ALBUMS series, the surviving members of Def Leppard discuss the
        making of HYSTERIA as they sort through and explain the original
        multi-track tapes. In addition, some impromptu acoustic performances and
        musical demonstrations further dissect this classic album</image:caption
