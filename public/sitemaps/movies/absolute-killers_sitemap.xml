        >Johnny Graham, raised by the Torino crime family after the death of his
        parents, is repeatedly torn between loyalty to his adoptive family and
        his conscience. When Anthony Torino, the volatile heir-apparent, turns
        his deadly sights on the DA prosecuting him for the cold-blooded murder
        of his own cousin, Johnny is finally moved to act. Despite his role as
        family accountant, Johnny is quite the marksman. He convinces a
        reluctant Anthony into letting him eliminate DA Elizabeth Jones.
        Johnny's plan to simply warn her instead is thwarted by the arrival of a
        pair of Torino family goons sent to supervise his first hit. The ensuing
        shootout leaves Elizabeth wounded, one goon dead, and Johnny arrested.
        Johnny rolls on Anthony and enters the Witness Security
        Program.</image:caption
