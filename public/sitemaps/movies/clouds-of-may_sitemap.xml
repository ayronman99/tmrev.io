        back to his hometown to make a film using a cast of local people (based
        on the director Ceylan's first feature, Kasaba). While Muzaffer is
        around, his mother complains about simple health problems, his father is
        in a legal fight against the government for his land, his cousin leaves
        his job to help Muzaffer who promises to find him work in Istanbul, and
        his little cousin Ali tries to carry an egg in his pocket for forty days
        so that he'll get the watch of his dreams. In the meantime, they form
        the cast for Muzaffer's movie as well.</image:caption
