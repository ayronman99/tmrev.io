        >An executive manager, his wife and his family, at the point when his
        professional choices are about to overturn all their lives. Philippe
        Lemesle and his wife are separating, their love irretrievably damaged by
        pressures of work. A successful executive in industrial conglomerate,
        Philippe no longer knows how to respond to the contradictory demands of
        his bosses. Yesterday they wanted a manager, today an enforcer. Now he
        must decide what his life really means.</image:caption
