        >Love that lasts the longest is love that is never returned. Tristan
        knows this all too well. Despite what he may believe to be true, love
        seems to be just beyond his reach. Due to circumstances beyond his
        control, he meets Maya and discovers that she is the girl of his dreams.
        Lost in a world of isolation, Tristan is determined to be with Maya
        albeit their social and environmental differences. As their relationship
        blossoms into more, the world around Tristan begins to unravel as the
        past comes back to haunt him. Soon Tristan is faced with an important
        decision. Stay with Maya no matter the cost or take a different path and
        lose her forever.</image:caption
