        >Cris and Nico has just recently celebrated their first year anniversary
        and Cris has decided to introduce him to his mother who live just
        outside the city. It's been a year since Cris last visited his mother.
        He intends to bring along his bestfriend Chamy so that he can slowly
        hint to his mother that he is gay and that Nico is his partner. Cris
        thinks that his plan will be perfect. What he does not know is that his
        mother has discovered that her son is gay and has sought the help of her
        congregation to exorcise him on the night of his visit. What happens
        when three gay guys pretend to be straight and when a mother pretends
        she does not know? "Discreetly" ia a funny rendering of the challenges
        that every gay man faces not only with coming to terms with himself but
        with his family coming to terms with his gender.</image:caption
