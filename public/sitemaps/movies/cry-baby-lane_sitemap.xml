        >Andrew and his older brother Carl enjoy listening to ghost stories that
        the local undertaker tells them. One night he tells the tale of a local
        farmer whose wife gave birth to Siamese twins, one being good natured
        while the other was clearly evil. The farmer, ashamed of them, kept the
        twins locked in their room. Eventually the twins got sick and died
        together, so the farmer sawed them in half and buried the good twin in a
        cemetery and the bad twin in a shallow grave near the house. Later, Carl
        and his friends decide to hold a s√©ance in the cemetery where the good
        twin is buried, but they unintentionally awaken the bad twin instead.
        Gradually, he possesses nearly everyone in town and it is up to young
        Andrew to stop him.</image:caption
