        >Jake and Kyle are two boys who grew up together in rural Arizona. They
        are best friends, and they begin to take their relationship to the next
        level when Jake's father moves him and his family away to California.
        Jake and Kyle can never forget their strong emotional bond, and Jake,
        overworked and unattached, goes back to his hometown for the first time
        in 15 years to see Kyle and renew their special
        friendship.</image:caption
