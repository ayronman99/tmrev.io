        >Manuela de Fora, an elegant woman, widow of Pajares, lives with the
        sole obsession of marrying well her two daughters from her second
        marriage, Concha Blanca Jara and Amparo. She also has Juanito, son from
        her first marriage, but she despises him for wanting to be a merchant,
        like his father. Who really appreciates the laborious Juanito is his
        uncle Juan, a man of austere habits that blames his sister Manuela for
        wasting money to pretend being of high social position.</image:caption
