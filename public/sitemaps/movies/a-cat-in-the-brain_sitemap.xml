        >The master of Italian horror, Lucio Fulci, stars as... Lucio Fulci, a
        filmmaker with a reputation for gruesome horror films. His body of work
        has started to plague his mental state, and he is haunted by the
        grotesque set-pieces his mind has conjured up during his career. His
        psychiatrist, Egon Schwarz, uses a hypnotised Fulci as an avatar to
        carry out his own disturbed fantasies, in hopes of ruining the masterâ€™s
        reputation once and for all.</image:caption
