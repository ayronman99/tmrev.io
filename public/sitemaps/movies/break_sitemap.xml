        >Break is a 'rags to riches', feel good story. The film follows the
        exploits of Spencer Pryde (Sam Gittins), a gifted, inner-city kid,
        wasting his talents on petty crime. After witnessing the brutal murder
        of his pal Denis and finding himself in debt to a drug dealing thug
        named Ginger, it seems Spencer's life is spiraling out of control, until
        one day, a chance encounter with a Chinese stranger and former
        eight-ball pool champion named Vincent Quiang (David Yip) presents him
        with an opportunity to turn his life around. But in order to make a new
        life for himself, Spencer will first need to break away from peer
        pressure of his friends, his environment and all the negative influences
        of his current life.</image:caption
