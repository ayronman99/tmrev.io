        >Editing is more than just assembling shots in a certain order, it's an
        art form, and this documentary celebrates the craft and how it has grown
        and evolved through the history of the cinema. Edge Codes.com: The Art
        of Motion Picture Editing traces this story from the world of pioneering
        silent auteurs such as Georges Méliès and D.W. Griffith through the bold
        stylings of the masters of the French New Wave to the technical and
        creative innovations of films like The Matrix, Memento, and The Sixth
        Sense. Edge Codes.com includes interviews with noted directors George
        Lucas and Norman Jewison, as well as top editors Thelma Schoonmaker,
        Zach Staenberg, Dody Dorn, Andrew Mondshein, and many
        more.</image:caption
