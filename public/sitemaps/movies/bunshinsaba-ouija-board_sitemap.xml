        >Yu-jin and her blind mother move to a small village from Seoul. On her
        first day at the new school, Yu-jin gets picked on by her classmates.
        Along with other victims of hatred, Yu-jin puts a curse on the four
        girls tormenting them through a Ouija Board. On her second day at
        school, one of the spellbound bursts into flames and dies just as she
        sits down where Yu-jin used the board. Next day, another victim burns to
        death, and now the school is enclosed by horror.</image:caption
