        >Awara Paagal Deewana ((Hindi: आवारा पागल दीवाना), English: Wayward,
        Crazy, Insane) is a 2002 Bollywood action comedy directed by Vikram
        Bhatt. The film's music was composed by Anu Malik, and the lyrics by
        Sameer. Reduced to a henpecked husband, his dream of making it big and
        being independent in the USA, Dr. Anmol Acharya is, in short,
        disillusioned and sad. He is not alone, he has his father-in-law,
        Manilal in the same leaky boat with him. Then this family has a new
        neighbor, namely Gulu Gulab Khatri. They find out that he a crime lord
        from India, and has a price-tag of two crore rupees on his head. Anmol
        and Manilal's wife want their respective husbands to go to India and
        arrange to hand-over Khatri, so they can collect the dough. Anmol and
        Manilal do go to India, but things don't go well as planned, and the
        hapless duo end up as hostages by Chota Chatri and Yeda Anna, who have
        orders to kill Khatri, and anyone else who gets in their
        way.</image:caption
