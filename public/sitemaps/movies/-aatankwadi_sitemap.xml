        >The great Jageera, the most terrible of Pakistani Islamist terrorists
        wanted by the police of 21 countries, and his fine team of right-hand
        men, including the faithful Abdullah, threaten to kill the family of the
        Indian Prime Minister. The attempt fails thanks to the courage of doctor
        Suraj (Avinash Wadhavan), a successful seducer. Jageera's brother in
        charge of the operation is killed by the police. Jageera and his gang
        will then take Dr. Suraj and his wife hostage in their house. Game of
        power of influence and money, the tension rises dangerously between the
        4 walls.</image:caption
