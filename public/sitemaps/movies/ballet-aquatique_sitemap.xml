        >In one of his very last projects, Raul Ruiz celebrates the films of his
        historical predecessor Jean Painlevé, a documentary innovator whose work
        always blended science with surrealism. Ruiz and friends further perfect
        the art of mystification. Why it is so difficult to count fish in an
        aquarium? Ruiz, his loyal actor Melvil Poupaud and his producer François
        Margolin come up with a wide range of hypotheses. With their bone-dry
        wit, they keep up the tradition of the French pataphysics: the science
        of imaginary solutions. (IFFR)</image:caption
