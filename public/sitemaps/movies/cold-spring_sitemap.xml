        >Prompted by an almost fatal car accident, Sara and Roy, a married
        couple, decide to start a new life and move to the small town of Cold
        Spring. This incident also serves as a wakeup call for Roy who breaks
        off an affair he's been having with his sexy mistress, Diane. Just as
        they begin settling into their new life, Diane shows up in Cold Spring
        and declares that she cannot live without him and has just bought a
        house in Cold Spring to be near him.</image:caption
