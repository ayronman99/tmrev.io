        >Disgrace is the story of a South African professor of English who loses
        everything: his reputation, his job, his peace of mind, his good looks,
        his dreams of artistic success, and finally even his ability to protect
        his cherished daughter. After having an affair with a student, he moves
        to the Eastern Cape, where he gets caught up in a mess of post-apartheid
        politics.</image:caption
