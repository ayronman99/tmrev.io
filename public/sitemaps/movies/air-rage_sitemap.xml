        >When a Marine Colonel orders his men to massacre a village they were
        sent to rescue some hostages but when they found them dead they decide
        to get some payback. Upon returning to the States the Colonel would be
        court-martialed and made a plea agreement wherein all the blame is on
        him and his men would be discharged and receive any benefits they're
        entitled. But the General presiding over his trial chooses not to agree
        to the agreement and throws the book at the Colonel and has his men
        dishonorably discharged thus eliminating all their
        benefits.</image:caption
