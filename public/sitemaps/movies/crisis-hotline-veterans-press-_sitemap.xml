        >According to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, one veteran dies
        by suicide in America every 80 minutes. While only 1% of Americans has
        served in the military, former service members account for 20% of all
        suicides in the U.S. Based in Canandaigua, NY and open 24 hours a day,
        365 days a year, the Veterans Crisis Line receives more than 22,000
        calls each month from veterans of all conflicts who are struggling or
        contemplating suicide. This timely documentary spotlights the traumas
        endured by America’s veterans, as seen through the work of the hotline’s
        trained responders. CRISIS HOTLINE captures extremely private moments,
        where the professionals, many of whom are themselves veterans or
        veterans’ spouses, can often interrupt the thoughts and plans of
        suicidal callers to steer them out of crisis.</image:caption
