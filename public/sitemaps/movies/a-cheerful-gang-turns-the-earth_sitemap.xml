        >Four strangers (a verbose romantic, a human lie detector, an expert
        pickpocket, and a woman with a preternaturally precise sense of time)
        are brought together by chance when they inadvertently team up to thwart
        a bank robbery. Recognizing the potential of their combined talents,
        they decide to form a bank-robbing gang themselves, just for the fun and
        romance of it. Their heists are played out swiftly and coolly, less like
        robberies than performance art. Eventually, the foursome's good-natured
        crime streak is interrupted when a man from one of their pasts creates a
        whirlwind of extortion and double crossing.</image:caption
