        >As we hear the poetic expression of an ailing father who was once a
        writer, painter, and thinker, we witness the worldly voyage of his
        married daughter seriously and sincerely taking care of him. She remains
        persistently in guilt that if she had been bit cautious and had taken
        care of her father properly, he would have been mentally and physically
        sound. Very well supported by her husband, though he does get annoyed
        time to time, as suggested, she tries to re-introduce to her dad the old
        people and places he had always been connected to in the
        past.</image:caption
