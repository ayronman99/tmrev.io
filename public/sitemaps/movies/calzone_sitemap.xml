        >Short - A godfather in the Mafia comes to have dinner in a trendy
        Italian restaurant. Faithful to his customs, he orders a calzone. In his
        great surprise, he does not find egg there inside. Mad with rage, he
        sends his two right hands to settle the situation in the kitchen. Be
        terrorized, the chef and his dumb apprentice, they learn that the
        problem comes from the hen Nuggets which, victim of a depression,
        refuses to lay. Numbers of dance, theater, intimidation, everything is
        good to obtain the saving egg. - Cl√©ment Aubert, Fanny Deblock, Vincent
