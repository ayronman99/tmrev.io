        >A story set in a world before ours. A world in chaos where forces of
        good and evil fight and mingle. By doing so, it creates the chance to
        give birth to the new world. A couple of winged beings make love and fly
        away. They bear a child in an egg, and when the child opens its eyes
        they are immediately destroyed, one consumed by fire and the other by
        water. Mythical, elemental and mysterious, the world created by Tsuji is
        dangerous, menacing and suffuse with signs of apocalypse, but somehow
        simultaneously tender and compassionate. A Feather Stare at the Dark
        captures simple gestures and primal feelings and amplifies them,
        realising the non-verbal and non-literal with remarkable
        grace.</image:caption
