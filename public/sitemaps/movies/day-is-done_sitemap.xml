        >Day Is Done is a carnivalesque opus, a genre-smashing epic in which
        vampires, dancing Goths, hillbillies, mimes and demons come together in
        a kind of subversive musical theater/variety revue. Running over
        two-and-a-half hours, this riotous theatrical spectacle unfolds as a
        series of episodes that form a loose, fractured narrative. The video
        comprises parts 2 through 32 of Kelley's multi-faceted project
        Extracurricular Activity Projective Reconstructions, in which trauma,
        abuse and repressed memory are refracted through personal and
        mass-cultural experience. The source material is a series of high school
        yearbook photographs of "extracurricular activities," specifically those
        that represent what Kelley has termed "socially accepted rituals of
        deviance." Kelley then stages video narratives around these found
        images.</image:caption
