        >Lifestyle guru and romance expert, Joanna Moret, has developed a
        fool-proof strategy for ending holiday loneliness and it's all detailed
        in her best-selling book, The Love Audit. After appearing on a morning
        show, she is offered the biggest opportunity of her career—to throw the
        MacAllen Holiday Gala—and if all goes well she'll get her own TV show.
        Little do her fans, or the MacAllen's, know that she is newly single and
        can't seem to apply her principles to her own love life. Joanna asks the
        morning show producer, Ted to pretend they are a couple or risk being
        exposed as a fraud.</image:caption
