        >Jack is a children's author turned crime novelist whose detailed
        research into the lives of Victorian serial killers has turned him into
        a paranoid wreck, persecuted by the irrational fear of being murdered.
        When Jack is thrown a life-line by his long-suffering agent and a
        mysterious Hollywood executive takes a sudden and inexplicable interest
        in his script, what should be his big break rapidly turns into his big
        breakdown, as Jack is forced to confront his worst demons; among them
        his love life, his laundry and the origin of all fear.</image:caption
