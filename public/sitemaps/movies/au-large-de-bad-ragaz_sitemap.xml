        >Alex, a professional tourist guide, is asked to welcome Sacha,a young
        woman of Russian extraction. She has participated in a contest and,
        consequently, won a one-week stay in Geneva. From the outset, the young
        woman shakes up Alex's plans and drags him along with her through a
        risky and hazardous treasure-hunt at the confines of Eastern
        Switzerland. Wanted by the police and hunted down by the mafia, Alex and
        Sacha decide to shake off their pursuers by moving about more slowly
        than the others: they then advance through lakes and other roundabout
        ways. While Alex and Sacha sink deeply into an ever stranger
        Switzerland, they will observe, discover, oppose and finally love each
        other to the vanishing point.</image:caption
