        >One night in a small town in North Carolina, fate brings together three
        lives: an entertainment lawyer returning home to his dying mother after
        years in escape of his past, a woman trying to reclaim her supposed
        love, and a boy with a penchant for the sixth sense who struggles with
        the death of his father and overbearing love of his single mother. When
        the past and future suddenly bind these people together on a journey of
        need, forgiveness and discovery, they realize they've gained something
        when they least expected it</image:caption
