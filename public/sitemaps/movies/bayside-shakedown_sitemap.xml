        >Aoshima, a police detective working in the Bayside Precinct, is
        continually frustrated by the hierarchy and red tape that plague the
        system. His friend Muroi is climbing the ladder of the police
        bureaucracy. Muroi has made a pact with Aoshima that while Aoshima looks
        after the streets, Muroi would make life easier for the cops on the
        beat. One day in Bayside, a series of events turns the small station
        upside down. A corpse is found in the river, then the Police
        Commissioner is kidnapped, leading to the Metropolitian Police
        Department to take over the investigation which is led by Murai. Will he
        be true to his pact with Aoshima and co-operate with the local police?
        In the meantime, the murder investigation leads to a morbid web page and
        a deadly chat room in cyberspace...</image:caption
