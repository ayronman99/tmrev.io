        >Before the body-threatening antics of Jackass came crashing into public
        consciousness, there was Ontario's Ralph Zavadil, aka Cap'n Video, who
        cascaded off roofs into snowbanks, jumped off ladders into half-empty
        swimming pools, and drank eggs through his nostrils. Beauty Day is a
        rambunctious documentary about this irrepressible pioneer of
        local-access cable shenanigans who entertained and outraged viewers in
        the small city of St. Catharines-until a special Easter Show, featuring
        a fat rabbit and adorable puppies (none of which were hurt), got him
        kicked off the air for good. With a nod to Werner Herzog, Cheel follows
        the life and times of Cap'n Video and finds that the Cap'n is still
        quite a firecracker. Written by Laurence Kardish</image:caption
