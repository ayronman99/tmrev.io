        >Alain hopes to have a baby with his wife Anna. However, Anna believes
        she is destined to become a famous pianist rather than a housewife and
        mother. Everything changes when they adopt a female puppy named Bambou.
        After successfully passing an audition, Anna leaves on a concert tour
        with a world famous conductor. Being apart takes its toll on the couple
        and they decide to break up. Alain finds himself alone, without a wife
        or a baby--just a dog, that he is not sure he wants to
        keep.</image:caption
