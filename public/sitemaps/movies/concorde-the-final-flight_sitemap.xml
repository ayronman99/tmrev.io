        >British Airways retired its Concorde on 24th October, 2003, thus ending
        the era of champagne and caviar at Mach 2 forever. During a career
        spanning 27 years Concorde carried around 4 million people and embarked
        on 50,000 flights. Thanks to its instantly recognisable design and
        state-of-the-art engineering, the aircraft became a national treasure
        that still evokes passion and pride 10 years after its permanent
        grounding. This programme takes viewers onboard one of Concorde's final
        flights to experience the thrill of supersonic travel. We'll go in the
        airport lounges, onto the plane, behind the scenes and hear from key
        players like chief Concorde pilot Mike Bannister, head of menu
        development David Stockton and chief engineer Claude Freeman, who all
        ensured Concorde was the ultimate flying experience.</image:caption
