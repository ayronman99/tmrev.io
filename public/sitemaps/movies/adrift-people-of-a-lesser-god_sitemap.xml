        >ADRIFT- People of a Lesser God is the story of an incredible odyssey
        made by several-times Pulitzer Prize-nominated undercover reporter
        Dominique C. Mollard. In this gripping story, Mollard sails with 38
        African migrants, among them a five-month-old baby, out of West Africa
        on a quest to reach the golden shores of Europe. All aboard are packed
        together like sardines in a leaky fishing canoe as they set off under
        full moon on their harrowing journey. ADRIFT-People of a Lesser God
        captures the struggle of these desperate migrants as they brave their
        way across the cold Atlantic, risking their lives in search for a better
        future. â€”Ziad H. Hamzeh</image:caption
