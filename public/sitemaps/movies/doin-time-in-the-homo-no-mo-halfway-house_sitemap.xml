        >See for yourself what happens behind the doors of America's zaniest
        ex-gay residential program. Peterson Toscano presents his one-man
        comedy. Through seven characters Toscano takes you on a comic tour of
        the Homo No Mo Halfway House, a Christian residential 12-Step program
        that attempts to save men and women from the "evil snares of
        homosexuality" through bizarre rules, gender realignment, and brain
        numbing reconditioning. From the daily rap sessions on appropriate male
        dress to the surreal Family and Friends Weekend, prepare yourself for a
        rocky and raucous tour of the house, and see for yourself if our hero
        comes OUT alive! Based on Toscano's real life experience floundering in
        various Ex-gay ministries, he weaves together humor, program jargon and
        outrageous eye witness accounts to form a piece that is hilarious,
        poignant and inspirational. Having premiered the play in Memphis in
        2003, Toscano traveled for five years in North America and Europe
        presenting it hundreds of times.</image:caption
