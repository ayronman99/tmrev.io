        >This informative and shocking two-hour documentary reveals over fifteen
        years of research from the world's leading AIDS scientists and
        researchers who unveil the truth behind the controversy surrounding HIV.
        Through this discovery process information is uncovered about the lack
        of "real" science behind what is accepted as official science. We are
        given the opportunity to witness and view respected authorities who come
        forward to challenge many of the uncertainties and "truths" about AIDS.
        This documentary will challenge those who claim to have discovered the
        cause of AIDS and who then sold to the world a highly inconsistent test
        as the absolute indicator of a fatal disease. A timeline through AIDS
        history presents inaccurate statements, questionable scientific
        evidence, and no real answers from the billions of global dollars spent
        on research.</image:caption
