        >Something is very wrong in the Southwestern desert! It starts when
        rogue rattlesnakes attack two young boys, and it goes downhill from
        there. The local authorities summon herpetologist Dr. Tom Parkinson to
        investigate why the snakes are being such jerks. With the help of
        photographer and fledgling feminist Ann Bradley, the two of them embark
        on a haphazard and half-assed investigation â€“ and romance. The hunt
        leads them to a nearby army base and its uncooperative commanding
        officer, Colonel Stroud. But when marauding rattlers kill two soldiers,
        the medical officer on the base can no longer keep silent and reveals
        the terrible secret, unleashing a chain of events, which lead to all
        kinds of explodey 1976 action, putting an end to the deadly rattlers.
