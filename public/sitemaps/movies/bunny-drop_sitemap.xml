        >Daikichi learns that his recently deceased grandfather has an
        illegitimate daughter with an unknown mother. The girl's name is Rin and
        she is just 6 years old. Everybody in Daikichi's family looks at the
        girl as an embarrassment and wants no part of her. Daikichi, annoyed by
        his family's attitude, decides to raise Rin by himself. Even though
        Daikichi himself has no experience raising a child and is still single.
        The movie is based on Yumi Unita's popular manga series "Usagi
        Drop".</image:caption
