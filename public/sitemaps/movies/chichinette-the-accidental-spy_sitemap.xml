        >When it seems that all the stories about World War II have already been
        told, a new one is often found. Marthe Cohn is a French Jew, whose life
        resembles a real-world blockbuster. During the war, she took the cover
        name Chichinette, became a spy, and gathered intel that helped organize
        an important military operation. Chichinette suffered many losses during
        the war, having been born in a Jewish family in a small industrial town
        close to the border between France and Germany. Now Marthe is 98 years
        old. Despite her age, she is savvy in modern technology and loves
        traveling the globe - she is often invited to go abroad and tell the
        story of her military achievements.</image:caption
