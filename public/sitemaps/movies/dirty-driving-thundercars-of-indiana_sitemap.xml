        >Auto racing is an obsession in Anderson, Indiana. Even with local auto
        factories closing down and jobs being lost, the town's residents
        continue to flock to the local speedway every Friday night--and its
        drivers continue to pour their dwindling resources into their
        Thundercars. Emmy(R)-winning filmmaker Jon Alpert presents this look at
        this passion for racing in rust-belt America. Since the closing of a GM
        plant and the loss of 33,000 jobs, the once-thriving town of Anderson
        now stands witness to empty factories, shuttered stores and abandoned
        home--but also to packed houses at Anderson Speedway where people put
        their troubles on hold to watch the cacophony of screeching tires and
        crashing metal as drivers vie for Thundercar supremacy.</image:caption
