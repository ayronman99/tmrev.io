        >The human susceptibility to delusional thinking has, at least, this
        defining characteristic: easy to spot in others, hard to see in oneself.
        The filmmaker, racked by the inescapable observation that it is
        delusional thinking that is the common denominator driver of so many
        contemporary man-made disasters gins up a vehicle meant to ruthlessly
        uncover and expose his own particular brand of pathological believing.
        This film is about us. I believe its true. See the iron jaws of the
        mechanism at work as the filmmaker falls into the biggest and most
        obvious delusion of all: the belief that he can master his own delusions
        by making a film about them.</image:caption
