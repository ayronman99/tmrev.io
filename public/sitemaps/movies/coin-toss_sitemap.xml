        >In the best screwball comedy tradition, This award winning film tells
        the story of love and luck turning on the toss of a coin. Tom Benett is
        trying to do the right thing, but his good intentions keep getting
        derailed by his scheming fianc√© and a hustler who want his $350 million
        dollar lottery ticket. Mix in skulduggery with a stolen investment
        formula, a childhood sweetheart, and a couple of homicidal pensioners,
        and Tom has a long way to go before he learns that it's okay to lose
        once you've learned what's worth winning!</image:caption
