        >For the sommeliers, coffee has three flavors: bitter, sour and a bit of
        fragrant towards the end. Through the common element of this so
        evocative product, this movie tells three stories set in three very
        different parts of the world. In Belgium, during some riots, a precious
        coffeepot gets stolen from Hamed's shop. He'll decide, once discovers
        the identity of the thief, to take vengeance alone. In Italy, Renzo, a
        young Latte Art expert, is involved in a robbery in a coffee shop, but
        things don't go as planned. In China, Ren Fei, a brilliant manager,
        finds out that his factory risks destroying a valley in the Yunnan, the
        beautiful region on the border with Laos.</image:caption
