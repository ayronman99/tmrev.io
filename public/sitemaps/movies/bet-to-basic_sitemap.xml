        >Inferior gangster Flying Dragon has a bad habit of gambling, he thus
        offends the three great gamble deceivers. Luckily his younger cousin,
        Roy, who comes back from America is extraordinarily lucky, he can win
        every round of the game and saves Flying Dragon. Flying Dragon hence
        brings Roy to Mahjong casino to earn money for him. Roy observes the
        rivalry between two Mahjong geniuses Hua San Yuan and Ge He Qing by
        chance, he witnesses the fate of them - one turns to be insane and one
        becomes bankrupt, and decides not to snatch the reputation of "The King
        of Mahjong". Though Roy has no desire to seize the fame, his good luck
        elicits the worry of aggressive Mie Luo who then plans to harm
        Roy.</image:caption
