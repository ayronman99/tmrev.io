        >A Place Where There Are Moths depicts the conflict between drab
        concrete block apartment living and the natural environment in Japanese
        cities. The forces of nature are represented by the motif of a tree
        whose leaves metamorphose into orange moths and take over a middle-aged
        woman's apartment, pushing her room higher and higher within the
        building.</image:caption
