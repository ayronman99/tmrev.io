        >Devotion investigates the extremely complex and heirarchical
        relationships among a committed group of Japanese filmmakers who
        dedicated up to 30 years of their lives making films for one man-Ogawa
        Shinsuke. Members of Ogawa Pro filmed the student movement of the late
        60's; the fight by farmers to save their land from government
        confiscaton for the Narita airport at Sanrizuka; and the village life of
        a small farming community, Magino Village, in northern Japan. These
        heartbreaking and sometimes funny stories have never been told on film
        before. Rare footage, stills, and diaries with interviews with Oshima
        Nagisa, Hara Kazuo and Robert Kramer make this historical inquiry
        visually exciting as well as valuable.</image:caption
