        >Maradonna (Shanthnoo) is an aimless youngster who likes to waste his
        time doing practically nothing other than fooling around. For him
        everything in life is Oru Rasam (just fun). He likes to take the easy
        way out and lacks focus in his life. He is the only son of Joseph (Lalu
        Alex), a Banker and Mary (Ambika), who dotes on him. The only person who
        has a soft corner for him is the beautiful Sofia (Nithya Menon) who has
        a limp and is the daughter of a failed filmmaker, Kuruvilla
        (Vijayaraghavan). Maradonna messes up his life by getting into company
        of friends and starting an internet café that fails and to recoup his
        losses and attracted by ‘easy money’ he gets into drugs. Soon he is
        conned and loses everything after pledging his house to a ‘blade’
        moneylender (Salim Kumar).</image:caption
