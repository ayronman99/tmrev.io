        >The film begins in the 1980s Soviet Union. Two best friends, Orlov and
        Muravyev, are serving at the Black Sea Navy Base in Sevastopol, Crimea.
        Both fall in love with one beautiful girl Nelly, and their friendship
        suffers a first blow. Because she picks Muravyev, his friend Orlov
        struggles with an inferiority complex and becomes a secretive alcoholic.
        After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, both friends are
        transferred to the Northern Fleet on the Polar Ocean. One day their sub
        is performing a routine training. A disturbed WWII mine slowly moves on
        a collision course with the sub. A mighty blast knocks down everyone
        inside the wrecked sub, 72 meters below the sea level. Then ensues a
        nerve-racking struggle for survival.</image:caption
