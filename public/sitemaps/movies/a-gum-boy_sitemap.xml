        >Nobody in a class loves ‘Kuchao’ who cannot live without. . . gum. When
        all [his] classmates fly their balloons, he wouldn’t let his go. After
        school, on his way home, he gets to his own imaginary world with a
        bubble gum. His balloon turns to be a face and to many things as he
        chews [his] gum. His imagination doesn’t stop flying. Then comes a bird.
