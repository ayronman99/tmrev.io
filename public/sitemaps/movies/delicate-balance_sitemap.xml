        Three stories intertwined on three different continents. This film is a
        reflection on the path that the human race is taking, on its habits and
        its relationship with the world. It is a proposal for change, from the
        particular to the general. We will take this journey with the words of
        Jos√© Mujica, former President of the Oriental Republic of
        Uruguay.</image:caption
