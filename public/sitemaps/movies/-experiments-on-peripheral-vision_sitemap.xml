        >Surrounded as we are by the proliferation of photographic images, we
        sometimes confuse these images with the actual, embodied experience of
        seeing. In reality, only a small central portion of human vision is
        sharp like a photograph. Peripheral vision is blurry and indistinct, the
        realm of intuition. In a series of short, playful experiments, this film
        explores what can be seen from the corner of the eye, perversely pushing
        at the central rectangle of the film frame to see how far it can stretch
        to suggest what lies beyond it.</image:caption
