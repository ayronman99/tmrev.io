        >At her 70th birthday celebration, the aged mother of the Gu family
        suffers from a stroke, which precipitates her decline into dementia. Who
        will take care of her? The four brothers face crucial changes in their
        relationships to one another, as they deal with their own family
        problems. Their destinies, linked by love and challenged by questions
        and dilemmas, unfold over the course of the four seasons, as it would in
        an ancient Chinese scroll painting.</image:caption
