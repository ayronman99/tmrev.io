        >Shut inside their cars, two women face off in a silent duel that is
        fought out in the intimate violence of their stares. A wholly female
        duel punctuated by the refusal to drink, eat and sleep; more obstinate
        than the sun of Palermo and more stubborn than the ferocity of the men
        who surround them. For, as in every duel, it is a question of life or
        death... Itâ€™s a Sunday afternoon. The sirocco is blowing pitilessly in
        Palermo when Rosa and Clara lose their way in the streets of the city
        and end up in a sort of alley: Via Castellana Bandiera. At the same
        moment, another car driven by Samira, crammed with members of the
        Calafiore family, arrives from the opposite direction and enters the
        same street.</image:caption
