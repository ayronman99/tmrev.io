        >Rune, a middle aged working class man, has lost his wife, his dog and
        his job, and now the city management wants to dig up his lawn in order
        to provide broadband for the neighborhood. Unfortunately, Rune recently
        buried his dog close to the road, right where they are going to dig.
        It's all too much for him, so he stubbornly decides to stop the digging,
        even if he has to sleep on the lawn.</image:caption
