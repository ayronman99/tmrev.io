        >Esprit de bi√®re (Beer) is a kind of attempt on an archaeological
        liquid, mixing the skills of playing truant and the quest for oneself.
        It makes its own investigation around this gol den drink as a police
        officer would do around some trivial event. Beer is first analysed as a
        substanc e, as a matter (real, chemical, physical,...). Then its own
        cycle will be careful ly studied. The Cycles reach every men in their
        wishs to create links and exchanges. The Cycles remind us that even beer
        can be a matter to think about.</image:caption
