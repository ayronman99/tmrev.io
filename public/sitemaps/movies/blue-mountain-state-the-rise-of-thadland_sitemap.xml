        >With Blue Mountain State football star Thad Castle recently signing a
        multi-million dollar NFL contract, his teammates and college life seem
        like a distant memory. However, when a new school dean threatens to
        clean up the BMS image by auctioning off the infamous Goat House, Alex,
        Sammy and the boys must find a way to convince him to get involved.
        Despite his new fortune and fame, there is one small favor that Thad
        needs done before he saves the day: the biggest booze-and-sloot fest in
        BMS history. Welcome to Thadland!</image:caption
