        >A desperate cop on the edge is obsessed over the fact that his
        beautiful but desperate wife is having an affair. At the same time, he
        tracks a desperately shrewd bank robber who is falling in love with a
        desperately obsessed woman whose life he just saved from suicide. As if
        that's not enough, he is also being blackmailed by two desperately
        unhinged street criminals who will stop at nothing to get their money.
        Time is running out for all of them as their worlds collide in in this
        intensely unique and desperately compelling and unpredictable
