        >David's Lab: Last Signs of Life is a 2019 short film. Created to mark
        the two-year anniversary of Alien: Covenant's home video release, the
        film is a sequel to the movie in which a Weyland-Yutani team arrives to
        investigate David's laboratory on Planet 4. One of the explorers enters
        David's laboratory to document the rogue synthetic's scientific
        discoveries. After carefully recording the specimens and records within
        the lab, including dissected Neomorphs and a vial of black liquid, he
        sets up his camera to analyze an egg-like object in one corner of the
        room while he continues his visual examination of the room. As the
        analysis continues, the Egg begins to show signs of life.</image:caption
