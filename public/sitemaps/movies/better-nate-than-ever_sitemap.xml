        >13-year-old Nate Foster has big Broadway dreams but there’s only one
        problem — he can’t even land a part in the school play. When his parents
        leave town, Nate and his best friend Libby sneak off to the Big Apple
        for a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to prove everyone wrong. A chance
        encounter with Nate’s long-lost Aunt Heidi turns his journey
        upside-down, and together they must learn that life’s greatest
        adventures are only as big as your dreams.</image:caption
