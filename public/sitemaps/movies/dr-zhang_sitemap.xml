        >The protagonist of the film "Dr. Zhang" often appears in various media.
        After being forced to drop out of school during the Cultural Revolution
        in 1966, he studied by himself in a factory in Chongqing for 17 years,
        and attended the "Foreign Language Department of Sichuan University" in
        Chengdu for 17 years, in order to realize his childhood dream of "going
        to Russia as a translator". During this period, he struggled to make a
        living by cleaning the university cafeteria, and lived in a hut with
        limestone under the stands of the school playground. In 2002, the
        "Sichuan Provincial Department of Agriculture" began to select some
        Russian-speaking students in the "Sichuan University Foreign Languages
        ​​Department" to go to Russia to do translations in the form of labor
        export. "Dr. Zhang", who is almost 50 years old, began to contact the
        "Sichuan Provincial Department of Agriculture" after hearing the
        news.</image:caption
