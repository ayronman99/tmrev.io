        >A decade after An Inconvenient Truth brought climate change into the
        heart of popular culture comes the riveting and rousing follow-up that
        shows just how close we are to a real energy revolution. Vice President
        Al Gore continues his tireless fight, traveling around the world
        training an army of climate champions and influencing international
        climate policy. Cameras follow him behind the scenes—in moments private
        and public, funny and poignant—as he pursues the empowering notion that
        while the stakes have never been higher, the perils of climate change
        can be overcome with human ingenuity and passion.</image:caption
