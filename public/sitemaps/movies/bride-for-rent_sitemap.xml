        >On the eve of his 25th birthday, the day he’s set to receive money from
        his trust fund, Rocco (Xian Lim) parties, gets drunk and loses all his
        money on a poker match. His dilemma: He has to produce the amount,
        otherwise he will lose the client he needs to defeat his father’s TV
        commercial production company. Meanwhile, Rocky (Kim Chiu) also needs
        money to pay the rent, otherwise her family will be homeless. There’s
        only one way for Rocco to be able to get money from his trust fund:
        Fulfill the conditions set by his grandmother and that is to get
        married. Rocky agrees to act as Rocco’s pseudo wife in exchange for a
        “talent fee.” They seal the deal. As they live like a married couple,
        Rocco and Rocky face one problem after another, forcing them with no
        alternative but to reconcile their differences and work with each other.
        Complication arises when they start to feel for each other, with their
        bond getting closer.</image:caption
