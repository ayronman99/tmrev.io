        >In 2008, a real-life mystery began to unfold when a real estate company
        (name withheld by request) discovered video footage shot in one of its
        vacant properties. The tapes were acquired by local documentary
        filmmakers Jarrod Rogan and Haman Movafagh, who began piecing together a
        series of bizarre instances recorded by a man living in the house.
        Apparently waiting for his wife and daughter to join him from out of
        state, the man began documenting strange activity that kept him from
        sleeping for days on end. The eerie recordings have become the subject
        of much controversy among paranormal investigators, and are finally
        being released to the general public. This first documentary from Son of
        Jason Films challenges audiences to explain what happened in the house
        on Briar Lane.</image:caption
