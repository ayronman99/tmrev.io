        >One year on: the Japanese tsunami through the eyes of its youngest
        survivors. On March 11, 2011 Japan was hit by the greatest tsunami in a
        thousand years. Through compelling testimony from 7-10-year-old
        survivors, the film reveals how the deadly wave and the Fukushima
        nuclear accident have changed children's lives forever. The story
        unfolds at two key locations: a primary school where 74 children were
        killed by the tsunami; and a school close to the Fukushima nuclear
        plant, attended by children evacuated from the nuclear exclusion zone.
        Radiation and its possible long-term effects are a constant worry for
        parents and children who choose to remain in Fukushima. Many parents
        have placed severe restrictions on where their children can go, how they
        dress and what they can eat and drink.</image:caption
