        >Correspondent: Gun Traffic highlights a worrying lack of control over
        arms dealing. The programme discovers a new twist: guns are now being
        made specifically for criminal groups around Europe, including Britain.
        The world's attention may be focused on nuclear, biological and chemical
        weapons in countries such as Iraq and North Korea. But gun trafficking
        is still growing and gun crime in Britain alone has doubled in the last
        10 years. Are illegally traded guns the real weapons of mass
        destruction?</image:caption
