        >Katrin and Jürgen spend their holidays in Corsica. Katrin is in her
        mid-thirties, working as a tracer at Jürgen’s company who suddenly
        remembers he’s married – but not with Kathrin. So they decide to end
        their vacation earlier than they had planned. Virtually a second before
        they start to drive back to the airport, Katrin takes her belongings out
        of Jürgen’s car again and lets him go. Now being alone for the remaining
        days of her vacation, Katrin finds herself more and more bewildered by
        the things that happened to her.</image:caption
