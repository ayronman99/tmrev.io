        >Suraj has everything any young man would kill forâ€“an MBA, a well-paid
        job and an offer from the UK. But his dream is to become a filmmaker,
        and so he says goodbye to his career. Disowned by his family and
        friends, Suraj starts out at the bottom, pasting movie posters on walls
        and also faces rejection from the industry as well. This movie follows
        his journey from being an MBA to a filmmaker.</image:caption
