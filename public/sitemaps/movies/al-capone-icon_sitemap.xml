        >Al Capone - The quintessential self-made American man, ruthless killer,
        or both? To this day we are fascinated with this celebrity gangster.
        Americans love a bad boy; a tragic anti-hero. Al Capone is one of the
        originals, one of the most notorious bootleggers and gangsters of the
        twentieth century, believed to have personally murdered dozens of people
        and ordered the killing of hundreds of others. But thatâ€™s only one side
        of this complicated man. He was also a hugely popular public figure,
        dynamic and charismatic; he opened one of the nation's first soup
        kitchens, and was a devoted patron and guardian of jazz, giving African
        American musicians opportunities that they would otherwise never have
        had. So what made him a crime boss instead of a powerful
        politician?</image:caption
