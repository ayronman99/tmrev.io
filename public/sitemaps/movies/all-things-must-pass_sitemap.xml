        >Established in 1960, Tower Records was once a retail powerhouse with
        two hundred stores, in thirty countries, on five continents. From humble
        beginnings in a small-town drugstore, Tower Records eventually became
        the heart and soul of the music world, and a powerful force in the music
        industry. In 1999, Tower Records made $1 billion. In 2006, the company
        filed for bankruptcy. What went wrong? Everyone thinks they know what
        killed Tower Records: The Internet. But that's not the story. All Things
        Must Pass is a feature documentary film examining this iconic company's
        explosive trajectory, tragic demise, and legacy forged by its rebellious
        founder, Russ Solomon.</image:caption
