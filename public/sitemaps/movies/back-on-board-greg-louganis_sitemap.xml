        Four-time Olympic champion Greg Louganis has faced more than his share
        of challenges. In 2011, he is far from the public eye and struggling to
        pay his mortgage. Now, the openly gay, HIV+ world-class athlete returns
        to diving to mentor the USA Olympic hopefuls. This may be his best
        chance to regain the notoriety -- and financial stability -- he enjoyed
        at the height of his career.</image:caption
