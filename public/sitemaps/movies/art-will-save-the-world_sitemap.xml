        >Failed pop star. The soul of The Auteurs and Black Box Recorder
        reconstructs the purgatory of his career in a hilarious testimony that
        craps on every aspect of the pop music business. Those on the prowl for
        public relations and commercial potential have come to the wrong place.
        Haines is a notorious party-pooper, a wet blanket at awards ceremonies,
        and a sourpuss-that-sulks-in-the-corner. To relate his tragic-comic
        saga, director Niall McCann organizes a perfidious puzzle filled with
        talking heads: Jarvis Cocker, Stewart Home, David Peace… (or, as Haines
        puts it: “people who pretend they have met me”), unforgettable quips by
        the disgusted composer (“To hell with the common people”, “Britpop never
        existed”), and a script that resembles Winterbottom gone punk: actors
        that aspire to walk in Haines’ shoes, frozen images, surprising turns,
        and historical tiffs.</image:caption
