        >In this one-hour special, Alan and Denise Jackson share stories and
        memories of Christmas holidays spent with their family. Jackson also
        takes the stage at the Grand Ole Opry House in Nashville for a special
        concert of songs from his latest Arista album, Let It Be Christmas, with
        some help from Denise and their three daughters. Backed up by
        Nashville's Belmont University Choir and W.O. Smith Children's Choir,
        Jackson performs holiday classics including "Have Yourself a Merry
        Little Christmas," "Winter Wonderland," "Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town,"
        "The Christmas Song," "Silent Night," "Jingle Bells," "O' Come All Ye
        Faithful" and "Away in a Manger." He also performs a new self-penned
        song, "Let It Be Christmas."</image:caption
