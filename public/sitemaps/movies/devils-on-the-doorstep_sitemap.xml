        >During the Japanese occupation of China, two prisoners are dumped in a
        peasant's home in a small town. The owner is bullied into keeping the
        prisoners until the next New Year, at which time they will be collected.
        The village leaders convene to interrogate the prisoners. The
        townspeople then struggle to accommodate the prisoners. One is a
        bellicose Japanese nationalist, the other a nervous translator. Will the
        townspeople manage to keep the prisoners until the New
        Year?</image:caption
