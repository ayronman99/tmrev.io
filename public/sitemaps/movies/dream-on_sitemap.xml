        >The course of true love does not run smoothly for two young lads at
        Norman's Cozy campsite on the Welsh coast in the mid 80s. Two English
        holiday-makers, Paul, an innocent northerner from Rochdale, and George,
        a jack the lad, nervy young man from London meet up. Paul has come on
        holiday with his domineering mum Denise and her attempts to control him,
        though comic, throw him further into thrall with George. Both teenagers
        dream of escape but their dreams go through many ups and downs in the
        course of 'Dream On'. Based on the play by Lloyd
        Eyre-Morgan.</image:caption
