        >On a rugged asteroid mining colony, few of the toiling workers are
        aware that their town drunk was ever anything but an interplanetary
        derelict. But when the miners open a fissure into the home of a horde of
        deadly alien insects, his true identity is exposed. He is space
        adventurer Adam Strange, whose heroic backstory is played out in
        flashbacks as he struggles to save the very people who have scorned him
        for so long.</image:caption
