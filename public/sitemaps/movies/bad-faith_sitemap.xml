        >A disturbed woman and a violent lunatic walk the same path in this
        thriller from Swedish director Kristian Petri. Monia is a businesswoman
        who has been hired to work for a large corporation based in Gothenburg.
        One evening, while having drinks with her colleagues, Monia steps
        outside for some air and she happens upon a man who has been brutally
        stabbed by a serial killer on the loose. Monia, who feels a curious
        emotional distance from the world around her, isn't sure what to make of
        this incident at first, but she can't get the violent image out of her
        mind, and over the next several days she keeps stumbling upon victims of
        the killer's handiwork. No one finds any of this remarkable besides her
        friend Frank, but in time she begins crossing paths with a curious man
        who seems to appear at the same crimes scenes she
        observes.</image:caption
