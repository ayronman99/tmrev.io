        >Annan Thambi is the story of twin brothers, Appu and Achu. Their father
        Ravunni, a ballet artist, separates them due to sibling rivalry, and
        Appu is sent to live with relatives in Pollachi. He grows up to be a
        lovable thug who falls for Thenmozhy, while Achu marries Lakshmi. But
        soon major misunderstandings created by their enemies crop up and the
        brothers are baying for each other's blood. Just before the climax, they
        come to the realization that others were behind their enmity, so they
        patch up their differences and take on their foes.</image:caption
