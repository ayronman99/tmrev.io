        >Going from 0 to 150 mph in three seconds, withstanding three Gs of
        force, and taking off from what's often called "the most dangerous place
        on the planet" are just parts of everyday life for an aircraft carrier
        pilot-and it's no different for the crew aboard the USS Enterprise.
        After being stationed in the Middle East for a year, these pilots have
        seen heavy action in Afghanistan and Iraq. Now, finally, they're
        returning home. With amazing personal stories and real-time footage from
        missions, this is an exciting insider's peek at life onboard a wartime
        aircraft carrier.</image:caption
