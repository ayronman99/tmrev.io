        >2 Dudes and a Dream is as visually compelling as it is sardonically
        hilarious. Ripe with parody and satire the film taps into the spirit of
        independent cinema coupled with studio accessibility. This film is
        intently accessible to a broad demographic ranging from 15 to 45
        saturated with pop culture and sophisticated comedic timing. There is an
        eclectic spectrum of farcical wit and situational comedy. This
        hyper-realized piece is cinematically shot in the essence of a stylized
        drama with dark comedic undertones all the while maintaining the light
        hearted nature of the plot. This hilarious parody is engineered to
        enthrall those prone to MTV and those prone to CNN, giving the profit
        margin and box office potential the ability to thrive. This film truly
        has the potential to become a cult classic yet compete directly with any
        studio comedy released.</image:caption
