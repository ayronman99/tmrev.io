        >It has been a quarter of a century since a little-known sports reporter
        was given his own radio chat show by the BBC. Two radio series, five TV
        series, four specials, two books and one movie later, Alan Partridge has
        an unrivalled place in the comedy pantheon. To celebrate Alanâ€™s return
        to his rightful home at the BBC in 2018, this retrospective documentary
        will look back at his journey from broadcaster caricature to the
        award-winning study of complexity and pathos that he has
        become.</image:caption
