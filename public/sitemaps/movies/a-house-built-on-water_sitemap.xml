        >Director Bahman Farmanara's second film following a 20-year exile from
        his native Iran depicts the spiritual crisis of a middle-aged man. In
        the film's dreamlike opening scene, Dr. Reza Sepidbakht (Reza Kianian),
        a well-off Tehran gynecologist, thinks he runs over an angel while
        driving home at night with a call girl. The next morning at the hospital
        where he works, he is shown a comatose boy who is famous for having
        memorized the entire Koran. These two events cause him to rethink his
        cynical outlook on life and his relationships with his elderly father,
        wayward son, and the women he has mistreated since becoming estranged
        from his wife. When the boy awakens from his coma, Dr. Sepidbakht begins
        to look to him for answers.</image:caption
