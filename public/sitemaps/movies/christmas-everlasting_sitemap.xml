        >Christmas is fast approaching and years of long workdays employed at
        New York’s top corporate law firm are about to pay off now that Lucy
        Toomey will be made partner after the New Year. However, when Alice, her
        older sister with special needs, unexpectedly passes away, Lucy returns
        back to Nilson’s Bay, Wis., to attend the funeral and handle her estate.
        While Lucy dreads returning to her childhood home, she also feels real
        sorrow that she was too busy to take her sister’s last call. Once back
        in Nilson’s Bay, Lucy meets Peter, her old high school sweetheart and
        Alice’s former attorney, who informs her of the terms of Alice’s
        eccentric will that states in order for Lucy to inherit the family home,
        she must live there for 30 days through the holidays.</image:caption
