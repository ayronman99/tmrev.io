        >(Long Synopsis) "In this laugh-out-loud, satirical comedy, Tripp Bailey
        (Marc Evan Johnson, Transformers) is a washed-up journalist who longs to
        be a high-profile, hard-hitting investigative reporter. But he has a
        plan … a plot to infiltrate and debunk Pyrasphere, Hollywood’s
        fastest-growing, new-age religion! Armed with only “The Truth”, he
        drafts his brother-in-law (Matt Price, TV’s Men of a Certain Age, Evan
        Almighty, Man on the Moon), a wedding/bar mitzvah videographer, and sets
        out to make his name. Under the leadership of glamorous, fame-seeking
        guru Gossamyrhh (Maggie Rowe, Ocean’s Thirteen, Fun With Dick and Jane),
        the duo encounters a wildly colorful collection of cultists, including
        his ex-wife (Amy Stiller, Tropic Thunder, Zoolander, The Cable Guy). But
        is Gossamyrhh’s philosophy actually genuine? Can Tripp really have it
        all through enlightenment … or is it a sham and part of a not-so-divine
        plan?</image:caption
