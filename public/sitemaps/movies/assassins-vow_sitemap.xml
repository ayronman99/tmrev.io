        >Set in the crime underworld of South Florida, Jacqueline is used as a
        pawn by her Miami crime boss father Jimmy Bombay. To expand his crime
        empire and join forces with an international drug cartel, Jimmy has
        arranged for Jacqueline to marry Dante Calivari, the son of a foreign
        drug lord. As Jacqueline fights for her freedom, her only solace is
        found in the counsel of a priest. But in this world of lies and
        deception, all is not as it seems as a journey down the aisle turns
        deadly.</image:caption
