        >The film follows Mr. Shi, a retired widower from Beijing. When his only
        daughter, Yilan, who lives in Spokane, Washington and works as a
        librarian, gets divorced, he decides to visit her to help her heal.
        However, Yilan is not interested. She tries keeping an emotional
        distance but when this finally fails she begins physically avoiding her
        father. He confronts her about an affair with a married Russian man and
        she, in turn, lets loose about all the gossip she'd heard as a young
        girl about his alleged affair with a female colleague back in
        China.</image:caption
