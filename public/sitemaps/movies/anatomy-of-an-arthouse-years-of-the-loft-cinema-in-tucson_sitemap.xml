        >Anatomy of an Arthouse: 50 Years of The Loft Cinema in Tucson is a
        short documentary film about The Loft Cinema, one of the countryâ€™s
        longest-running independent cinemas. As told by the people who made it
        happen - with its transition from screening X-rated adult films to
        showcasing acclaimed art films and repertory classics in 1972, its 1991
        move from a small church on Fremont and 6th Street to its current
        location on Speedway Boulevard, its longest run of Rocky Horror in
        America, to the ups and downs of the independent film exhibition world
        over the last 50 years.</image:caption
