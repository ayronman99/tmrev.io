        >Nicolas, an aimless adolescent who hasn't yet found his way in life
        leaves his grandparent's home, hitchhikes to a small town, and
        befriends, Charly an outspoken and slightly older prostitute, a
        red-headed beauty who appears to ply her trade in the same no-nonsense
        way she clears the breakfast dishes. She seems to find something
        endearing about Nicolas' mussed hair and dopey face, so she puts him up
        in the teeny trailer home that she maintains with such hilarious
        fussiness. As their unusual domestic arrangement evolves, each stumbles
        vulnerably into new emotional territory.</image:caption
