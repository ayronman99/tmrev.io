        >Skeeter Freeman is struggling in a sea of boiled peanuts and debt. Only
        two things keep him from becoming an AWM - his upcoming nuptials, and
        his two best friends. Walt - a boiled peanut connoisseur- and Floyd -a
        whorticultural engineer- When a horrifically funny event ruins his
        wedding - Skeeter goes on a journey to meet his idol, Bulldog Hays, but
        when Bulldog turns out to be nothing like he imagined, Skeeter must rely
        on himself, a limited supply of moonshine, broken shotguns, loose women,
        cheap drugs and his two redneck friends to fulfill his
        dream!</image:caption
