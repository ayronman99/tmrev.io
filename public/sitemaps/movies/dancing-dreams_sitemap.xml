        >The dance performance “Kontakthof” bears the unmistakable signature of
        Pina Bausch: it deals with forms of human contact, encounters between
        the sexes, and the search for love and tenderness, with all its
        attendant anxieties, yearnings and doubts. It is a dance about feelings,
        which always pose a big challenge – particularly for young people.
        Teenagers from more than eleven schools in Wuppertal went on an
        emotional journey that lasted almost a year. Every Saturday, forty
        students aged between fourteen and eighteen years of age took part in
        rehearsals that were led by Bausch-dancers Jo-Ann Endicott and Bénédicte
        Billiet and intensely supervised by Pina Bausch herself.</image:caption
