        >A true pioneer in audio exploration and psycho-acoustics, Delia
        Derbyshire conceived one of the most familiar compositions in science
        fiction, the Doctor Who theme, while working in a BBC basement. Her
        soundscapes felt like they connected to another realm. Kicking off with
        the discovery of 267 tapes in an attic, along with a treasure trove of
        journals hidden in her childhood bedroom, this film tunes in to
        Derbyshire’s frequency; that of a life-long non-conformist, whose peals
        of laughter in an archive interview tickle with delight and
        eccentricity. Featuring a rich archive, interviews, fictional embodiment
        and Cosey Fanni Tutti’s psycho-sonic channelling, director Caroline Catz
        traces acoustic pathways on her archeological dig into Derbyshire’s
        resonant life.</image:caption
