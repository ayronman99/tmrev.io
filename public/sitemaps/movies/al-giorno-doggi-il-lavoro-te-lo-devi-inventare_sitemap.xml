        >GIOVANNI is a man who is completely devoted to his job. Following his
        past as an artist, trying not to sink financially, he decides to take
        over the family tradition and become a carpenter even though he is aware
        that that's not the road he wants to walk. UMBERTO is an unscrupulous
        business man who, for his own financial wellbeing, extorts money from
        desperate people. While Giovanni is creating a work commissioned by two
        unusual brothers, Umberto meets ADELE in a hotel room to obtain his
        'compensation'. Their lives that run parallel will never meet, but they
        will always be united by being the two sides of the same
        medal.</image:caption
