        >Cyborg She follows the burgeoning romance between an ordinary college
        student and his sassy love interest - who happens to be a time-traveling
        cyborg with superhuman powers. One day, a beautiful cyborg girl appears
        in front of a dull university student. Even though the cyborg starts to
        like him, she canâ€™t truly feel emotions, so the boy has no choice but to
        say goodbye. Missing her, he continues his lonely existence. One day, a
        disastrous earthquake hits Tokyo and the cyborg girl saves his life. In
        that moment, she starts to have feelings like a real human
        being.</image:caption
