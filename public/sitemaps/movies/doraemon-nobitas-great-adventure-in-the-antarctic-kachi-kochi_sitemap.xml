        >Unable to endure the midsummer heat, Doraemon transports Nobita and his
        friends to a huge iceberg floating in the South Pacific. While creating
        an amusement parks with the secret tool "Ice-working Iron" the group
        finds a mysterious golden ring in the ice. Upon closer examination, they
        determine that the ring was buried in Antarctica 100,000 years ago -
        before people could have lived there. Doraemon and friends head to
        Antarctica looking for the owner of the ring and come across the ruins
        of a huge city buried in the ice. Using Doraemon's Time Belt, the group
        travels back 100,000 years ago and meets the young girl Kara who is
        connected to the mysterious ring. But now the group must fight for
        survival as Doraemon faces the crisis of the entire Earth
        freezing.</image:caption
