        >Shen Dongxue, Shen Lele, and grandma grew up. I heard grandma said that
        their parents made a lot of money outside, and after a while their
        parents would drive home to pick them up for a better life. The
        children's expectations were extremely high, but the parents did not
        return. So Dong Xue began to take Lele to find the truth-Father Shen
        Xinzhi borrowed countless debts because of the failure of the
        investment, and could only live on construction sites as a construction
        worker. His mother Chen Fengling hooked up a lot of money at the club,
        hoping to get rid of the current dilemma. Chen Fengling betrayed Mr.
        Wang by betraying his body and hue. Mr. Wang gave Chen Fengling a stable
        life. However, after Shen Xinzhi learned everything, he did not find
        Chen Fengling's theory, but took the proof of their secret love directly
        to blackmail Mr. Wang.</image:caption
