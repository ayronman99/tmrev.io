        >Gregory is a devout Catholic who wants to kill evil people in order to
        grant them safe passage to heaven, Gary is an assembly worker at a
        trophy shop who wants to kill potential trophy winners, Graham is Gary's
        intern who will do anything to become a trophy maker and Vinny Van Go
        drives a road emergency van just to make friends. A coincidental
        encounter forces these four dim witted rejects to join forces and embark

        very first serial killer buddy movie of all time</image:caption
