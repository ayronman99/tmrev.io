        >Since its inception in Venezuela in 1976, the El Sistema youth
        orchestra program has transformed the lives of disadvantaged children
        worldwide by putting musical instruments in their hands and encouraging
        them through the mysterious power of music. Following the lives of three
        participants in the Philadelphia and New York programs, Jamie Bersteinâ€™s
        impassioned film introduces Raven, a young violinist with natural
        talent, yet an overshadowing ego; Zebadiah, who needs the confidence to
        defeat his social awkwardness; and Mohammed, a trombonist whose falling
        grades threaten his ability to stay in the program.</image:caption
