        >Francin, manager of a small-town brewery, has a charming wife whose
        abundant blonde locks are an adornment to the town. Maryska looks
        ethereal but loves meat and beer, while Francin is an ascetic. The
        strict members of the brewery board of directors come to audit the
        accounts, but are diverted from concentrating on Francin's detailed
        reports by Maryska, who has organized a pig-killing feast and is ably
        assisting the butcher. When she invites the old curmudgeons on the board
        to enjoy the fresh pork, they are too happy to agree. Francin doesn't
        know whether he is going to get a permanent contract. To make things
        worse his brother Pepin - eccentric, noisy and garrulous - turns up on
        an indefinite visit.</image:caption
