        >Massenet composed his opera about Cenerentola nearly 80 years after
        Rossini did his. And if you are looking for the outburst of the non-stop
        hilarity and the musical jokes of Rossini, you won't find it here. Also,
        while the Cendrillon was highly successful and popular in its time, it
        does not reach up to the artistic and musical levels offered by
        Massenet's other operas, like Manon, or Thais or Werther. Nevertheless,
        this is a delightful opera and it is well presented by The Royal Opera.
        Laurent Pelly created a ingenious setting with movable walls which are
        covered [in French] with the story of Cinderella, and which open and
        close book-like.</image:caption
