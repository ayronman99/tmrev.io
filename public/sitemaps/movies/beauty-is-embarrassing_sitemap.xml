        >Raised in the Tennessee mountains, Wayne White started his career as a
        cartoonist in NYC. He quickly found success as one of the creators of
        the Pee-wee's Playhouse TV show which soon led to more work designing
        some of the most arresting and iconic images in pop culture. Recently
        his word paintings featuring pithy and and often sarcastic text
        statements finely crafted onto vintage landscape paintings have made him
        a darling of the fine art world. The movie chronicles the vaulted highs
        and crushing lows of an artist struggling to find peace and balance
        between his professional work and his personal art. This is especially
        complicated for a man who struggles with the virtues he most often mocks
        in his art...Vanity, ego and fame.</image:caption
