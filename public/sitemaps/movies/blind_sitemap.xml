        >Faye, a former actress that lost her vision due to botched laser eye
        surgery, struggles to put her life back together while living alone in
        her dream house in the Hollywood Hills. Supported by her friend Sophia,
        she starts opening up to Luke, a personal trainer who is mute and can
        only communicate through his cell phone. When a masked stranger named
        Pretty Boy shows up, Faye will realize that she isn't as alone as she
        thinks.</image:caption
