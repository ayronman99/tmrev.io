        >The Ernst Busch Academy is one of Germany's best respected acting
        schools, and every year hundreds of would-be thespians apply in hopes
        that they'll be chosen for their rigorous program of study. Filmmaker
        Andres Veiel chose four students at random as they were accepted at the
        Busch Academy, and in the documentary Die Spielwuetigen, he allows us to
        eavesdrop on them as they spend four years learning their craft and
        growing from callow youngsters to adults in search of their big
        break.</image:caption
