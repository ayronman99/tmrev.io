        >A nostalgic, informative history of drive-in movie theaters, featuring
        extensive archival photographs and interviews with Leonard Maltin, John
        Bloom, Samuel Z. Arkoff, Barry Corbin and many others... Drive-In Movie
        Memories is a film celebration of America's greatest icon of youth,
        freedom and the automobile. What began as an auto parts owner's business
        venture to make some easy money accidentally became a magical place
        where romance, fun and a sense of community flourished. This film
        chronicles the drive-in's birth and development, its phenomenal
        popularity with audiences of all ages, its tragic decline, and its
        inevitable comeback as a classic form of Americana.</image:caption
