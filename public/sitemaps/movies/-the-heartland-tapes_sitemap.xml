        >Across America, the morning of September 11, 2001 began routinely, with
        news and radio broadcasts sharing local human interest stories and
        traffic reports. But by 9 a.m., the day's narrative had taken a tragic
        turn. Most of us are familiar with the national news coverage of 9/11,
        but the local reporting from TV and radio affiliates across the nation
        was no less important and no less compelling. This is an account of the
        tragedy as it unfolded, and as it aired in American cities large and
        small, told without narration or interviews.</image:caption
