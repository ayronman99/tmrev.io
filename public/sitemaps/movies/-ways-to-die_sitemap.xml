        >Sonny "Sundown" Garcia is the top cocaine distributor in the United
        States, which has made him a very rich and powerful man. It has also
        made him plenty of enemies. John Doe is just such a man. A nameless man
        of mystery, John lives to see Sundown not just dead, but to suffer six
        meaningful losses before his deathâ€”his fortune, his freedom, his love,
        his reputation, his most valuable possession and, finally, his life.
        John hires six hit-men, each one assigned to inflict one of the six
        meaningful losses upon Sundown.</image:caption
