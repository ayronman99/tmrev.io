        >As a child, Lian Hua dreamed of becoming a performer in Singapore's
        Getai shows, concerts staged the same month each year and featuring
        emotionally broad songs of love, life and death. However, Lian's father
        dissuaded her from following her dreams, and while Lian never lost her
        love for music, her ambitions would be tied to tragedy as she grew to
        adulthood. As a grown woman, Lian finally seems poised to make her mark
        as a performer when she joins forces with flashy vocalist Astroboy and
        heartthrob Ah Long. Ah Long falls for Lian, but their romance comes to
        an abrupt end and Lian is assaulted by a handful of thugs who want to
        collect a debt from her father. Ten years later, middle aged Lian thinks
        she may have another chance at success when she finds new love, but fate
        has led her to the brink of madness and once again disappointment lies
        in wait for her.</image:caption
