        >Liv is a photojournalist eager to make it on her own. To get a dream
        assignment – shooting the Chang family’s annual holiday party for a
        cover story – she doesn’t reveal that they are in fact, her family. When

        story with her, she wants to confide in him but doesn’t want to
        jeopardize her big break.</image:caption
