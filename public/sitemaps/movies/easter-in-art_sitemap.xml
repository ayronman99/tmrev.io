        >The story of Christ’s death and resurrection has dominated western
        culture for the past 2000 years. It is perhaps the most significant
        historical event of all time, as recounted by the gospels but, equally,
        as depicted by the greatest artists in history. From the triumphant to
        the savage, the ethereal to the tactile, some of western civilization’s
        greatest artworks focus on this pivotal moment. This beautifully crafted
        film explores the Easter story as depicted in art, from the time of the
        early Christians to the present day. Shot on location in Jerusalem,
        United States and throughout Europe, the film explores the different
        ways artists have depicted the Easter story through the ages and thus
        depicts the history of us all.</image:caption
