        >The movie takes place in a village near the Borobudur Temple in the
        Central Java. The village people make their living by digging up stones
        and carving them. Amat (Adadiri Tanpalang), a ten-year-old boy is an
        intelligent and mature boy who helps his mute father with stone carving.
        One day, his teacher requests him to participate in a stone carving
        competition. He never finishes it; instead his father does it for him.
        He wins but he returns the prize to the school because he felt that he
        doesnâ€™t deserve it. He claims that his father is the one who finished
        the statue for competition for him. While his friend, Siti (Acintyaswati
        Widianing) is the one who sent the stone carving to the
        competition.</image:caption
