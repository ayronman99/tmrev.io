        >Carnaby Street Undressed is a story of fashion, music and eye opening
        insights into London's Carnaby Street in its 1960s heyday, told by the
        owners of the fashion shops that defined the iconic Street, and the
        popular musicians who were part of the “the scene”. This includes The
        Who lead sing Roger Daltrey, Donovan, Frank Allen from the Searchers,
        Gary Leeds from The Walker Brothers, and Peter Noone from Herman’s
        Hermits. The film is the story of a generation that rebelled against the
        grey conformity of the 1950s with a cultural revolution emanating from
        Carnaby Street from where it spread across the globe changing fashion
        and music forever.</image:caption
