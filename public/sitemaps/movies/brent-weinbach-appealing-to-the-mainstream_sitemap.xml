        >Brent Weinbach is weird. In this show, Brent attempts to adjust his
        quirky personality so that he can fit in with the world around him,
        which would be valuable to his career as a comedian and entertainer.
        Through an absurd and abstract discourse, Brent explores the ways in
        which he can appeal to a broader, mainstream audience, so that
        ultimately, he can become successful in show business.</image:caption
