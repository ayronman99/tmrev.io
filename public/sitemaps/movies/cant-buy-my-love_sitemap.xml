        >Lilly, a hard working EMT, is only focused on her job and getting into
        medical school. So when wealthy slacker Jeff enters her life it throws
        her off course. At first, Lilly wants nothing to do with Jeff or his
        sense of entitlement and lack of direction. As she spends more time with
        him, she starts to realize that you canâ€™t always judge a book by its
        cover.</image:caption
