        >Dane ‘Marbles’ Marbeck can see ghosts, thanks to a homemade drug: his
        late father’s neurological medication mixed with marijuana. Officer
        Jayson Tagg, a wannabe super-cop on the trail of a serial killer, ends
        up murdered. So when Marbles’ mum plans to sell the family farm, and the
        only way of buying the house off her is taking the money offered by Tagg
        in exchange for his help, Marbles accepts. The unlikely duo of stoner
        medium and ghost cop struggle to reconcile their differences while they
        navigate their way through ghouls, perverts, a mysterious hooded figure,
        and an unexpected shot at love. It becomes clear the only way Marbles
        and Tagg will solve the case with their souls intact is to confront
        their deepest regrets and overcome their prejudices.</image:caption
