        >This Metaphysical Dark Action Comedy "A MAN CALLED NEREUS" is the debut
        feature of writer/director Nathan Hill, for Armored Vision. Nereus is an
        autistic man who is being held captive by the Filaria crime family due
        to his unique ability to predict the exact outcome of sporting events
        through time travel. However, this all changes the moment he is
        kidnapped by a junkie who plans to take him to Las Vegas. Now on the
        run, the two must weave through madmen, corrupt law enforcement and
        new-age terrorists.</image:caption
