        >Sam, a soldier who had served in Afghanistan and Iraq, meets Amira when
        he visits her uncle, Bassam, who had served as Sam's Iraqi translator.
        Bassam and Sam have a special bond due to their time together in the
        war. Initially Amira does not trust him because he was an American
        soldier and her brother was killed by a bomb from American troops in the
        war. Sam's cousin, Charlie, asks Sam to help him with illegal hedge
        funds unbeknownst to Sam at the time. Amira is staying with her uncle
        Bassam since her father died. She sells bootlegged films on the street
        corner but is forced to stay with Sam after getting busted; immigration
        officials begin pursuing her. As the film progresses, Sam and Amira fall
        in love.</image:caption
