        >Bermuda Triangle Exposedâ€™ explores the most deadly and unexplained
        marine graveyard on Earth. It spans from Bermuda to Miami to Puerto
        Rico; from 8,500 metres below the surface of the sea to 8,500 metres
        into the sky. For decades it has held us baffled as it defies
        explanation. Some 2000 boats and 75 planes have disappeared without a
        trace here. Freak waves, magnetic anomalies, giant whirlpools and
        strange fireballs have all been blamed for the unusual disappearances.
        See whether we will ever determine truth behind the mystery of the
        Bermuda Triangle as this programme investigates what is beneath the
        infamous stretch of ocean.</image:caption
