        >One day, one moment, one idea can change lives. Noah Davis is a Pastor
        in an affluent community. Depressed after losing his wife to illness, he
        is contacted by an old friend who has opened a mission in a rough inner
        city neighborhood. With Christmas approaching, he packs up and together
        with his two daughters, moves into Salvation Street Mission. Now the
        family must struggle with the challenges they face in the crime ridden
        community. Noah's inspiration guides his daughters, the mission and the
        neighborhood by bringing them the greatest gift of all,
        hope.</image:caption
