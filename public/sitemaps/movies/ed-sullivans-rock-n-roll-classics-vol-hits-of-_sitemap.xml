        >One of the most popular programs in television history, the Ed Sullivan
        Show brought established musicians and rising stars into homes every
        week. Standout acts such as the Beach Boys, The Carpenters and Supremes
        are included in this collection. Karen Carpenter makes an appearance
        playing the drums during a memorable performance of her hit song "We've
        Only Just Begun." Sixteen other performances round out this trip back to
        the 1960s and 70s.</image:caption
