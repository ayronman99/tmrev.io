        >In the future, nations have been replaced by Projects that are managed
        like corporations. Neighborhoods are Quadrants that closely monitored by
        the supervisors of the Projects and these are led by a man named BLAS.
        Productivity at all costs is at the core of the new society. Against
        this backdrop, ROSA Santos, a university student, falls in love with
        DANIEL, another student from a lesser Quadrant, much to the dismay of
        her mother. Rosa's mother will stop at nothing to better hers and her
        daughter's life including forcing her to marry an influential member of
        the Supervisors, Stefano GRAVELLI, a move that unleashes a series of
        events that will drag Rosa and Daniel into a conflict of political
        intrigue and danger.</image:caption
