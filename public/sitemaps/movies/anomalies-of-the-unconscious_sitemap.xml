        >"This is the second film of the Anomalies Cycle. It is a hand Painted
        and manipulated film. I also used the technique of bleaching and
        batiking of the film emulsion. The footage was then step printed on a
        J-K Optical Printer. Although similar in style to The Flickering of the
        Minds Eye I began to experiment more with other colors and different
        textures such as dried leaves and flowers, hair, insect parts, and a
        variety of different types of inks and paints. The sound track for this
        film was preformed by NEGATIVLAND."</image:caption
