        >At the age of 18, Miles Lagoze enlisted in the Marine Corps. He was
        deployed to Afghanistan where he served as his unit's official
        videographer, shooting and editing footage for the Corps' recruiting
        purposes and historical initiatives. Upon discharging, Lagoze took all
        the footage he and his fellow cameramen shot, and he assembled the very
        documentary the Corps does not want you to see.</image:caption
