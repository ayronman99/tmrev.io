        >An American attack submarine on patrol in the South China Sea
        intercepts an SOS from a Russian freighter. The freighter was attacked
        by unidentified frogmen on the high seas and high grade plutonium was
        stolen. The FBI suspects this attack is the work of Darian Cain, a
        former Russian Commando turned terrorist. When a special anti-terrorist
        team is formed, Special Operations (SPECOP) Commander Webb Buckley and
        navy seal Bone Conn are chosen to join their FBI counterparts special
        agent William Murphy and special agent Morgan Daniels and an uneasy
        alliance is struck between the military and the FBI. Their mission: to
        capture Darian Cain and bring him back to the U.S. to face justice and
        to recover the high grade plutonium.</image:caption
