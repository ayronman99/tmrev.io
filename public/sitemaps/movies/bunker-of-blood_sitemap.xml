        >Negotiations with the Far East have failed, and the unthinkable has
        happened: all-out nuclear war. With civilization as we know it at an
        end, the United States President is whisked away to safety in an
        underground bunker. Along with him is a team of scientists and advisors,
        as well as an elite fighting force of the best assassins and soldiers in
        the country. This Presidential Security team is hand-selected to protect
        and preserve the government in this time of crisis.</image:caption
