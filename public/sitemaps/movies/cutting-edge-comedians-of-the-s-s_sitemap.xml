        >In the late 1950s, a fresh, unconventional style of standup comedy
        emerged in sharp contrast to the standard "Take my wife, please"
        approach. It tackled such previously taboo subjects as sex, religion,
        drugs, and politics, and ushered in an avant-garde era of comedy that
        was decidedly more cerebral, satirical, and improvisational than before.
        Here are many of the maverick comedians who took those big risks years
        ago and paved the way for todayâ€™s current crop of outrageous,
        in-your-face comics. Many of these rare television performances have not
        been seen in 30 or 40 years. Carl Reiner &amp; Mel Brooks (1966) Jackie
