        >A narrative about disease, death, love getting older, and sex. Dave and
        Adam have a meager existence as prostitutes in Toronto, when Dave
        receives a call from a friend in Sudbury. They must rush off in hopes of
        saving her. Adam spends most of his time writing comic books and is
        retelling his story as Strongman and Quickboy, as they fly of to Nebulon
        5 to battle Xenon and save Princess Ariana. He has also brought along
        his video camera to capture the action. These two narratives coexist
        along the road, till they meet King Kipling, who crystallizes their
        concerns through pop philosophy and changes the course of the tale. The
        music of cougar party plays alongside the trip.</image:caption
