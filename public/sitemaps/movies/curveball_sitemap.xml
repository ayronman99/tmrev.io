        >Although he already has searched Iraq unsuccessfully for weapons of
        mass destruction as a member of a UN mission, German bio-weapons expert
        Arndt Wolf is still obsessed with the idea that Saddam Hussein is hiding
        something. Nobody around him is interested in this topic any more. This
        changes abruptly when an Iraqi asylum seeker claims to have been
        involved in the manufacture of chemical weapons. The German Federal
        Intelligence Service summons Dr. Wolf to ascertain the legitimacy of the
        claims made by the informant, who has been given the code name
        “Curveball”.</image:caption
