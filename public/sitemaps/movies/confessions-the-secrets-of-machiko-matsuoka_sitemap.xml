        >Machiko Matsuoka is a high school music teacher who lives with Keiko,
        her older sister with a bad leg. They were close once, but Keiko became
        disabled in an incident. Believing that Machiko was the cause, Keiko has
        treated her like a slave ever since. Machiko has done everything she
        says, but her frustration has accumulated. One day, Machiko begins a
        secret relationship with her student.</image:caption
