        >It’s July 29, 1981. In the majestic St Paul’s Cathedral in London, Lady
        Diana Spencer marries Prince Charles. The same day, another celebration
        takes place in the canteen of a Norwegian small-town factory. It’s the
        newly-weds LIV and TERJE’S wedding party. In the pram lies their
        new-born daughter, DIANA, who, like her famous namesake, will be facing
        a lot of chaos in the years to come thanks to her parents. The wedding,
        and following years, are less glamorous than the royal counterpart, but
        indisputably much more fun. Through the eyes of Diana, we witness the
        rollercoaster of her parent’s marriage. To her, they are the worst
        parents in the world. Miles away from doing a decent job, constantly
        fighting yet still in love by the time Diana is preparing for her own
        marriage 30 years later.</image:caption
