        >In gay parlance, cruise means to explore an area in order to look for a
        possible sexual encounter with someone. This is normally done in parks,
        malls, chatrooms, bars, alleys, etc. Cruising promises no guarantees in
        finding the perfect partner to gratify oneâ€™s carnal urges. But its
        unpredictability and sometimes risky nature makes it more exciting to
        some. Cruising is a personal and physical journey. It explores your
        confidence and capabilities. It fulfills your hidden desires. It is all
        about discoveries. Let us all get into provocative tour and re-affirm
        our sexuality. May the testosterone-filled energy and the captivating
        sexuality of the Men of Provoq escort us in our orgasmic journeys
        through the darkest alleys of our wildest fantasies. Let the journey
        begin.</image:caption
