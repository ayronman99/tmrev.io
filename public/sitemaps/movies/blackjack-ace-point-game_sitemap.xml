        >After wearing a wire to catch a dirty colleague selling confiscated
        drugs, detective Jack Kempson is hated by his colleagues. He also gets
        'promoted away' to the basement, where old files get transferred to the
        national computer database. Thus he comes across fingerprints, now
        identifiable, in the 30 year old case of Ashley, the kidnapped son of
        lottery winners. Although he's too late to help him now, he tracks the
        perpetrators down behind his boss's back.</image:caption
