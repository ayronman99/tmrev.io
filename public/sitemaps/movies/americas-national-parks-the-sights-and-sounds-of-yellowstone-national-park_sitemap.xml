        >This breathtaking video tour of Yellowstone National Park is captured
        by nature photographer Russ Finley in all it's glory, and narrated by
        actor Joseph Campenella. The oldest, largest, and most popular national
        park in this country,k Yellowstone not only offers superb mountain
        scenery, but also is one of the world's principal wildlife preserves.
        See the majestic moose and elk with their huge antlers, rare trumpeter
        swan, ever-hungry bear, playful river otter, skittish coyote and shaggy
        buffalo, all in their native environment. The park fought for it's life
        in the fires of 1988 - seen in dramatic footage - but endures as a
        year-round riot of color and contrast, topped off by the towering geyser
        of Old Faithful</image:caption
