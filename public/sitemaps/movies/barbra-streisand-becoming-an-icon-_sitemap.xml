        >Barbra Streisand grew up in working class Brooklyn, dreaming of escape
        from her tough childhood. A stellar student, she resisted the pressure
        to go to college as her sights were firmly set on Broadway. She was
        determined to become an actress and landed her first role aged 16, but
        it was two years later, when she started to sing, that her career took
        off. Subverting stereotypes and breaking glass ceilings, this programme
        looks at her rise to stardom and the remarkable achievements of her
        early career.</image:caption
