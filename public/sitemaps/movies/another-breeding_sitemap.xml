        >Do-min goes to get money from Bo-yeong and falls in love with her.
        However, Do-min should not be caught. Bo-yeong is just something he has
        to breed. Do-min raises Bo-yeong, but his heart does not stop for her.
        Bo-yeong, noticing other people's feelings, started to read them in
        order to escape from slavery. Bo-yeong, along with Jun-ho, succeeded in
        rearing the people after many twists and turns, and tried to escape from
        slavery using the people, but was blocked by Seong-hee. Seong-hee tries
        to sell Bo-yeong and Jun-ho to Do-chool, and Bo-young tries her best to
        overcome the crisis. Bo-yeong and Jun-ho finally succeeded in defeating
        Seong-hee. Bo-yeong enjoys her success by taking revenge on Seong-hee
        and the people, but is attacked by Jun-ho. Bo-yeong is again strategized
        as a slave by Jun-ho.</image:caption
