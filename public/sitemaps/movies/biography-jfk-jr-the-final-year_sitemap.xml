        >July 16, 2019 marks the 20-year anniversary of John F. Kennedy Jr.’s
        death. This two-hour documentary special, airing on the anniversary,
        reframes the last year of his life in an entirely new way. Inspired by
        Steven M. Gillon’s upcoming book, America’s Reluctant Prince: The Life
        of John F. Kennedy Jr., this captivating special is the most substantive
        documentary to date and includes convincing new evidence regarding his
        political aspirations before his untimely death. This compelling
        documentary shines an unexpectedly poignant light on 1999, his last
        year, as he coped with the fatal illness of his closest friend and
        cousin, Anthony Radziwill, struggled to save his marriage and tried to
        rescue his political magazine, George.</image:caption
