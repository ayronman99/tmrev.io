        >"Brice Marden: 4 Decades" follows the renowned abstract artist as he
        explores his acclaimed 2006 MoMA retrospective with curator Gary
        Garrels. Applauded for his bold and contemporary style, Marden speaks
        openly with Garrels about his approach, beginnings and influences. His
        fluid and colorful works demand attention but welcome the viewer to
        choose their own path within the painting itself. Marden's career is
        mapped out through a tour of the exhibition, as he and Garrels discuss
        key works of the last forty years.</image:caption
