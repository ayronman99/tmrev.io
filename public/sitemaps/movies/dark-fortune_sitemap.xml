        >Late at night, the psychologist Eliane Hess is called to the hospital
        to take care of Yves, an eight-year-old boy, who just has lost his
        parents and siblings in a car accident. Eliane is both shocked and
        curiously drawn to the traumatized boy. As time goes by, she loses the
        professional distance to the patient, and when Yves' relatives begin a
        heavy dispute about the boy's future, Eliane makes an unorthodox
        decision, that throws her life off track.</image:caption
