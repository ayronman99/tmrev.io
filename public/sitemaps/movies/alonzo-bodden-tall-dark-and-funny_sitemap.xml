        >Everything is fair game for controversial comic Alonzo Bodden, and now
        the funnyman who brought down the house on Last Comic Standing 3 strikes
        out on his own in his first-ever solo stand-up performance. There are no
        judges to play to, and no censors to appease, and as Bodden cuts loose
        to tackle topics ranging from race to relationships and virtually
        everything in between, viewers can laugh right along with the live
        audience as they bear witness to a fearless new force in the world of
        comedy.</image:caption
