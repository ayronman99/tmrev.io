        >Caleb is an ex-marine who's drifting through life trying to find
        answers. He moves back to his childhood home to escape his nightmares.
        He finds that everything's different. His high school sweetheart is now
        engaged. His parish priest, to whom he always turned for support, is
        struggling with his own crisis of faith. And instead of getting better,
        the nightmares start coming true.</image:caption
