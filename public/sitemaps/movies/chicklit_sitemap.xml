        >ChickLit is a comedy drama about four guys trying to save their local
        pub from closing down. They group write a chick lit, or more
        specifically a 'mummy porn' novel in the style of 'Fifty Shades of Grey'
        and it gets snapped up. The only snag is that the publisher insists that
        the young woman 'author' does press and publicity. The guys have to keep
        their involvement a secret and so engage an out of work actress to 'role
        play' the part of the author. This leads to her becoming the star in the
        film of the book, the tables are turned on the guys and she is in
        control - leaving them with the awful prospect of having to secretly
        churn out sex novels for the foreseeable future.</image:caption
