        >Fifteen years ago Winona became a vampire. She was imprisoned in her
        grave by Father Rivers, and Winona's young daughter, Janeth, was sent to
        live with relatives in another state. Now Janeth is grown, and back in
        town to try to come to terms with the memory of losing her mother.
        Unknowingly she releases her mother from her grave, and now Winona is
        out for revenge on Father Rivers, his family, and all those responsible
        for her being imprisoned in the grave for all those years. Her lust for
        blood and vengeance must be satisfied!</image:caption
