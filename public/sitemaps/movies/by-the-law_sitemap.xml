        >A five-person team of gold prospectors in the Yukon has just begun to
        enjoy great success when one of the members snaps, and suddenly kills
        two of the others. The two survivors, a husband and wife, subdue the
        killer but are then faced with an agonizing dilemma. With no chance of
        turning him over to the authorities for many weeks, they must decide
        whether to exact justice themselves or to risk trying to keep him
        restrained until they can return to civilization.</image:caption
