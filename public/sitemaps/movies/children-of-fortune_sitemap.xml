        >Navy detective Dave Passenger is assigned to investigate the murder of
        a sailor's girlfriend. Dave follows the trail of evidence to a small
        Arizona community where polygamy is still being practiced. Along for the
        ride is Passenger's estranged 15-year-old daughter Erica who has been
        invited to participate in the investigation by Dave in the hope that he
        can mend a few family fences while tracking down the
        culprit.</image:caption
