        >Many people think of Space as a quiet and desolate vacuum of emptiness,
        but new evidence reveals that space is rife with activity beyond our
        comprehension. Just as we sent Voyager and Pioneer probes beyond our
        solar system, Aliens have probes of their own that may have arrived as
        early as the 1600's. While Tesla was the first to successfully
        communicate with neighboring worlds using radio waves, we have received
        recent signals from intelligent sources. In 1989, Russian Space Probe
        Phobos 2 photographed a UFO on the surface of Mars just prior to losing
        contact. Scientists have determined that the craft was real and of a
        thin elliptical shape over 20 miles in length. We are not alone in outer
        space and while the Aliens may be initiating contact, they could also be
        here already.</image:caption
