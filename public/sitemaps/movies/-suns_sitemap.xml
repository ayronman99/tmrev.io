        >A man called "The Black" is hired to smuggle a group of undocumented
        migrants into the United States. He wants to quit the smuggling business
        and claims this is his last trip. His superiors, now suspicious, send
        Gavilan, a younger smuggler, to keep an eye on him. During the troubled
        crossing, the smugglers fight and eventually lose part of their human
        cargo. "The Black" escapes from his former associates but also needs to
        ecape from the Border Patrol.</image:caption
