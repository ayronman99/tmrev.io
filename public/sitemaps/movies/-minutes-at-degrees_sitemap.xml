        >Two years after losing his wife, John (Richard Riehle) finds solace in
        an unusual connection. John spends his free time engaging in an online
        relationship with a woman (Elizabeth Gillies) who makes him feel
        connected to his late wife by helping John recreate her recipes. When a
        masked robber (John Gemberling) appears during their session one night,
        a whirlwind of events unfolds. The disgruntled robber is caught-off
        guard by the webcam girl and, in a unique turn of events, they become
        forced to work in tandem to save John's life as the night
        escalates.</image:caption
