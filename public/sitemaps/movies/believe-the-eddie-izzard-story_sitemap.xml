        >The story of one person's triumph over adversity: cameras followed the
        comedian on a very stressful comeback tour and caught the story behind
        some of her best loved material en route. Prior to her Sexie tour in
        2003 and under extreme pressure to write, she delved into her own life
        for inspiration. So began an accidental voyage into her past that
        paralleled her world tour and culminated in a moment of revelation about
        the source of her relentless drive. Film contains exclusive
        never-before-seen footage including the famous 'wolves' material,
        Izzard's first student sketches and unicycle-riding as a street
        performer in Covent Garden. Hilarious and moving by turns, an inspiring
        tale of how tragedy can be turned to laughter.</image:caption
