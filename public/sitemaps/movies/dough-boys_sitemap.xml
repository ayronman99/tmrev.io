        >Frank and Lou are brothers, running the family's bakery, a fixture in
        their Bronx neighborhood since 1921. Lou loves it, but the rest of his
        life is in tatters: he lives alone, bets on the horses, and owes a loan
        shark. Frank, older, married, and always responsible, wants to get out
        of the bakery and pursue other dreams. Things come to a head on the day
        Lou's marker comes due and Frank announces big news. They find
        themselves reflecting on the life choices they've made.</image:caption
