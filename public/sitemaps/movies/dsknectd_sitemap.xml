        >As clich√©s go, in 1999 the World as we knew it was about to change -
        and we'd been expecting it. Since childhood we'd been promised that the
        21st century would bring us dramatic new technologies like flying cars
        and Utopian cities. Instead it bought us the smart-phone, social media,
        and virtual societies. And as it turns out these technologies began to
        transform society almost as dramatically as the moon colonies we'd been
        expecting. Now over a decade into the revolution, 'DSKNECTD' explores
        how digital communication technology is profoundly changing the way we
        interact and experience each other - for the good and for the
        bad.</image:caption
