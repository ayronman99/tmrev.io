        >Vasyl Serediuk - head of the local Museum - having sent his daughter
        Kateryna to a french university, never expected the outcome: a month ago
        she informed him that she is getting married to a French heart surgeon
        François. Since then Vasyl’s proud statement spread throughout the whole
        region: “The Serediuks have made their European choice!". How huge was
        his surprise when he saw that the cherished European future son-in-law
        is a Frenchman of African origin. Organizing a wedding so that it never
        happens seems like a brilliant idea. But when true love stands in the
        way, the success of such plan is not a given.</image:caption
