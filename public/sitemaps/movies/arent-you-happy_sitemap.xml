        >A girl roams through the city looking for a place to sleep. Along the
        way she meets young mothers who celebrate motherhood religiously, goes
        home with an abstinent existentialist for whom sex is “just another
        market”, and waits for the end of capitalism in a drag bar. Her attempt
        to write a book doesn’t make it beyond the first sentence of the second
        chapter, and she finds no space between art galleries, yoga studios and
        the beds of strangers. Instead of trying to fit in, she starts regarding
        her depression as a political issue.</image:caption
