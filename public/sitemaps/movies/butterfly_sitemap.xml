        >A butterfly, a creature symbolising rebirth and a new beginning,
        epitomises Romina’s and Germán’s world, a world that consists of two
        parallel realities. In one of them they grow up as siblings who desire
        each other and try to give shape to their love without sexual
        fulfilment; in the other they are a young man and woman who form an
        awkward friendship instead of succumbing to their feelings for each
        other. Germán finds himself in a discordant relationship with Mariela.
        Mariela’s brother is interested in Bruno. Bruno is with Romina, but
        wants to be with Germán. Playfully alternating between these two
        realities, the lovers find themselves drawn into ever new couplings in
        order to explore their intuitive feelings – cautiously, but at the same
        time prepared to lose everything.</image:caption
