        >The film is based on the stories of 12 women who lived the Women's
        Liberation movement in Japan in the 1970s. The Women's Liberation
        influenced countless individual lives, and those who met the Women's
        Liberation realized the importance of living their own lives honestly
        with their own senses and thoughts, not influenced by some traditional
        values and norms.</image:caption
