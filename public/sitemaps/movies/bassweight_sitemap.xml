        >BASSWEIGHT is a feature length documentary that offers an unparalleled
        insight into the subterranean world of Dubstep. Charting the genre's
        growth from obscure origins in south London to global recognition today,
        the film features in-depth interviews with many of the DJ's, producers
        and promoters who have been instrumental in Dubstep's ongoing evolution.
        Skream, Benga, Kode9 and Mary Anne Hobbs are just some of the key
        players who have contributed, reflecting on the movement they've helped
        shape; a movement that has come to define the importance of underground
        music in the 21st Century. This highly stylised film travels from
        Dubstep's birthplace in Croydon to Europe, Brazil and Japan,
        demonstrating just how huge an impact this initially indigenous scene
        has made at an international level.</image:caption
