        >Avi is a photographer having a relationship with Sonia who is a model.
        One night the couple after driving from a late night party accidentally
        bumps of a young girl. As Sonia is driving the car, to avoid further
        complications, Avi insists on them fleeing away from the accident scene.
        But trouble starts for the couple soon after. While Avis clicked photos
        start having strange white marks over them, Sonia starts having spooky
        experiences. Avi also develops a severe shoulder pain and even though he
        is not overweight he starts weighing 120 kilos. Avi too then starts
        having similar experiences like Sonia. The couple is petrified when all
        three of Avis best buddies kill themselves in a similar manner. It then
        comes to light that the spirit haunting them all has a connection to
        Avis college life. Meanwhile Sonia finds out that Avi was friends with
        one Aarti during his college days. What is Aartis connection to all this
        and what revelation awaits Sonia forms the rest of the
        film.</image:caption
