        >For some aging music fans and kids with a passion for musical history,
        The Replacements are rock and roll defined. Gorman Bechard's remarkable
        history of the 'Mats takes us from their first show as the Impediments
        to their 1991 onstage breakup in Chicago, and everywhere in between.
        Bechard bravely eschews including the band's music, photos, and live
        footage, instead relying solely on the fans: their well-kept memories,
        hilarious anecdotes, and differing points of views about the foursome's
        wildly varied discography and infamous antics.</image:caption
