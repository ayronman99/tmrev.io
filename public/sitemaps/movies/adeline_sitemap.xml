        >When a mysterious doctor arrives in a small Midwestern town, her
        therapy horse, Adeline, quickly gains a reputation for ‘healing’ those
        with special needs. Not used to this alternative form of healing, some
        begin to question the authenticity of Adeline’s methods and tensions
        arise. But one day during an equine therapy session, a destructive
        tornado descends upon the barn. Adeline leaps into action and corrals
        her students, pushing them against the founding wall of the stable.
        Although Adeline saves the lives of 12 people, she takes the brunt of
        the storm’s destructive force and suffers a shattered leg. With the
        town’s people now convinced of Adeline’s amazing spirit, they band
        together to raise the funds necessary to fix her leg and save her life.
        Based on an inspirational true story, Adeline teaches all those she
        encounters the same powerful lesson: miracles happen when you let go of
        the reins.</image:caption
