        >A Peace of the Anarchy is a quick summary of 20th century radical
        activism in the USA with a notable focus on the pacifist christian
        anarchist Ammon Hennacy. Folks from the War Resisters League, the IWW,
        Earth First! and the Catholic Worker, along with Mr. Hennacy exemplify
        the marginalized prophetic witness for peace and justice in the USA as
        they attempt to appeal to the dominant culture. These people speak on
        the benefits of anarchy and peace, following the radical
        (rooted/basically grounded) ideology and optimism that goodness will
        overcome evil, love is superior to hate and truth trumps
        falsehood.</image:caption
