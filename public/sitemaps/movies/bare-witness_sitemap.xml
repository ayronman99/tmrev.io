        >Professional killer Gav Reed commits a grave mistake allowing himself
        to be videotaped (as she always does, for a documentary she hopes to
        sell to Hollywood about the real nocturnal 'eldest business' there) by
        Julie Spencer, one of Max 'Slim' Reuter's hookers and porn actresses,
        whom he had sex with before - and while making a most incriminating call
        about his murder attempt at a high society campaign party for mayor
        Garland's electoral challenger Mary Washington, where the bullet is
        however caught by councilor Frank Constantine, who also survives. Gav's
        client, businessman Ian Hunter, who was videotaped earlier, has his girl
        Marina shoot Gav and then Julie, later Slim who. Rough but effective
        police detective Killian investigates, helped by Julie's friend Carly
        Marsh, and unravels even more sordid connections.</image:caption
