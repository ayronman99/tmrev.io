        >Asti is obsessed to unite all his elder brother's friends of rock band
        named The Bandits. She started to get close to them one by one by
        reminding the memory of his brother Bonnie, Asti got Damon, the
        guitarist who now works in a dangdut bar to join in. Then they ask
        Gendro-the former drummer of the Bandits- now married and having
        financial difficulties. Then, they ask Bule, who had became a
        transsexual. In the mean time, Soljah, the keyboardist who's put on too
        much weight, is missing. They could not find him anywhere. The conflict
        comes between the story to get a vocalist and the love story of Asti and
        Damon.</image:caption
