        >Hannah and her son Leon flee from a war that has isolated their
        country. Trying to cross the border, they enter No Manâ€™s Land, a refugee
        camp that provides them with a bed and food, but will subject them to a
        severely oppressive system forcing them to compete to be able to stay at
        the camp. Claus, an old acquaintance, claims to know a secret about
        Hannah and Leon that, if brought to light, would endanger their
        lives.</image:caption
