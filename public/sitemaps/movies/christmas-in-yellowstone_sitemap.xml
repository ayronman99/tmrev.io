        >NATURE presents Christmas in Yellowstone, a breathtaking look at
        wintertime deep within America’s first national park. NATURE follows in
        the snowy footprints of Yellowstone’s red foxes, spies on the predatory
        warfare of wolves and elk, and climbs into the den of a grizzly bear
        that gives birth to two cubs while deep in hibernation. In addition to
        mesmerizing footage of landscapes and wildlife, trail alongside author
        and photographer Tom Murphy, who has been coming to Yellowstone for the
        past 26 winters, camping and photographing amid the silence and solitude
        of the park. And go behind the scenes with filmmaker Shane Moore to find
        out how he kept up with Murphy during an at times harrowing trek,
        reminiscent of the legendary John Colter’s first journey into the park
        nearly two hundred years ago.</image:caption
