        >Hope and closure are not always words that come to mind when discussing
        a film about the Khmer Rouge, whose bloody, fanatical rule from 1975 to
        1979 resulted in the deaths of more than two million people from
        starvation, disease, torture and executions. But these two do come
        together, despite the pain of memories, in Cambodia After Farewell, a
        well-acclaimed, 100-minute documentary by French Cambodian director Iv
        Charbonneau-Ching and Jeremy Knittel to mark 4 decades since the Khmer
        Rouge took control of the Southeast Asian country to put in place the
        purest form of communism and the ideal agrarian society. The documentary
        follows the journey back to Cambodia – and into the past – of the family
        of Iv Charbonneau-Ching, with his mother and aunt, as they reconstruct,
        piece by piece, what happened to the family members they lost to the
        Khmer Rouge.</image:caption
