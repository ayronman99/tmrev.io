        >Life was easy for Jackson White. With looks, brains, and athletic
        ability,the world's possibilities seemed limitless. But, when he came to
        Los Angeles to pursue a career in the music industry, he was so seduced
        by money and status that he lost track of who he was. Now, with both his
        personal and professional lives on the edge of ruin, he's been called
        home to care for his dying father. While in North Carolina, he'll have
        to confront the friends he lost track of and the girl he never
        met.</image:caption
