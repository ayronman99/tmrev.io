        >Jass (Yuvraj Hans) and Velly (Harish Verma) are both college-going
        boys, who fall in love with Avantika Hundal and Rose (Parul Gulati)
        respectively. Their odysseys of love make them do many crazy things and
        finally are compelled to get into the college Bhangra Team. Though they
        are reluctant to join it in the starting, but eventually become
        passionate about it. Dutta (B.N. Sharma) does not want them to perform.
        Their college is sailing in uncertainties of being shut down; a flop
        show by the Bhangra Team will result in college being locked down. In
        his attempts to flop the show, he how so ever manages to convince
        parents of Velly, Jass and his friend, who make sure that their sons do
        not perform that day by engaging them into some important works. - See
