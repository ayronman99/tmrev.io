        >Power Play is a hilarious comedy concert where actor and comedian DeRay
        Davis proves that even after starring in several feature films, he still
        reigns as The Streets comic. Davis takes his audience through a
        side-splitting, roller coaster riot of subjects ranging from The Hood to
        Hollywood, as well as hood-rats and heaven. From relationships gone bad
        to rappers gone rogue, nothing is too taboo and no one is safe from the
        knock-out power punches that only DeRay The Difference can deliver.
        Filmed in front of a sold-out audience at the Best Buy Theater in New
        York s Times Square, Power Play is DeRay's best uncensored performance
        to-date and will surely be regarded as a classic among the comedy
        greats.</image:caption
