        >Barah Aana is a comedy of real life set in today's Mumbai. The story
        revolves around three unlikely friends: a driver (Naseeruddin Shah), a
        watchman (Vijay Raaz) and a waiter (Arjun Mathur). The driver is an
        older man, stoic but dependable. The watchman, in his 30's, is a
        pushover at work but otherwise mischievous. The waiter is a young,
        swaggering chap, brimming with ambition. Living together, their
        different attitudes make for an interesting banter.At some point,
        misfortune befalls the watchman, and due to a series of chance events,
        he stumbles into a crime. Striking upon a seemingly low-risk way to make
        good money, and discovering a new sense of self-confidence, he tries to
        entice the others to join him in a series of such crimes. Cat and mouse
        games ensue between the three as personalities change, but events soon
        spiral out of control, leading them in a direction that none of them had
        ever wanted to take...</image:caption
