        >In 2084, a nuclear war wasted Earth, making the sky red of chemicals
        and the former United States of America becomes Deathlands. Breeds of
        mutants and half-mutants share what was left on Earth with humans. The
        vile of "Front Royale" is ruled by a good man, but he is killed by his
        wife Lady Rachel Cawdor, and his evil son Harvey Cawdor kills one of his
        brothers and blinds one eyes of his fifteen years old brother Ryan, who
        escapes. Twenty years later, the one-eyed leader Ryan Cawdor returns to
        "Front Royale" with his girlfriend and half-mutant Krysty Worth, his
        human friend and specialist in weapons JB Dix and the teenage mutant Jak
        Laurent to face his brother and his stepmother.</image:caption
