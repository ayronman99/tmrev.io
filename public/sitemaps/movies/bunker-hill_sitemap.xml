        >Peter Salem, a former Wall Street executive recently released from
        prison, returns to his ex-wife and children in the small town of Bunker
        Hill, Kansas. Soon after he arrives, the town's electricity and power
        are shut off, and there is no way to communicate with authorities
        outside of town. The town's militant past is reawakened and forces
        coalesce to protect citizens from an unseen enemy. The town's fear leads
        to the creation of a posse of gunmen, resulting in torture, illegal
        searches and eventually, murder, against which Salem must
        stand.</image:caption
