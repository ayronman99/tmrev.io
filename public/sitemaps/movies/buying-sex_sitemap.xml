        >Timely and wise, this feature documentary explores the state of
        prostitution laws in Canada. Buying Sex captures the complexity of the
        issue by listening to the frequently conflicting voices of sex workers,
        policy-makers, lawyers and even the male buyers who make their claim for
        why prostitution is good for society. Examining the realities in Sweden
        and New Zealand, and respecting the differences of ideology as Canada
        works its way toward an uneasy consensus, the film challenges us to
        think for ourselves and offers a gripping and invaluable account of just
        what is at stake for all of us.</image:caption
