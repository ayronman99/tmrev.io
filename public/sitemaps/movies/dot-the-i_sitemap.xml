        >Young lovers in London are wrapped up in a love triangle that may not
        be exactly what it seems. Carmen, a beautiful Spanish woman with a
        tendency to lose her temper at the drop of a hat, is about to be married
        to Barnaby, a caring, wealthy, but slightly boring Englishman. While out
        with friends on her 'hen night' she encounters a stranger who suddenly
        sparks a passion that has been sleeping within her. As her wedding date
        approaches, she finds herself struggling to put this newcomer out of her
        mind, but his effect on her keeps growing stronger. What is it that he
        sees in her, and why does she feel like she's being pushed inevitably
        into his arms?</image:caption
