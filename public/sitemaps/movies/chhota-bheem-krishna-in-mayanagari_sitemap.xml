        >Bheem and his Friends are having a great time in Dwarka with their
        friend Kanha.Mayandri tries to attack Kanha with some leopards but fails
        as Kanha fights them off with ease.Bheem gets injured and his friend
        Krishna offers to heal up his injury and just before the Dholakpurians
        leave Krishna offers some gifts to them.Bheem gets a pendant,Chutki gets
        a stylish ring,Raju gets a catapult and Jaggu got a compass whereas
        Kalia got a powder for when he blows on anyone can hear what they are
        thinking and Dholu and Bholu got a box in which they could ask for
        anything they want in food.Bheem suddenly feels it was time for everyone
        to go back to Dholakpur and they board their ship and bid farewell to
        Krishna their beloved friend.</image:caption
