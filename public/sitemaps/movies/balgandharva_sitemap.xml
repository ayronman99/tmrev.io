        >Balgandharva, the eminent towering singer from the bygone golden era of
        Marathi "sangeet natak" (musical dramas) definitely deserved some modern
        celluloid space. This film does well to document his life, the younger
        generation who is unaware of his charisma will get to know him. The film
        chronicles his life , his acting career well. It gives a good overview
        of how the drama companies were run and how he influenced the running.
        His values and character stand out amidst all the tragedies in his
        life.</image:caption
