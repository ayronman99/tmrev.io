        >When long-time British agent Harry Palmer loses his job because the
        Cold War is over, he's promptly approached by a Russian bossman, Alex.
        In St. Petersburg Alex tells Harry of his plan for Russia's future,
        which is threatened because a deadly biochemical weapon called the Red
        Death has been stolen from him. He'll pay Harry handsomely to retrieve
        it. An ex-spy friend tips Harry off that it's being sent to Beijing by
        train, aboard which we begin to learn whose side everyone's really
        on.</image:caption
