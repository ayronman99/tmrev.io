        >Nami’s father was a legendary truck driver, and after his death, Nami
        inherited the deco-truck With her up-beat personality and super driving
        technique, Nami is popular among her customers. By coincidence, Nami
        meets Momoka, a hooker who takes truck drivers as customers. Momoka says
        to Nami, “I want to start a new life !!” and begs that she wants to be
        Nami’s assistant. She is overwhelmed by Momoka’s passion, and decides to
        take her in. One day, after dinner, the two return to the truck and sees
        that there is a box which they must have forgotten to load. So they load
        the box back in the truck, and the odd twosome drive away to the next
        destination. This “box” is the start of trouble for Nami and Momoka.
        What lies ahead in their destiny?!</image:caption
