        >When Lara lost her husband of five months, she didn't think she could
        go on living, much less love again. Now, seven months later, Lara is
        still in mourning. Every time a loved one died, someone else was there
        to cushion the blow. When her mother followed six years later, there was
        the rest of the family. But when her husband died, no one could offer
        any consolation - not her siblings, not her in-laws, not her friends.
        Not only was he the love of her life, he had also become her life. It
        would have been better if she died with him. In the meantime, her
        business -has taken a nosedive. She's also deep in debt with her unpaid
        condo and car mortgages. With all her predicament, how would Oliver and
        Chris figure in her life? Will she finally move on?</image:caption
