        >In the early 1900's, a new invention was created to address the
        'problem' of women's hysteria. These devices immediately became an
        essential household appliance, and were advertised in nearly every
        women's magazine and sewing notions catalog of the time. 70 Years later,
        these appliances were condemned as 'perverted sex toys,' and became the
        subject of heated debate among lawmakers. In California, Texas, and
        several other states, conservative politicians successfully waged
        legislative campaigns to outlaw and prohibit the sale, ownership or use
        of vibrators and dildos while simultaneously criminalizing other
        'deviant' sexual practices. Although a number of these laws have been
        overturned by legislatures or the courts, in the State of Texas freedom
        fighters are still working to eliminate these absurd and unnecessary
        laws. Dildo Diaries takes a lighthearted but 'probing' approach to
        exploring the development of sections of the Texas Penal Code and its
        effects on the adult sex toy industry.</image:caption
