        >On January 8, 2020, Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 went down
        as it was leaving Iranian air space. All 176 people on board were
        killed, many of them Iranian Canadians. For weeks Iranian authorities
        vociferously denied responsibility, but foreign governments and agencies
        were certain the plane was shot down by Iranian military, a fact Iranâ€™s
        government eventually admitted. There were no answers as to why the
        plane was fired on or even why it was allowed to take off, since
        hostilities had broken out in the region in preceding
        days.</image:caption
