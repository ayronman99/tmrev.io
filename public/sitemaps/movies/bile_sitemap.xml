        >"How thin is the human skin? What does it hide behind? The leather bag
        of apocalypse." Bile is an introspective essay on the notion of the
        human body as a political metaphor. Layer-by-layer the film digs down in
        order to reach answers to the proposed questions: what is body, what is
        illness and finally what is death. A journey through the history of
        medical imaging and a reflection on the recent death of the director's
        mother in the decorations of post-Soviet Russia. Getting under the skin
        of the viewer, the film attempts to comprehend the complex subject of
        corporeality. The title Bile refers to the physical and mental
        conditions of the human being. In fact, black bile comes from the old
        Greek for melancholy: melas chol√®.</image:caption
