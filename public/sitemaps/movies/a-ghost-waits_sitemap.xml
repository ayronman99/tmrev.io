        >Jack's job is to fix up the house. Spectral agent Muriel's eternal task
        is to haunt it. They should be enemies, but they become fascinated by
        one another and eventually smitten, leading them to question everything
        about their work, lives, and decisions. But as pressure mounts for them
        to fulfil their duties, somethingâ€™s got to give for them to have the
        time together they both so desperately want.</image:caption
