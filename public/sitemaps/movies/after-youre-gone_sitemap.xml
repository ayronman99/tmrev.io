        >Aleksey Temnikov is a renowned ballet dancer and an acknowledged genius
        whose career was abruptly cut short after sustaining an injury in the
        1990s. Twenty years later, Aleksey discovers that his condition is
        degenerative and that he will soon lose the ability to walk. Aleksey
        sets out to choreograph a ballet he envisaged long before but never
        staged for fear of failure. “What will I leave behind after I am gone?”
        is a question Aleksey feels he must contend with. However, returning to
        the world of ballet will not be easy for a man who has made so many
        enemies over the course of his life.</image:caption
