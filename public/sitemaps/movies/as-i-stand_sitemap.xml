        >This heartwarming story follows two families that are brought together
        by tragedy but forever joined through faith. Devin Wheeler and Matthew
        Daniels are loving, hard working men who believe in God, family, and
        helping others. Their lives quickly turn into a search for peace and
        understanding when a single horrific event impacts everything that they
        have ever loved. While Devin looks to his faith for strength, guidance,
        and refuge; Matthew shuns his faith placing blame and demanding answers.
        As the landscape of their lives continues to change, each man handles
        the road ahead in a very different fashion. An unlikely friendship would
        soon form, causing both men to meet at a crossroads faced with the same
        question...Would you love God for nothing?</image:caption
