        earning 4 crores to rescue the slum dwellers in his area from a builder.
        He and his gang go to Vizag and rob a bank. And they hide the loot in a
        building under construction. They were forced to go away for a month and
        when they return they find a police control room at the spot where they
        hidden their loot. In order to retrieve the loot, Blade Babji takes the
        position of newly joined Krishna Manohar (spoof of Pokiri) by kidnapping
        him. The rest of the story is all about the comedy of errors that
