        >It is May 2001 in a pre-9/11 world. Arthur Lieberman, a ne'er-do-well
        tennis instructor from West Palm Beach, is the son of losing
        Vice-President candidate Joe Lieberman. Arthur is so crazy that six
        months later he is still upset over the fraudulent 2000 presidential
        election. in an attempt to keep from "making waves" his father strikes a
        corrupt deal to land him in a fancy co-op apartment in New York City.
        Arthur's desperation for relevance and burning desire to appear on the
        Charlie Rose Show lead him to start an "Intellectual Salon". There,
        Arthur pleads with misfits, sluts, and drunks to vote him president of
        their group. Soon, Arthur is unwittingly inculcated by two radical
        Jewish zealot Postal workers to commit a terrorist attack. Hilarity
        ensues!</image:caption
