        >A powerful triad boss has been kidnapped, and the new police
        superintendent Koo decides to recruit the help of Mann, a former
        supercop who has since been relegated to back-up duty. Mann has his work
        cut out for him when he realizes his opponent is Sam, a former cop with
        plenty of grudges. When Sam takes the fight to Mannâ€™s family, Mann is
        more than determined to bring down the dangerous kidnapper and his
        gang.</image:caption
