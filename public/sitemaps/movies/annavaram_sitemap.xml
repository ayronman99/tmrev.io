        >Annavaram (Pawan Kalyan) has a lot of attachment with his sister Varam
        (Sandhya). He wants to see his sister trouble free even after marriage
        and hence wanted to get her married to a city guy who has all the
        facilities like mixie, grinder, gas stove, running water and such
        facilities. True to his taste, Annavaram marries Varam to a guy (Shiva
        Balaji) who stays in Hyderabad. In order to leave her at her husband's
        place, Annavaram drops Varam in Hyderabad. Aishwarya (Asin Thottumkal)
        is the neighbour of Varam's husband who is chirpy and moves very close
        with everyone without any inhibition. During his stay, Annavaram finds
        that the city is full of goons and his brother-in-law pacifies him not
        to take everything to head and one should have the adjustment mentality
        to stay in the city.</image:caption
