        >Young man, Yusuke Mamiana, fed up with his life meats a unattractive
        ugly girl, Kyoko, at his hometown. Out of his impulsive desire, he had a
        relationship by nearly raping her. They started to live together and
        gradually feel 'Family' attachment in each other. As time passes, Yusuke
        starts to think more about 'Happiness' of his family and
        himself.</image:caption
