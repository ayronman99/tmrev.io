        >In her final year at school, Anthropology student Lorraine decides to
        film her final project - the subject of exorcism within the Catholic
        Church. Recording interviews with priests from the local diocese, she
        stumbles upon Fr. Byrne, an older priest who is currently helping a
        young mother whose daughter is apparently possessed by a demonic force.
        The curiosity of Lorraine, along with her camera operator, Cathal, leads
        them down a dark path of discovering the terrifying truth, and things go
        from strange to worse as all involved become entangled into a frightful
        journey to save a little girl's life.</image:caption
