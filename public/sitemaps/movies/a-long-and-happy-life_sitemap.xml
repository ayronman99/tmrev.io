        >Sascha lives in a village on the Kola Peninsular in northern Russia and
        dedicatedly manages what is left of an old collective farm. He gets on
        well with his farm workers who respect him and also tolerate his more or
        less clandestine love-affair with Anya, a secretary at the local
        government office. But then Sascha is suddenly faced with a dilemma: the
        district’s self-seeking administrators, none of whom could be termed
        squeamish, offer him a lucrative deal for the farm. In legal terms,
        Sascha doesn’t have much of a leg to stand on since his lease on the
        farm was only agreed with a handshake. The pressure mounts, and even
        more so when his employees convince him to stand firm. Against the
        backdrop of a landscape exposed to the elements, this unflinching man’s
        destiny takes its course.</image:caption
