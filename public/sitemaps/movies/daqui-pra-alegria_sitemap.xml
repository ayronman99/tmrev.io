        >Three girls from the Lisbon suburbs, Bruna, Marta and Sara, are having
        a bit of fun. They've discovered that people in general are prepared to
        give things to young, attractive and good-natured people, and they
        exploit this shamelessly. Francisco, a neighbour of theirs, has given up
        on life. He's abandoned his wife and child to take refuge far from those
        who might hurt him ; in effect dying. He's ashamed of this, and never
        ever looks at anyone. This has given him, amongst the women of the
        neighbourhood, the reputation of being able to tell, just by looking at
        a couple, how long they'll stay together. The sudden news of the death
        of his much loved wife, upsets Francisco's routine.</image:caption
