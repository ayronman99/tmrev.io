        >Frank and Bethany are happily married in a loving but unfulfilled
        relationship. To satisfy her carnal urges, Bethany begins working night
        at an upscale brothel - not for the money, but simply for the thrill of
        it! She lives happily until one night she is recognized by Paul, a
        client of her husband's business. When Paul threatens to blackmail her,
        she decides to tell Frank the truth, hoping he will forgive her. But
        what Frank sees instead is an opportunity to explore his own dark
        fantasies! Will Bethany's secret ruin their marriage, or open the door
        for them to a new era of sexual possibilities?</image:caption
