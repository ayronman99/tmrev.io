        >'Children of the Stars' is the strange but true story of a UFO
        contactee group who relive their past lives on other planets by making
        their own science fiction films. In 1973, Ruth Norman, a 73-year-old
        widow and self described cosmic visionary, purchased 67 acres of land in
        the mountains east of San Diego, California as a landing site for the
        Space Brothers (emissaries from the Intergalactic Confederation). Nearly
        40 years later, a group of dedicated followers still await their
        arrival.</image:caption
