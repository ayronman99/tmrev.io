        >Featuring new and exclusive interviews, Beatles' Biggest Secrets,
        reveals the inside story of the world's greatest pop group with
        explosive revelations about the extraordinary lives of Liverpool's
        favorite sons. From the band's formation and early exposure to the
        gritty world of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll in the dingy strip clubs of
        Hamburg, Germany, the program then travels forward through the Beatles'
        careers with shocking surprises about their relationships with each
        other, their women and their inner circle. Filled with interviews from
        friends, relatives, colleagues and former girlfriends as well as rare
        film footage and original artwork by artist Klaus Voormann, this is the
        first fully rounded Beatles portrait to appear on DVD. This is the
        Beatles at their best -- and their worst!</image:caption
