        >CRITICAL CONDITION paints a disturbing and gripping portrait of what
        can happen when you're sick and uninsured in America. The unforgettable
        subjects of this new documentary by Roger Weisberg discover that being
        uncovered can cost them their jobs, health, homes, savings, and even
        their lives. Unlike Michael Moore's SICKO, which illustrated the
        problems of people with private insurance, CRITICAL CONDITION looks at
        the harrowing struggles of people that must battle life-threatening
        illnesses with no insurance whatsoever.</image:caption
