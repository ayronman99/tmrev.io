        >The 'Arab Spring of 2011' is in full eruption, turmoil consumes the
        Mid-East region as protesters, rebels and insurgents wreak havoc and
        destruction. A Clandestine American Military Agency, 'Black Halo', is
        forced to move a vital asset out of the warzone in Amrakistan. Mike
        McGuirk sends in a Black-Ops team led by Segar to securely extract
        Moshin Dewar and his newest invention. Moshin sensing something is not
        right, escapes Segar by jumping out of a flying plane. Using his device
        to survive, he literally falls into the clutches of a slave mining
        magnate, Anwar the Butcher, now holding Moshin for trespassing on his
        land and destroying one of his vehicles. Segar fails in to negotiate
        with Anwar. McGuirk under extreme pressure from his superiors who fear
        he is losing control of the situation, switches to Plan
        B.</image:caption
