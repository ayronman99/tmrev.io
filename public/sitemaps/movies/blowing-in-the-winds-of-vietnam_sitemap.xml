        >After Misao divorced, she moved to Vietnam. She has always admired the
        country. There, she works as a Japanese language teacher. She learns
        that her brother-in-law is taking her mother with Alzheimer's into a
        facility. Misao decides to take her mother to Vietnam instead. At first,
        her mother is uncomfortable adapting to life in a strange land. Her
        mother comes around though and embraces the warm people in Vietnam. One
        day, her mother is injured and Misao faces the reality in nursing
        her.</image:caption
