        >Eleven years ago, an 8-year-old girl disappeared from a small German
        town on the German-Czech border. Although her body was never found, nor
        were there any traces of blood or DNA evidence, a mentally-disabled man
        was coerced to confess to the crime. Even though he withdrew his
        admission of guilt two days later, the forced confession was enough to
        convince the ruling judge. The responsible investigator Altendorf was
        discharged so that the investigation could be sped along by another
        colleague.</image:caption
