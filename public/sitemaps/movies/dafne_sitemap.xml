        >Dafne has recently lost her mother – and Luigi his wife – in an
        accident. But whilst this 30-year-old, who was born with Down’s
        syndrome, is still managing to master her life with verve after the
        terrible disaster, her father sinks into a depression. It will take all
        the energy Dafne can muster to help him get back on his feet.
        Fortunately, headstrong Dafne happens to have a lot of it up her
        sleeve.</image:caption
