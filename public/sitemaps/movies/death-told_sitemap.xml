        >Four horror stories occur in sequence connected by time and space. The
        first deals with a writer and his wife who move into a large house only
        to find it is already occupied. The second follows three college couples
        on a weekend camping trip where tall tales and legends are more real
        than fiction. The third segment follows a TV crew as they prepare for
        the taping of their hit show, "World's Most Haunted Places". The final
        story is about a hack psychic who discovers that practice really does
        make perfect.</image:caption
