        >A 31-year quest for the Dallas Mavericks and their fans ended on a
        Sunday night in June in Miami as the team hoisted the Larry O Brien NBA
        Championship Trophy, defeating a Miami Heat team many thought were too
        talented to lose. Led by 2011 NBA Finals MVP Dirk Nowitzki, the
        Mavericks overcame the Heat to win the first title in franchise history.
        Relive every moment in this historic series, from an epic 15-point
        comeback on the road in Game 2, to the Jason Terry two huge
        three-pointers down the stretch of Game 5, to an emotional Nowitzki mad
        dash to the locker room after the buzzer sounded in Game 6 confirming
        the Mavericks Championship. Now you can relive this historic series with
        this definitive Collectors Set of 6 DVD. Own each game in its entirety,
        with over 10 hours of content, including exclusive bonus
        features!</image:caption
