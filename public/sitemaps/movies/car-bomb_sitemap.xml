        >Forget about nuclear missiles, the decisive weapon of the twentieth
        century is the car bomb. After Iraq we now know you can defeat a
        Superpower, start a civil war or just blow up your own Government with a
        trunk load of home-made explosives and a battered old car. From the
        Middle East, Oklahoma, Ireland and the streets of the City of London the
        car bomb has shaped human conflict. Even today the car bomb remains the
        number one terrorist threat across the world. In this film, ex-CIA agent
        Robert Baer uncovers the history of this extraordinary weapon. With
        footage of car bomb attacks and interviews with car bombers, Baer
        reveals how the century of the car turned into the century of the car
        bomb. And how a dream of freedom turned nightmare.</image:caption
