        >Olaf, an engineering student, lives with his father Vincent. Once a
        renowned architect, now suffering from early Alzheimer’s disease. Olaf
        is struggling, because he wants to keep seeing Vincent as the man who
        knows everything. In the run-up to the birthday party Olaf organises for
        his dad, their surroundings grow darker; a concrete wall casts a shadow
        over their house from the garden and Vincent’s condition is
        deteriorating. Olaf will have to realise that living together in the
        present is more valuable than persistently clinging on to what used to
        be.</image:caption
