        >told through the eyes of a failed Philadelphia actor who has succumbed
        to drug addiction. Our story follows him during the Holidays as he
        desperately tries to regain everything he has lost in his life; his wife
        and child, his job, and his pride, before it's too late. Over the course
        of one day on New Years Eve in New York City, a young vibrant woman,
        Freebird, shows him how to stand up, discover himself and move on with
        his life.</image:caption
