        >This documentary tells the story of great love, bitter disappointments
        and self-doubts - but most of all of courage. The courage to take risks,
        try something new and be yourself - no matter what age. The film dives
        deeply into the exceptional and heart-warming stories of a group of
        transsexuals and drag queens in their sixties and seventies, who summon
        up their bravery to take to the stage one last time. For two years they
        have been touring in five continents, basking in the success of a
        spectacular show called "Gardenia", directed by Alain Platel and Frank
        Van Laecke. Now, as the show comes to a close, the glamorous aging
        performers must leave the limelight and go home to the quiet lives they
        left behind.</image:caption
