        >Abe Nathan, one of Israel’s most beloved heroes, was a peace advocate,
        a rebel, and a shining example of humanity. He became an international
        sensation in 1966 with his one-man mission for peace that inspired John
        Lennon to immortalize his name in the song “Give Peace a Chance”. He ran
        a pirate radio station, organized humanitarian aid missions and was
        imprisoned for his secret meetings with Palestinian leader Yasser
        Arafat. This profile shows Nathan in his later years, still fighting to
        offer hope in an increasingly hostile world.</image:caption
