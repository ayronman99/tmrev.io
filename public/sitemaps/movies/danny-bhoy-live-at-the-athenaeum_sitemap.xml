        >DANNY BHOY - Live at the Athenaeum is the anticipated follow up to
        Danny's 2007 debut DVD Live at The Opera House. The show, filmed at
        Melbourne's historic Athenaeum Theatre during his sold out tour of
        Australia 2009, promises more memorable tales from the globe-trotting
        Scotsman in his finest performance yet to date. As possibly the
        most-traveled comedian in the world, he describes sometimes in painfully
        funny detail the less glamorous side of a comedian's life on the road.
        Sometimes introspective, occasionally outlandish, these true stories
        from his life are sure to leave you with a smile on your face and
        wanderlust in your heart. The DVD also includes a special unreleased
        ?Visitor?s Guide to Scotland? as well as other extras including TV
        Appearances, Photo Gallery and hidden features.</image:caption
