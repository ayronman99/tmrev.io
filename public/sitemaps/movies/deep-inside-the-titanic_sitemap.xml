        >The Titanic lies in complete darkness, four kilometers beneath the
        ocean. So remote is this famous wreckage that only a small handful of
        explorers and scientists have dared to make the dangerous journey down
        to her decks. However, now we too can explore what is left of the mighty
        ship. Using special remote submersibles to glide through the living
        spaces of the Titanic, viewers witness the current condition of the
        ballrooms, hallways and living quarters of this famous vessel. In
        addition, this unique programme reveals what each room was like before
        the tragedy. On a guided tour of the ship, the stories of the
        inhabitants of each room are told. Around each corner, the grandeur that
        made this ship the pride of the White Star Line brings home the poignant
        story of those who spent their last moments aboard.</image:caption
