        >Khirmohon is an old man and a potter by profession. All his life, he
        has struggled to keep his head above water and now is the owner of his
        own pottery house and a banyan tree. His two sons Satten and Nikhil stay
        in the city and prefer urban life. They have no interest in their
        father's business and want to sell up his life's work for financial
        gain. The silver lining in Khirmohon's life is his granddaughter Poddo,
        who is an eye catching dusky beauty. They stay in their village house
        with another person named Boishakh, who was adopted by Khirmohon when he
        was just a mere child. Boishakh is a passionate character, who is loyal
        to Khirmohon and is more interested in keeping the pottery business
        afloat then Khirmohon's own sons. There is a spark between Poddo and
        Boishakh, but it is not expressed. The story moves forward with Boishakh
        trying to protect the business from going into ruins by unwanted
        invaders and village politics.</image:caption
