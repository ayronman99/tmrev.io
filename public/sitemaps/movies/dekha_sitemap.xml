        >A journey through the life of an aged Bengali poet, Shashibhushan.
        Shashbhushan, now blind, reflects on his past. Stimulated by sounds -
        songs, crows, traffic, and an electronic lighter - he recalls the
        now-vanished arts and literature scene of post independence Calcutta.
        The old man lives in a crumbling aristocratic mansion in the heart of
        town, which he shares with his teacher's daughter, Sarama, and her young
        son Shumon. During a vacation in the country another man enters their
        lives. Gangan was born blind and is a talented singer. Gangan and Sarama
        engage in a secret affair as Shashibhushan recalls his own wife, who he
        lost because of his uncontrollable sexual appetite.</image:caption
