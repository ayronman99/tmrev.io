        >During the Iran-Iraq War, Bashu, a young boy loses his house and all
        his family. Scared, he sneaks into a truck that is leaving the area. He
        gets off the truck in the Northern part of the country, where everything
        from landscape to language is different. He meets Naii, who is trying to
        raise her two young children on a farm, while her husband is away.
        Despite cultural differences, and the fact that they do not speak the
        same language, Bashu and Naii slowly form a strong bond.</image:caption
