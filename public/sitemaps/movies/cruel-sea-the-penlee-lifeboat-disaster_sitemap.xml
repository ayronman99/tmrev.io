        >A moving documentary made to commemorate the twenty-fifth anniversary
        of the Penlee Lifeboat Disaster on 19 December 1981. The eight-man crew
        of the RNLB Solomon Browne, the lifeboat from the Penlee station in
        Mousehole, Cornwall, put to sea in an exceptionally severe gale to
        rescue the five-man crew of the MV Union Star, a cargo ship whose
        engines had failed two miles off the coast and which was in danger of
        being swept onto the rocks. The Solomon Browne was initially able to
        rescue the captain's family and one of the crew from Union Star but, as
        they attempted to rescue the captain and the remaining crewmate, radio
        contact with the Solomon Browne was lost and both crews
        perished.</image:caption
