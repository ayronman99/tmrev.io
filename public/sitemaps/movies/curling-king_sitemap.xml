        >Once a great curling star, Truls Paulsen is diagnosed with
        obsessive-compulsive disorder and banned from competition. But when he
        learns that his old friend and coach Gordon is on his deathbed, Truls,
        heavily-medicated decides to compete again, in the hopes of winning
        money for Gordon to have an operation in the US. Truls stops taking the
        meds and tries to convince his old team mates that he is mentally stable
        enough to lead them to victory in the Norwegian Curling Championship.
        But, is it a good sign that he obsessively insists his teammates pull
        their zippers all the way up before they can play?</image:caption
