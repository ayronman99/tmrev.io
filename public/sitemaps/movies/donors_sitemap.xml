        >Ashley Honors was suppose to meet her friend, Sandra, and a few others
        for drinks. She didn't make it. She wakes up to find herself locked in a
        room with her hands and feet bound with only her purse, a cell phone,
        and a lighter. Ashley works to free herself knowing help is only a call
        away. But, Ashley soon finds that her manipulative, selfish past may
        have left her with no one to believe her plight. Will she find a savior
        on the line before she learns the truth about her fate?</image:caption
