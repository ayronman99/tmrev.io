        >A beautiful young woman is abducted from her place of work and held as
        a sex slave. Two years later, frightened and confused, she manages to
        escape and begins to use meditation to recapture her sensory memories of
        captivity. Finally, she achieves a mental picture of her abductor and,
        realising that he is close at hand, decides to confront him even if it
        means putting her life in danger.</image:caption
