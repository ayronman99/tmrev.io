        >Mila and Javier, both renowned surgeons and both passionate about their
        work, have been madly in love for the past 10 years. They have always
        taken great care to preserve their extraordinary love for each other and
        refuse to succumb to the routine of everyday living. But Milaâ€™s
        unexpected pregnancy, combined with increasing pressure from work at the
        hospital, drives Javier to drink more heavily and he ends up being
        suspended. Faced with his demons, Javier drifts further and further away
        from Mila. Yet, when their relationship is under serious threat, Javier
        is ready to do whatever it takes to win Mila back.</image:caption
