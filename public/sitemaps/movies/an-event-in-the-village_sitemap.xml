        >An event in the village 2010, features amateur filmmaker Frank Rigby.
        Frank shot footage of the Bickershaw festival in 1972. This footage
        serves as the visual foundations for the film, An event in the village.
        We see Frankâ€™s original footage as we hear him describing the recording
        of the event 35 years after it happened. The Bickershaw festival was the
        last 3 day festival in the north west of England. The Kinks, Captain
        Beefheart and the Grateful Dead all played during the weekend. This work
        investigates memory and documentary - the gaps between event, actuality,
        recording and memory. Frank speaks with great fondness about his village
        and its takeover by Hippies over a long weekend in May
        1972.</image:caption
