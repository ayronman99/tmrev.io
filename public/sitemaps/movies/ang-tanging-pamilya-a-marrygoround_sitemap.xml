        >A story of a young couple, Charlie Sicat and U.S.-based Prince Price,
        who decides to get married after two years of long-distance
        relationship. But there is one hitch: Charlie’s father Dindo had
        promised to give his wife Sunshine another church ceremony to mark their
        25th wedding anniversary. Dindo vehemently refuses to have both weddings
        take place. Prince’s attempt to win over Dindo is further complicated by
        his nouveau riche mother Marlene, who insists on having her son’s
        wedding done her way.</image:caption
