        >We are taken though the principal milestones of Hopper's biography,
        including his debut start in Hollywood, the meeting with James Dean and
        the influence he played upon him, his insubordination on sets and
        conflicts with the Hollywood directors which led to his black-listing,
        the years in New, the making of 'Easy Rider' (with an interesting
        connection of the ultimate road movie with the French new wave
        directors), 'Apocalypse Now', 'Blue Velvet', 'Colors', his fight with
        dependency on drugs and alcohol. We come to know Hopper as a complex
        artist, a valuable photographer who had always a camera on him and whose
        portraits or American life shots figure among the best in the genre, but
        also a rebel painter (who may still be rediscovered and become famous in
        posterity) and exquisite art collector.</image:caption
