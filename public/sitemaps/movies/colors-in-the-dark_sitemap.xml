        >Anita and Fred have been a couple for 50 years, and happily married for
        nearly as long. They have two grown children, and their grandchildren
        are finishing school. Both can look back at a fulfilling past, but their
        lives are still rich and vibrant. The fact that Fred is terribly ill has
        been hidden from the family. For the first time in all these years, Fred
        takes some liberties, which his wife interprets as an affront. Never
        before has she felt so abandoned. Although she starts to question her
        relationship, a love like theirs cannot end so easily. Indeed it should
        never end.</image:caption
