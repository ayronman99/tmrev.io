        >Japanese anime is the biggest thing to come out of the East since
        Godzilla. It's featured on clothing, television, video games and for
        some, has become a way of life. With the introduction of popular anime
        series as Pokemon and Sailor Moon, some anime fans have taken their
        infatuation to the extreme. They spend hours reading comic books,
        playing video games, making character costumes, and even attending anime
        conferences. Animania examines the why's and how's of the teen obsession
        with anime and what it means for the future of pop
        culture.</image:caption
