        >Alison, a teen, is facing pregnancy. With nowhere to turn, she finds
        herself in a "clinic" about to end her baby's life. Suddenly a man
        appears. His mop tells her he's the janitor. Conversation begins and it
        quickly becomes clear that this man is no mere janitor, but Jesus
        manifest. And he's come to save the life of her baby.</image:caption
