        >Starting a new life in a quiet Pennsylvania town, Matthew Michaels only
        thought is to turn an old farm property into a profitable car
        dealership. He soon discovers that beneath the gentle surface, this
        small town is anything but calm and peaceful. Firstly, he learns that
        his new property is located on the site of a graveyard, which all the
        townsfolk regard as an evil place that must never be visited. He then
        discovers that years earlier the town had suffered an infestation of the
        living dead ...zombies who prey on human flesh. One zombie, the infamous
        Abbot Hayes, escaped destruction. As the construction team begin
        degging, they unleash the thing the townsfolk fear the most, the wrath
        of Abbot Hayes and the awakening of ... The Children of the Living
        Dead.</image:caption
