        >A Woman of Paris (1923) was the first film Chaplin made for United
        Artists Film Corporation, which he founded with his friends Mary
        Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks and D. W. Griffith. Chaplin had long
        considered making a dramatic feature. For the first time, he decided to
        direct. Actress and filmmaker Liv Ullmann analyses the film. She talks
        about the acting, the originality of the characterizations, as well as
        the "feminine" viewpoint Chaplin adopted for the first time in his
        films.</image:caption
