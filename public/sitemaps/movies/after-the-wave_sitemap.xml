        >The Boxing Day Tsunami in 2004 was the most devastating natural
        disaster in modern times, killing 228,000 people across 13 countries in
        just a few hours. AFTER THE WAVE tells the untold story of this epic
        forensic operation in Thailand to identify and return home the bodies of
        over 5,000 victims, both locals and holidaymakers from around the world.
        Led by a crack Australian team, the best forensic specialists from
        around the world were in a race against time to give back every victim
        their identity. Creating forensic history, the international team’s
        mantra from the outset was ‘we will take them home’, a seemingly
        impossible ambition but one that almost succeeded. In this film forensic
        science intersects with powerful stories of survival and loss,
        attempting to make some sense out of a tragedy so bewilderingly complete
        that nearly a decade out it still seems far-fetched to most of
        us.</image:caption
