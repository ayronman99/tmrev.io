        >Ali: An American Hero is an American television movie which aired on
        August 31, 2000 on FOX. It chronicles portions of the career of
        heavyweight boxer Muhammad Ali, who is portrayed by David Ramsey.
        Cassius Clay (David Ramsey), winner of the gold medal for boxing in the
        light heavyweight division at the 1960 Summer Olympics, rises in the
        professional ranks and defeats heavyweight boxing champion Sonny Liston
        in a stunning upset to capture the title in 1964. Controversy surrounds
        his decision to join the Nation of Islam, his name change from Cassius
        Clay to Muhammad Ali, his friendship with Malcolm X (Joe Morton), and
        his conscientious objection to the draft during the Vietnam War.
        Stripped of his title, he eventually recaptures it in 1974 in the
        so-called "Rumble in the Jungle"â€”an epic bout against George Foreman in
        Zaire.</image:caption
