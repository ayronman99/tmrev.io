        >BALD is the tale of Andrew Wood, a second year university student whose
        grades are receding faster than his hairline. He hits rock bottom when
        he finds out that hes been kicked out of school. In an effort to
        increase his own self esteem and erase his insecurity about losing his
        hair, Andrew and his best friend Max start an online internet business
        with all of the girls at college.</image:caption
