        >DeeDee returns to her hometown with her 11 year old son, Trooper, 13
        years after she ran off with her boyfriend. Her childhood best friend,
        Sam, is now married and he and his wife, Lydia, are the town's
        veterinarians. Lydia is a little wary about DeeDee after Sam tells her
        that they were best friends growing up and DeeDee was his first crush.
        But DeeDee and Trooper find their way into many hearts of the
        townspeople with their sweet helpfulness and friendships. DeeDee sets up
        a candle making business in town square and invites many of the ladies
        of the town to weekly candle making parties, and through these parties
        she and Lydia become good friends. One evening after dinner with Lydia
        and Sam, DeeDee tells Sam she's very sick and she doesn't have much
        longer to live and she needs his help to find a good family in town to
        adopt Trooper. Sam later tells Lydia everything and they decide to adopt
        Trooper themselves if/when something happens to DeeDee.</image:caption
