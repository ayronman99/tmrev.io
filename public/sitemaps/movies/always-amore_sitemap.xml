        >The movie centers around Elizabeth who, with the support of her
        mother-in-law Nonna, is doing everything she can to keep her late
        husband’s once acclaimed — but now struggling — Italian restaurant
        afloat. With business going downhill, she is forced to work with a
        professional restaurant consultant, Ben, to see if they can turn things
        around. At first, Elizabeth resists the changes Ben believes will save
        the restaurant, but as they get closer, Elizabeth realizes that not all
        change is bad. She rediscovers her passion for baking and might even
        open her heart to new love.</image:caption
