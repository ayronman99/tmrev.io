        >Camille wanders through the countryside talking with frogs and
        chickens: she sails through life as a carefree soul. But for her older
        sister, the introverted Mylia, things are more complicated. Mylia is
        lost between the uncertainty in her family life, the superficial
        atmosphere at her new school and her first experiences at house parties.
        It is Camille who eventually introduces Mylia to Jimmy. The boy from the
        nearby Abenaki reserve is different and he encourages her to break
        free.</image:caption
