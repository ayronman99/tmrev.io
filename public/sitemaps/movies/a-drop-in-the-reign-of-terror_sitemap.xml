        >“A … film about terrorism, injustice, lies, corruption and love. … The
        widow Matara Harmine and her three children live in fear of terrorist
        activities by both the rebels and the internal security service. Matara
        suspects that the rich and corrupt businessman Akmon knows more about
        the disappearance and death of her husband. Akmon has supplied weapons
        to the rebels, to ensure he can continue his illegal activities without
        too many problems. Contrasting with this relationship filled with
        mistrust, are Matara's daughter Panduka and Akmon's son Manjula: they
        are in love with each other. The relationships between the two families
        become increasingly complicated. … The many characters and vicissitudes
        - occasionally reminiscent of a soap series are characteristic of
        Sri-Lankan cinema.” - IFFR</image:caption
