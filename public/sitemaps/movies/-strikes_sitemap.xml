        >Brian Hooks plays a character who is just released from jail. And the
        state adopts a "3 strikes" rule for felons that involves serious
        penalties. Hooks has 2 strikes, and wants to change his life for the
        better. When a friend picks him up, they are pulled over, and his friend
        shoots at police officers, and Hooks escapes. Now Hooks, a wanted man,
        must clear his name of having nothing to do with the
        shooting.</image:caption
