        >Recently dumped by his girlfriend, underachiever Alex (O'Nan) embarks
        on an impromptu road trip with his new bandmate, the eccentric Jim
        (Michael Weston). By channeling their inner children and giving a new
        meaning to the term "lo-fi," Alex and Jim find their unique style by
        bringing the sound of children's instruments to their unsuspecting fans.
        Playing a series of bizarre shows and experiencing multiple
        near-disasters, Alex and Jim's persistence takes them on a true
        coming-of-age journey</image:caption
