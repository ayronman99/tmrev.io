        >Roy is a professional conman, who has raised his work to the level of
        an art. The only true thing he has is his love for Simmi someone who is
        so rooted, honest and sincere, that he can't bring himself to tell her
        the reality of who he is. But when his past catches up with him, she
        cannot forgive him for the deceit their relationship is built on. He
        loses her forever. That's when Aditya Srivastav enters the picture. He
        is the counterpoint to everything that Roy is as frantic as Roy is calm,
        as dumb as Roy is smart, as messy and untidy as Roy is smooth. They have
        only one thing in common. Aditya is a conman too. At least he thinks of
        himself as one. In Roy's book, he's an embarrassment. But one that won't
        go away!</image:caption
