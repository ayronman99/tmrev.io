        Montreux than Deep Purple and there was simply no other contender when
        it came to choosing the act to headline the closing night of the 40th
        Festival in 2006. In response the band delivered one of their finest
        concerts including a show-stopping performance of "Smoke on the Water".
        As an added bonus. The DVD and Blu-ray features the whole of Deep
        Purple's 60 minute show at London's Hard Rock Cafe earlier in the same
        year.</image:caption
