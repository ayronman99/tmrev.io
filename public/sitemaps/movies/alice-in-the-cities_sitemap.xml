        >German journalist Philip Winter has a case of writer’s block when
        trying to write an article about the United States. He decides to return
        to Germany, and while trying to book a flight, encounters a German woman
        and her nine year old daughter Alice doing the same. The three become
        friends (almost out of necessity) and while the mother asks Winter to
        mind Alice temporarily, it quickly becomes apparent that Alice will be
        his responsibility for longer than he expected. After returning to
        Europe, the innocent friendship between Winter and Alice grows as they
        travel together through various European cities on a quest for Alice’s
        grandmother.</image:caption
