        >Pasquale Marrazzo directs this understated, gritty look at a trio of
        young people struggling to make their own lives in the face of terrible
        odds. Giovanni is a young man from a poor family, eking out a living as
        a gas station attendant. His twin brother Moreno has Down's syndrome and
        lives in an institution. Giovanni's girlfriend Betty lives with her
        dissolute mother and her mom's thuggish, lecherous boyfriend. When he
        learns that the institution put his brother up for adoption, Giovanni is
        indignant, vowing to bring him under his family's care. More than
        willing to escape her mother and the casual pawings of her lover, Betty
        moves with Giovanni. Giovanni's single-minded struggle to claim legal
        guardianship over Moreno suddenly gives the two a direction in life and
        soon a family of sorts forms.</image:caption
