        >The oldest primate laboratory in the world, located in the enchanting
        former Soviet republic of Abkhazia, was virtually destroyed during its
        struggle for independence from Georgia. But the lab workers refuse to
        give up their lab and have come up with a new idea to restore it to its
        former pride and glory. With the help of their renowned former director
        Professor Lapin they hope to put their institute back on the map. The
        Lost Colony follows their efforts, made with boundless confidence and
        unwavering hope, against all odds.</image:caption
