        >When a musical composer suffers from writer’s block, what can he do? So
        Joon (Lee Hee Joon) blames his creative block on his romantic dry spell
        in recent years. So he decides to buy a machine known as the “Cupid
        Factory.” By using his new machine, he meets up with Shi Yoon (Park Soo
        Jin), his former girlfriend who is now a popular singer. But is there a
        side effect to the Cupid Factory that So Joon doesn’t know about? “Cupid
        Factory” is a 2011 drama special directed by Kim Hyung
        Suk.</image:caption
