        >A trio of ruthless killers seeks refuge in a quiet suburban home, only
        to discover a destructive force that could spell their doom in this
        blood-drenched frightener from director James Tucker. They thought they
        had found the perfect hideout, but what they didn't realize was that
        they had entered into the home of a truly terrifying family. But the
        folks downstairs are the least of their worries, because by the time
        these sadistic beasts discover the unearthly powers of the woman who
        dwells on the third floor, it's already too late for any hope of
        survival.</image:caption
