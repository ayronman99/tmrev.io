        >In the 1980s, the Korean student movement generated powerful
        anti-American feelings in Korean society. The director wonders why it
        should be - despite this sentiment - that Korean women continue to marry
        American GIs. In addition, he is curious about what their life is like
        after their wedding day. Ajuma is a former prostitute who married an
        American soldier and now lives in New Jersey. From their first meeting
        until the last, the film project is in danger of being undermined by the
        conflict between the director and Ajuma. The contrast between the two
        finally turns into the subject of the documentary. In the story, which
        is told in an unorthodox way, both of them finally reveal
        themselves.</image:caption
