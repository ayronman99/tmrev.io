        >The first in a series of videos investigating the use of digital
        effects on appropriated imagery, "Painting" Sites compiles pictures
        arbitrarily yielded by an Internet search for the word "Painting," and
        peppers the resulting series of images with digital graffiti, courtesy
        of editing software. When Price began the piece, in 2000, automated
        image-search tools did not yet exist online; instead, the artist used
        text-based searches, taking arbitrary screenshots of each and every page
        that was returned and then cropping out all but the image, an approach
        that occasionally yielded visual hallmarks like improperly loaded data
        or the appearance of the cursor.</image:caption
