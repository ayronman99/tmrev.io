        >Adapted from the successful play, the film takes place in 19th-century
        Japan, where a war between demons and their slayers is fought. Izumo, a
        kabuki actor with a demon-slaying past, meets and falls in love with
        Tsubaki. However, something is not right, as mysterious marks appear on
        her body as time progresses. At the same time, it is announced that
        Ashura, the queen of all demons, will be resurrected and bring
        destruction to the universe.</image:caption
