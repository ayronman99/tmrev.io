        >Winston Churchill understood the power of films, but the true extent of
        his use of cinema as a propaganda tool is rarely explored. In 1934, one
        of Britain's most celebrated film producers, Alexander Korda, signed
        Churchill up as a screenwriter and historical advisor. It was the start
        of a unique collaboration. Churchill provided script notes for Korda's
        productions and penned an epic screenplay. When war broke out, their
        collaboration took on national importance. Korda was sent on a mission
        to Hollywood to help bring America into the war, with positive results.
        With access to previously undiscovered documents, this film documentary
        examines that mission and a friendship that underpinned a unique,
        creative partnership.</image:caption
