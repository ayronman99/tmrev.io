        >Fifteen years after their father was gunned down in cold blood, Cashius
        and Winston Hurley return to their hometown to avenge his death. Joining
        forces with their cousin Bugsy, the two gun-slinging brothers hunt down
        everyone involved in their father's murder. As the bullets fly and the
        death toll rises, the three young cowboys find themselves fugitives from
        the law, running for their lives and fighting for their
        revenge.</image:caption
