        >Max is a battle-weary veteran of the wedding-planning racket. His
        latest — and last — gig is a hell of a fête, involving stuffy period
        costumes for the caterers, a vain, hyper- sensitive singer who thinks
        he's a Gallic James Brown, and a morose, micromanaging groom determined
        to make Max's night as miserable as possible. But what makes the affair
        too bitter to endure is that Max's colleague and ostensible girlfriend,
        Joisette, seems to have written him off, coolly going about her
        professional duties while openly flirting with a much younger server.
        It's going to be a very long night… especially once the groom's aerial
        serenade gets underway.</image:caption
