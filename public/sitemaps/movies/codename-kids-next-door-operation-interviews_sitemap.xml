        >In a series of interviews with the KND after they're all grown up, the
        former operatives are temporarily brought out of their decommissioned
        haze to discuss what happened during their very last mission with Numbuh
        one - where he disappeared and was never heard from again! It all
        started with a routine mission to get the Delightful Children's birthday
        cake, but when a mysterious boy steals it instead, he makes it available
        to whoever wants it, IF they can solve his 'simple' scavenger hunt
        first. Soon it's a mad, mad, mad, mad chase around the world as the KND,
        their friends, and virtually all of their enemies compete to win the
        yummiest cake ever</image:caption
