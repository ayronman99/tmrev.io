        >Jonathan Reeves is tasked with infusing more contemporary styles and
        modernism into the American Ballet Academy, and enlists his top
        choreographers Charlie, Cooper and Tommy to recruit dancers to compete
        at a camp where the winners will be selected to join the Academy. Bella
