        >Inside of an impoverished community in Chicago, Illinois, an
        ex-convicted felon, “Marcus Julian” returns from prison after eight
        years incarcerated. A product of a failed family structure, Marcus, like
        so many others in his community, functioned under a “street-code” of
        savagery. The “Gangster Disciples” governed the territories, and as a
        former outstanding member he lived in ongoing regret of the mob-related
        acts that led him to prison.</image:caption
