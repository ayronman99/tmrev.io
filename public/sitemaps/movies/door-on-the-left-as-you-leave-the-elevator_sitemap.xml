        >Yan is a successful artist. One day he is waiting for his date Florence
        to turn up at his apartment. As the doorbell rings, he finds another
        young woman in underwear on his doorstep: his neighbor Eva! She tells
        him she locked herself out of her apartment and insists that he helps
        her. Whilst Yan is trying to enter Eva's apartment via their adjoining
        balcony, his phone rings. It is Florence, and she is not impressed when
        a female voice answers the phone. At this point, Eva's rabidly jealous
        boyfriend Boris returns home. Seeing Yan in his apartment, he deduces
        that Eva has been having an affair behind his back. Florence then turns
        up and Yan tries in vain to explain the situation. By chance, Florence's
        husband suddenly puts in an appearance. After that, it all starts to get
        a bit complicated.</image:caption
