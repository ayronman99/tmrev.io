        >Louis Ortiz, a down on his luck 40-something Puerto Rican resident of
        the Bronx, looks in the mirror one day and believes he’s found gold—he’s
        a dead ringer for Barack Obama. With visions of finally living the
        American Dream, the charismatic Ortiz launches a complete makeover. He
        dons Obama’s trademark suit, adopts his mannerisms, mimics his voice and
        steps out onto the street as a presidential impersonator. Taken on by a
        casting agent, Ortiz and a gang of other political impersonators,
        including a Bill Clinton and a Mitt Romney, hit the road during the
        run-up to the 2012 presidential election to perform satirical debates
        for mostly Republican conventions, throwing Ortiz into conflict with his
        personal political beliefs. As Ortiz struggles to make ends meet, the
        distance between the White House and the Bronx becomes increasingly
        acute. The life of a president isn’t always as easy as it
        looks.</image:caption
