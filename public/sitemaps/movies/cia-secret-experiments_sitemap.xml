        >It's the height of the Cold War and the United States government is
        desperate to combat the spread of Communism. The CIA launches a highly
        classified, top secret research program into the covert use of
        biological and chemical agents. In simulated attacks on enemy
        populations, entire cities in America are contaminated with bacteria,
        exposing millions of Americans to germ warfare. But the real focus of
        the research is on mastering the art of mind control. Psychiatrists at
        top academic institutions work under secret contract with the agency.
        Psychiatric patients, prisoners, even unwitting members of the public
        are exposed to a startling array of experiments designed to facilitate
        interrogations, induce amnesia and program in new behavior. Every
        psychological technique is explored, including hypnosis, electroshock
        therapy and lethal cocktails of drugs. What was the extent of these
        brainwashing experiments? How did the CIA become involved in such
        far-reaching and disturbing research?</image:caption
