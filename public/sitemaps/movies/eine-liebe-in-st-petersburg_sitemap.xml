        >The young Berlin anesthesiologist Nora is facing exciting times: her
        partner Eric makes her a marriage proposal and she has the opportunity
        to give her first important speech at an international congress in St.
        Petersburg. Nora goes to Russia, where she gets a frosty reception. The
        Russian pediatrician Andrej, who has been assigned to her as a personal
        companion, is not very enthusiastic about this task. So he puts Nora in
        a taxi soon. But then Nora is attacked and Andrej plagues his guilty
        conscience. Soon, the people are coming closer to the
        fight.</image:caption
