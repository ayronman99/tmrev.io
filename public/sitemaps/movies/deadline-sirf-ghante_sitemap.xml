        >Heart surgeon Dr. Viren Goenka, his wife Sanjana and their
        seven-year-old daughter Anishka live in Mumbai. Their joys have just
        multiplied with Viren being honored with a prestigious award for his
        contribution to the medical world. Viren is all set to visit New Delhi
        to receive this award. He promises to celebrate his daughter's birthday
        once he returns. But fate has something else planned for Viren and his
        family: Anishka is kidnapped under Sanjana's nose. She is startled with
        the presence of a creepy man named Krish in her house. Krish tells her
        that Anishka will be fine as long as Sanjana and Dr. Goenka follow his
        instructions.</image:caption
