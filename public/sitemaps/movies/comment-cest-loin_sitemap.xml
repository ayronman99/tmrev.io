        >After ten years of doing nothing, Orel and Gringe are in their mid 30s
        and they struggle to finish their first rap album. Their texts are
        mostly sex jokes and booze stories and reflect the everyday life they
        have in a small town from France. The problem is that they never really
        finished a song and when their producers want to meet, they have to face
        a new challenge : finish their first song in the next 24h. Their old
        issues, the fear of failure, their alcoholic friends and annoying
        girlfriends won't help them to do so, or will they ?</image:caption
