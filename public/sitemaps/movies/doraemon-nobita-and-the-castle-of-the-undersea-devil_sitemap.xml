        >Nobita and his friends under the waters of the Pacific Ocean. Gian and
        Suneo take Doraemon's underwater vehicle and travel through the Atlantic
        Ocean, trying to find a treasure ship. Along the way, they discover that
        the environment gun that Doraemon used to protect them is running out of
        energy leaving them vulnerable to the sea. Fortunately, they are rescued
        by some marine creatures.</image:caption
