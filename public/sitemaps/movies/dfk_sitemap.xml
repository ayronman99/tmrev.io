        >Cameron Duncan wrote, directed and starred in this short film, the same
        year a lump in his knee turned out to be cancerous. Aged only 16, Duncan
        had already showcased his filmmaking talents on a series of
        award-winning short pieces made for Fair Go's annual programme devoted
        to commercials. With DFK6498, he channels his recent experiences into a
        short, stylishly-shot memoir of incarceration, frustration and freedom
        lost. The film went on to win a trio of awards at Wanganui's River City
        Film Festival and win praise from director Peter Jackson.</image:caption
