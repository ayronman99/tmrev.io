        >A well-known middle-aged director who reached the top of the world
        cinema, won an Oscar and is now a pathetic drinker who lives in a stale
        apartment at the expense of a young woman. A brilliant young pianist who
        in his youth expected him to climb to the top of world music and is now
        a dangerous and wanted criminal. A senior doctor in the hospital, a drug
        addict, who must wait patiently for surgery until his hands stop
        shaking. A young nurse whose parents, in which she nursed, abused her
        and lamented that she had to die in the place of her soldier brother.
        Everyone meets when a poor film producer arrives and invites the
        director out of the gutter and write a script for him. The film, as well
        as the screenplay written by the director, track these lost souls
        crossing each other's paths in the no-go paths in which they
        roam.</image:caption
