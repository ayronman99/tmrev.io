        >Romance meets farce against the backdrop of a quiet campaign to
        legalize gay marriage. Laurent loves his roommate Dan, who's straight
        and a playboy. Laurent can't bring himself to tell Dan, but is content
        to share a flat and to party with him. Then Camille comes along, Dan
        falls hard, and Laurent is beside himself: he tries to sabotage the
        relationship, but each effort backfires. After Dan moves in with
        Camille, Laurent enlists the help of Sam, his new lesbian flatmate, and
        Nick, a long-time gay friend. As the lovers head toward marriage,
        Laurent becomes more desperate. His efforts may be having an effect, if
        not on Dan, then on Camille. Which love will triumph?</image:caption
