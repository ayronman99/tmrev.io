        >When Mr. and Mrs. Myers move into their highly coveted Beverly Hills
        home, they wonder why the price tag is too good to be true. Their
        daughter, Danielle, discovers the truth when a neighbor tells her one of
        the previous owners was murdered there years ago. When Danielle falls
        prey to the hauntings of the ghostly victim who lived there, Danni's
        dream home turns into the house from hell after she is tortured and
        attacked by the evil apparition. After Danielle's cries go unheard by
        her oblivious parents, she realizes she must get out of the house as
        quickly as possible or she is going to be the next victim of an even
        greater threat.</image:caption
