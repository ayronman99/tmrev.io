        >The true story of lifelong criminal and serial killer, Carl Panzram who
        wrote his autobiography for a jail guard in 1928. Carl Panzram was a
        lifelong prisoner and a hate-filled serial killer. Brutalized in and out
        of various U.S. state prisons during 20th century America, Panzram
        unleashed a rampage of revenge that resulted in over 20 murders and
        countless acts of violent sodomy. A single act of kindness, by prison
        guard Henry Lesser, sparked a friendship that eventually influenced
        Panzram to write his autobiography. In 1930, Panzram was hanged for
        killing a laundry foreman at Leavenworth prison.</image:caption
