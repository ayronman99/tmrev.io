        >Call + Response is a first of its kind feature documentary film that
        reveals the worldâ€™s 27 million dirtiest secrets: there are more slaves
        today than ever before in human history. Call + Response goes deep
        undercover where slavery is thriving from the child brothels of Cambodia
        to the slave brick kilns of rural India to reveal that in 2007, Slave
        Traders made more money than Google, Nike and Starbucks combined.
        Luminaries on the issue and many other prominent political and cultural
        figures offer first hand account of this 21st century trade.
        Performances from Grammy-winning and critically acclaimed artists move
        this chilling information into inspiration for stopping it. Music is
        part of the movement against human slavery. Dr. Cornel West connects the
        music of the American slave fields to the popular music we listen to
        today, and offers this connection as a rallying cry for the modern
        abolitionist movement currently brewing.</image:caption
