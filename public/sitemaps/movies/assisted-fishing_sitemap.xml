        >Dewey Winfield is a lovable loser who wants nothing more than to beat
        the guy who has bullied him his whole life in a big fishing tournament.
        In order to win, Dewey will need the help of some eccentric senior
        citizens who are about to be evicted from their assisted living home.
        When they all go fishing, comedy ensues - tragedy strikes - and Dewey
        discovers that his hopes and dreams of winning the fishing tournament
        may not be the most important thing in life after all.</image:caption
