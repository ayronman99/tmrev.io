        >ARITA is a short film told in pictures and in small moments. It is
        about a girl whose first friend is a small drawing named Arita, a cute
        nosed endearment she found everywhere. From her notebooks to her
        illustrations and school supplies, Arita appeared silently and still.
        Growing up with such a friend would raise questions and as she became
        older, she attempted to answer them. Iwai, one of Japanâ€™s most exciting
        directors, tells a beautiful and dream-like story through the precious
        eyes of Ryoko Hirosue. The heavenly tint of the picture and the serene
        piano playing makes ARITA easily an audience favorite.</image:caption
