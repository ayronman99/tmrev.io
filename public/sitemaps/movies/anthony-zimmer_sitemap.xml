        >In Paris, the international police force and the Russian mafia are
        chasing Anthony Zimmer, an intelligent man responsible for laundry of
        dirty money in France. Zimmer had extensive plastic surgery, and his new
        face and voice are completely unknown. The only means to reach Zimmer is
        through his beloved mistress Chiara, who is under surveillance of the
        police and the mobsters. While traveling by train to the country nearby
        Nice, the common man Fran√ßois Taillandier, who has the same body shape
        of Zimmer, is select by Chiara as if he were Zimmer and used as a bait
        to lure those that are pursuing her. When Taillandier is chased by the
        professional Russian killers, he runs the French police when the real
        situation begins to be disclosed to him. Written by Claudio Carvalho,
