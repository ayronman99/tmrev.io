        >Griffith Townsend (Michael Fredianelli) enjoys a successful career as
        senior editor at the San Francisco Chronicle with only one problem: he
        is plagued with amnesia. With the help of a washed-up psychologist (Ray
        Medved), he reluctantly unearths a number of odd habits which can only
        be described as unnatural and bizarre. Meanwhile, a strange woman,
        Maggie (Kat Reichmuth), awakens in Golden Gate Park with no
        recollections of how she arrived. Enlisting the aid of a friendly social
        worker (William McMichael) and local gypsy (Selenia Mason), she slowly
        begins to recall her true identity. With an increasing and unexpected
        desire consuming her, it becomes clear that Griffith and Maggie's new
        obsessions may be more than just memory loss as they become a dangerous
        and deadly threat to the city and each other.</image:caption
