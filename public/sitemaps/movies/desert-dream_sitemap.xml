        >This film takes place in a remote area, a desert region situated
        somewhere between the Mongolia and Chinese border. The town has become
        nearly void of all inhabitants except for Hangai, who works obsessively
        to plant trees in the desert area. Hangai’s own wife has recently left
        him, as their daughter became increasingly ill. While Hangai wallows in
        solitude, a North Korean refugee arrives at his doorstep with her son.
        They ask for shelter and Hanghai obliges. Although the trio can’t even
        speak a common language, they are able to communicate nonethless and
        work together to plant trees. It seems Hanghai is attracted to Soon Hee,
        but she doesn’t feel quite the same way. Then a Mongolian soldier
        stationed at a nearby camp, befriends the trio and the dynamics of their
        relationship start to change.</image:caption
