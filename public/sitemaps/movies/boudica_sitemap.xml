        >The Celtic queen who shook the Roman Empire. Boudica is one of
        history’s first and fiercest women warriors. Sickened by ceaseless war,
        the king of the Iceni accepts a treaty with the Romans in exchange for
        his tribe’s continued independence. But oppressively high taxes
        impoverish the tribe and soon the Romans want something more — slaves.
        Refusing to submit, the Romans, led by the greedy and psychotic Emperor
        Nero, move to crush the Iceni and control their lands. Drawing on the
        strength of her warriors, mystical druidic powers, and her own pain,
        Boudica unites the historically fractious tribes of Briton to unleash a
        stunning onslaught on the Roman colonial camps. The ferocity of
        Boudica’s attacks will shake the foundations of the Roman empire and
        make her a legend.</image:caption
