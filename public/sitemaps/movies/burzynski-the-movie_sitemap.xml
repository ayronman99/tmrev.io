        >Burzynski, the Movie is the story of a medical doctor and Ph.D
        biochemist named Dr. Stanislaw Burzynski who won the largest, and
        possibly the most convoluted and intriguing legal battle against the
        Food &amp; Drug Administration in American history. His victorious
        battles with the United States government were centered around Dr.
        Burzynski's gene-targeted cancer medicines he discovered in the 1970's
        called Antineoplastons, which have currently completed Phase II
        FDA-supervised clinical trials in 2009 and could begin the final phase
        of FDA testing in 2011â€“barring the ability to raise the required $300
        million to fund the final phase of FDA clinical trials.</image:caption
