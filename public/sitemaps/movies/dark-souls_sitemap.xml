        >A young girl, Johanna, is attacked and seemingly murdered. Her father
        receives a phone call from the police pronouncing her dead as he sees
        her walk in the front door of their house. Strange things begin to
        happen to Johanna; she is disorientated and becomes pale and
        unresponsive. Similar attacks begin to happen, and Johannaâ€™s father
        takes it on himself to find out the truth. He embarks on a dark thrill
        ride of lost memories, conspiracy, and zombie-like symptoms. Finding the
        mysterious darkness within is the source of the bizarre world he has
        uncovered.</image:caption
