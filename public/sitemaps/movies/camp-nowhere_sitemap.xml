        >Morris "Mud" Himmel has a problem. His parents desperately want to send
        him away to summer camp. He hates going to summer camp, and would do
        anything to get out of it. Talking to his friends, he realizes that they
        are all facing the same sentence: a boring summer camp. Together with
        his friends, he hatches a plan to trick all the parents into sending
        them to a camp of their own design.</image:caption
