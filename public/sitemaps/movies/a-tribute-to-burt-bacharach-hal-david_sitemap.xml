        >Pop music wouldn't be the same without one of the world's best-loved
        songwriting teams - Burt Bacharach and Hal David. With Bacharach's
        passionate melodies and David's heartfelt lyrics, they gave us hit after
        hit, including "Close To You," What The World Needs Now Is Love,"
        "Alfie." "Do You Know The Way To San Jose" and many, many others.
        Performing 25 of the pair's truly timeless classics, a stunning galaxy
        of internationally renowned performers paid tribute to the pair in grand
        style at London's Royal Albert Hall, From Dionne Warwick singing the
        hits she helped make so popular to Elvis Costello teaming with Bacharach
        on the piano to Bacharach and David in a rare appearance together on
        stage, the evening was a magical night to remember.</image:caption
