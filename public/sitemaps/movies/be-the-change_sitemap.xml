        >Be the Change is a documentary that makes stars out of ordinary people
        who are trying to live more sustainably. What motivates these local
        heroes? The challenges and rewards are revealed as they try to live more
        lightly, or more sustainably. It is a celebration of the human spirit.
        What it will take to get everybody else on board? Avoiding both
        preaching and scare tactics, Be the Change attempts to answer such
        questions as: What does living lightly look like? Who is doing it? What
        do they get out of it? Does it hurt? Is it enough? Can all of us give it
        a try?</image:caption
