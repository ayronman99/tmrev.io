        >Jake Groden is the black sheep of his family. Ankle deep in fish guts,
        he serves out his parole in Alaska. Then, after a decade of self-imposed
        exile, he is forced to return to his Brooklyn family. He soon discovers
        that his perfect brother, Michael is dead, and he begins trying to take
        what Michael had- a beautiful wife, adoring son, control of the family
        furniture business and the love of their gruff father. For Jake, the
        price of a new life is his identity.</image:caption
