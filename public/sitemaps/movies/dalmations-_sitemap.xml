        >The three little Dalmatians lived with an old lady just outside of
        town. One day they overheard the neighbor talking about a market selling
        gingerbread, cotton candy and many other goodies. "Gingerbread," beamed
        Krümel. "Our old lady loves to eat gingerbread!" "Me too," said the
        icing on the cake. "We'll go to the market and get a gingerbread heart,"
        suggested Krümel. “And then we'll give it to our old lady for her
        birthday.” But the trader in the market had no sympathy for three little
        Dalmatians who just wanted to put their gingerbread hearts in their
        pockets. He called the police and had the dogs taken to an animal
        shelter. Only the icing on the cake could escape and she decided to free
        her friends.</image:caption
