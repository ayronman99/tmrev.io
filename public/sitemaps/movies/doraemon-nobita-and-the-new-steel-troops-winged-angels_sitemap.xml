        >The title character, Nobita, is upset because he cannot get a large RC
        toy to show off to a rich boy, Suneo. His fit makes Doraemon angry, and
        with the hot Japanese summer, he decides to "cool off" at the North Pole
        with the Anywhere Door, a mysterious portal. Nobita follows him there
        after he's gone for a long time, and discovers a strange bowling
        ball-like orb which starts blinking with a pulsating light, and summons
        what looks like a giant robotÂ´s foot. After sledding down the hill on it
        and having it crash into his room through the Anywhere Door, the bowling
        ball follows him home through the door and another robot piece falls
        into his backyard.</image:caption
