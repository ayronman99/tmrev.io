        >After years working as a border patrolman, José has developed a salty
        crust of cynicism about his work, which places him in a position to
        decide the fates of many. José's weary attitude is put to the test when
        he encounters Nathalie, a German tourist assisting a boatload of
        refugees she discovered landing on the Canary shores. One of those
        people, a Congolese man named Zola, is placed in an internment camp.
        Much to the objections of her husband Paul, Nathalie tries to help him
        escape. Yet Zola and his son Mamadou eventually find themselves in yet
        another precarious situation, in which they are dependent on nefarious
        smugglers.</image:caption
