        >Due to climate change a new race of flesh eating predators arise, who
        invade and eat everything living on earth. In a residential
        neighbourhood in a Danish suburb nightmare like scenes are being
        experienced first hand through the eyes of two teenage brothers, who
        can't stand each other, but are now suddenly forced to barricade
        themselves in the basement together, to avoid getting eaten. From one
        day to another, without parents and without electricity, food, water and
        contact to other people, the brothers have to learn to live together in
        their vital protection bunker, while monsters move past the basement
        windows and heavy, sharp claws can be heard moving around upstairs on
        the wooden floors.</image:caption
