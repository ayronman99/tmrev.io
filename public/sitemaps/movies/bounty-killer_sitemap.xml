        >It’s been 20 years since the corporations took over the world’s
        governments. Their thirst for power and profits led to the Corporate
        Wars, a fierce global battle that laid waste to society as we know it.
        Born from the ash, the Council of Nine rose as a new law and order for
        this dark age. To avenge the corporations’ reckless destruction, the
        Council issues death warrants for all white collar criminals. Their
        hunters—the bounty killer. From amateur savage to graceful assassin, the
        bounty killers now compete for body count, fame and a fat stack of cash.
        They’re ending the plague of corporate greed and providing the survivors
        of the apocalypse with retribution. These are the new heroes. This is
        the age of the BOUNTY KILLER.</image:caption
