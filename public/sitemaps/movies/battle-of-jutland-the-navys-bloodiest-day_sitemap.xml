        >Documentary about the Battle of Jutland, a naval battle during World
        War I between the British and German fleets, which took place on 31 May
        and 1 June 1916 in the North Sea, off the west coast of Denmark. It
        re-creates the events of the battle and examines why the number of
        British warships that sank was so much higher than the number of German
        ships that were lost. Shown to commemorate the 100-year anniversary of
        the battle.</image:caption
