        >After losing their mother, Mía and Moi take refuge in a ramshackle
        family home, in the countryside, in the middle of nowhere. With them,
        Biel, Moi’s boyfriend. Together the three of them try to rest and heal
        the wounds. Especially in the case of Moi, who is recovering from a
        severe nervous breakdown. These are days of recovering family memories,
        some of them painful, of meeting again, of living without haste. The
        arrival of Mikel, Mía’s boyfriend, will alter the coexistence and
        disturb each of the inhabitants of the house in different ways. The
        tension grows until it explodes in an act of violence with irreversible
        consequences.</image:caption
