        >In the 1930s, a social set known to the press – who follow their every
        move – as the “Bright Young Things” are Adam and his friends who are
        eccentric, wild and entirely shocking to the older generation. Amidst
        the madness, Adam, who is well connected but totally broke, is
        desperately trying to get enough money to marry the beautiful Nina.
        While his attempts to raise cash are constantly thwarted, their friends
        seem to self-destruct, one-by-one, in an endless search for newer and
        faster sensations. Finally, when world events out of their control come
        crashing around them, they are forced to reassess their lives and what
        they value most.</image:caption
