        >In the 1970s, New Zealand artist Allie Eagle identified herself as a
        lesbian separatist and radical feminist. Her often uncompromising work
        included pro-abortion painting This Woman Died I Care, which was
        inspired by a photograph of a woman who died from an illegal abortion.
        In the 1980s, Eagle became a christian. Made in 2004, Briar March's
        first, feature-length documentary sees Eagle reflecting on her past with
        a more moderate outlook â€” she now has mixed feelings about her earlier
        stance on abortion.</image:caption
