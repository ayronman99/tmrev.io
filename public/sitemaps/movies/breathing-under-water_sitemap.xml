        >What stops two people from being together? A third one. What stops one
        person from fighting for another? Nothing. Pedro lives in the suburbs,
        where he works with his father in a garage. Everyday he takes the bus
        downtown where he goes to school and meets his friends. It's summertime
        and they all go down to the river where they spend their free time or
        even their school time. Among joints, motorbike riding and swimming,
        everything seems to go well with this group of friends, until the moment
        when Pedro and his best friend find out that both of them like the same
        girl. Pedro finds himself inside a downward spiral, where everything
        around him seems to fall apart. Like a magnet attracts the iron, Pedro
        seems to attract problems, from the school until his relationship with
        his parents. This is the story of Pedro, who by having his head being
        pushed down so much learned how to breathe under water.</image:caption
