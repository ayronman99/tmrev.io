        >It’s Christmas Day on a remote human colony and the Doctor is hiding
        from Christmas Carols and Comedy Antlers. But when a crashed spaceship
        calls upon the Doctor for help, he finds himself recruited into River
        Song’s squad and hurled into a fast and frantic chase across the galaxy.
        King Hydroflax is furious, and his giant Robot bodyguard is
        out-of-control and coming for them all! Will Nardole survive? And when
        will River Song work out who the Doctor is? All will be revealed on a
        starliner full of galactic super-villains and a destination the Doctor
        has been avoiding for a very long time.</image:caption
