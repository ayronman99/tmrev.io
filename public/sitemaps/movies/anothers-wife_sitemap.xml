        >Rich Do-won lives off the libido of a sexual plaything girl named Yoo
        Min-hee. One day, his elder brother, Dae-ho, is kicked out of the
        company after his brother's business went bankrupt and he was raising
        money here and there. Dae-ho visits his wife Seong-ah and borrows money
        from Do-won. But he can't even pay back the interest and ends up being a
        fugitive, and Do-won takes advantage of this opportunity to approach
        Dae-ho's wife. After such a hard time, Dae-ho and Seong-ah run away.
        However, Dae-ho dies after being caught by Do-won, who was waiting in
        advance, and takes the baby home alone. As time goes by, Seong-ah's body
        heats up and wants an active relationship, and then Do-won's
        unconventional demands increase. And then one day, her husband who she
        thought was dead, came to see her.</image:caption
