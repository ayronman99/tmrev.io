        >Based on footage shot in the early seventies and lost for more than
        thirty years, we see and hear the young Bob Marley before he was famous.
        The film shows us the Wailers' first rehearsal, when the idea of a
        Jamaican supergroup was still just a dream. Sit in as the albums of Bob
        Marley and the Wailers brought reggae music and Rasta consciousness to
        the world, starting a revolution that would change rock music and
        contemporary culture.</image:caption
