        >The city is gasping for air in the scorching summer heat; everyone is
        under suspicion; a persistent detective superintendent is burrowing for
        the truth. A fiercely penetrating drama about a mother's love for her
        autistic adult son, who is suspected of murdering a local girl. The
        mother knows her son could have committed the murder, but she conceals
        her knowledge, and gradually becomes entangled in a thicket of lies. How
        far is she prepared to go to protect her son who is helpless in so many
        ways? Does she have it within her to give up the only person she
        loves?</image:caption
