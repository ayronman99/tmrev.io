        >A serial killer terrorizes the horror-stricken town of Canyon City.
        Plagued by a 10-year-old tale of the mysterious murder of Devon
        Anderson, this community still harbors curiosity when the current
        victims - and the evidence surrounding their murders - appear to be very
        similar to what happened to Devon and the parents accused of killing
        him. Did Devon die? Convinced Devon is alive - and the killer - a group
        of teens set off to find and stop him from murdering again. Staying one
        step ahead of the authorities, they find out the killer is too smart and
        too strong running is not an option. They must fight to escape the
        killer's wrath and get one step closer to answering the legend and
        mystery that surrounds that fateful night.</image:caption
