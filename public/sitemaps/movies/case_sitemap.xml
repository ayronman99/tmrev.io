        >The Hell Gang, an exclusive group of friends, promise a schoolmate that
        he can join their gang if he can just make it to the porch of a
        legendary mansion that has a dark and sinister past. Others have tried
        but none have made it within sight of the mansion before fleeing back in
        terror. Eddie, who is rigged with a camera to prove he did it, does not
        return at all! Five members of the gang must now go in to find him. They
        set off, confident that Eddie is trying to prank them. But what they
        find in the old mansion is even more terrifying than the campfire
        stories and legends of the murdered children that once lived
        there.</image:caption
