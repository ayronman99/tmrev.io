        >Kale is a 17-year-old placed under house arrest after punching his
        teacher. He is confined to his house, and decides to use his free time
        spying on his neighbors. Things start to get weird when guests enter the
        Turner's house and don't come back out. Kale and his friends, Ronnie and
        Ashley, start to grow more and more interested in what is actually
        happening within the house of Robert Turner.</image:caption
