        >Lydia, a successful professional organizer, is constantly trying to
        grow her business, but even her ambition takes a back seat to love when
        she meets Robert, a frazzled widower with two young children. A toy
        inventor, Robert is asked to present his new Christmas toy line to a
        superstore. His challenge is he only has 12 days to get his life and his
        business in order. Talk about a Christmas rush! Lydia shows Robert that
        this task goes way deeper than messy junk drawers and encompasses every
        aspect of his life. While sheâ€™s intent on helping him straighten out
        details he had long ignored, Robert teaches the buttoned-up Lydia that
        messiness can be a delightful part of life.</image:caption
