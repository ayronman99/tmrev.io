        >The story of soldier and poet Siegfried Sassoon (1886â€“1967), who was
        decorated for bravery on the Western Front, and is best remembered for
        his angry and compassionate poems about the First World War, which
        brought him public and critical acclaim. Avoiding the sentimentality and
        jingoism of many war poets, Sassoon wrote of the horror and brutality of
        trench warfare and contemptuously satirised generals, politicians, and
        churchmen for their incompetence and blind support of the
        war.</image:caption
