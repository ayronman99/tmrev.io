        >The film director, Carol Reed, is the subject of this documentary
        short. The illegitimate son of the famous stage actor, 'Sir Herbert
        Beerbohm Tree' , Reed was brilliant with actors, especially child
        actors, making him the perfect person to bring Oliver! to the screen.
        Reed is best known for three films he made in the late 1940s, and the
        documentary offers generous clips from Odd Man Out, The Fallen Idol, and
        the most famous of all, The Third Man. The film director, John Boorman,
        the assistant director, Guy Hamilton, the actors, Ron Moody and Bryan
        Forbes and the cinematographer, Oswald Morris, are among the
        interviewees.</image:caption
