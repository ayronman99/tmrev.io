        >"A Film About Coffee" is a love letter to, and meditation on, specialty
        coffee. It examines what it takes, and what it means, for coffee to be
        defined as "specialty." The film whisks audiences on a trip around the
        world, from farms in Honduras and Rwanda to coffee shops in Tokyo,
        Portland, Seattle, San Francisco and New York. Through the eyes and
        experiences of farmers and baristas, the film offers a unique overview
        of all the elements-the processes, preferences and preparations;
        traditions old and new-that come together to create the best cups. This
        is a film that bridges gaps both intellectual and geographical, evoking
        flavor and pleasure, and providing both as well.</image:caption
