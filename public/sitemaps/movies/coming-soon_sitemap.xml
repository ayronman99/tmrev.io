        give up illegal works when his wife wanted to get divorce. To win his
        family back, he and his old-fashioned crew decided to make a movie
        called "Summit - The End Of Evil" which is a fantastic science fiction
        movie and couldn't be shot since 1977. A funny, entertaining and
        emotional journey awaits him who waded into this adventure with his
