        >Nguyen was reported for a car theft and ended up being shot nine times
        by police officer Chen Chung-wen. Nguyen bled to death on the way to the
        hospital. The public supported Chen's use of firearms against the
        runaway migrant who resisted arrest. Were the nine shots the only cause
        of Nguyen's death? When the perpetrator isn't necessarily the true
        perpetrator, is the imperfect victim the one to blame?</image:caption
