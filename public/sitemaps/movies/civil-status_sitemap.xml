        >A brilliant observational documentary filmed at the Civil Registry
        office in St. Petersburg, where people come to have births, marriages,
        divorces and deaths registered. 'It’s like a theatre here', one says in
        the beginning of the film, and it indeed is, the Theater of Life. The
        young women working in the office have a job that shifts from being
        verbally attacked and called idiots, to situations where they are
        subject to flirt, or where they master the happy ceremony of marriage.
        Faces, joy, sorrow, fun, despair... It’s all very well composed,
        rhythmical, with atmosphere conveyed, and lives up to what a documentary
        should be: multilayered and universal. And about Life.</image:caption
