        >Beat Down is an irreverent comedy about wrestling, family and following
        your dreams no matter how painful that can sometimes be. Fran Whiteway
        (Marthe Bernard, Republic of Doyle) is eighteen and a real firecracker.
        More than anything, Fran dreams of becoming a professional wrestler. Her
        single-father Whitey (Robb Wells, Trailer Park Boys) is a former-pro,
        aka White Lightning, with broken dreams of his own and is dead set
        against Fran wrestling. Fran is determined though and when Whitey's old
        rival Dark Thunder (Tony Nappo, Saw II) comes to town, she runs away to
        join his tour. Whitey is devastated and while he tries to get his
        daughter back, Fran learns the ropes of the wrestling game and of life
        itself.</image:caption
