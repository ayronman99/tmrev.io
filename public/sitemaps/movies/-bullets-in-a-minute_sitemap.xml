        >The world watched in horror as the NYPD was put on trial for the
        shooting of Sean Bell and Amadou Diallo. The chants of "no justice," "no
        peace" were heard around the world, but in the end was justice served?
        In this sequel to IF I DIE TONIGHT, the story continues and follows the
        next seven years of this case of police brutality. It presents both
        sides in an effort to find the truth after the culminating trials. This
        riveting documentary continues to ask the question, "how far has our
        country actually come?" Features Al Sharpen, Rudy Giuliani, and Eliot
        Spitzer.</image:caption
