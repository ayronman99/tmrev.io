        >The movie begins with the Jönsson gang making a minor burglary. It goes
        wrong and the gang leader, Sickan, gets caught. After he has spent 10
        months in jail, Vanheden and Rocky come to welcome him when he's
        released. But he doesn't take notice of them, and he's picked up by the
        mysterious banker Wall-Enberg Jr. instead. He wants Sickan to perform a
        burglary in Switzerland, in order to retrieve the famous Bedford
        Diamonds. Sickan does this but is fooled by Wall-Enberg and nearly gets
        caught. When he returns to Sweden and re-unites with his old gang
        members, he's set on revenge, both physically and
        psychologically...</image:caption
