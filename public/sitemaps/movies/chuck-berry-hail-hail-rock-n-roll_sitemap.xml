        >St. Louis, 1986. For Chuck Berry's 60th, Keith Richards assembles a
        pickup band of Robert Cray, Joey Spampinato, Eric Clapton, himself and
        long-time Berry pianist, Johnnie Johnson. Joined on stage by Etta James,
        Linda Ronstadt and Julian Lennon, Berry performs his classic rock songs.
        His abilities as a composer, lyricist, singer, musician and entertainer
        are on display and, in behind-the-scenes interviews, are discussed by Bo
        Diddley, Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis, Bruce Springstein, the Everly
        Brothers, Roy Orbison and others. There's even a rarity for Berryâ€”a
        rehearsal. Archival footage from the early 1950s and a duet with John
        Lennon round out this portrait of a master.</image:caption
