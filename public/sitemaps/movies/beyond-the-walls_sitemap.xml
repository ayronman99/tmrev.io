        >Paulo, a young pianist, meets Ilir, a double-bass player originally
        from Albania. It's love at first sight. Confronted by Anka, Paulo finds
        himself out on the street. Despite Ilir's misgivings, Paulo moves in
        with him. One day, when Paulo promises that he will love Ilir for the
        rest of his life, Ilir leaves the city and doesn't return. A few days
        later, Paulo finds out that Ilir is in jail, and the two lovers embark
