        >Who loves whom in Così fan tutte, Mozart’s and Da Ponte’s cruelly comic
        reflection on desire, fidelity and betrayal? Or have the confusions to
        which the main characters subject one another ensured that in spite of
        the heartfelt love duets and superficially fleetfooted comedy nothing
        will work any longer and that a sense of emotional erosion has replaced
        true feelings? Così fan tutte is a timeless work full of questions that
        affect us all. The Academy Award-winning director Michael Haneke once
        said that he was merely being precise and did not want to distort
        reality. In only his second opera production after Don Giovanni in 2006,
        he presents what ARTE described as a “disillusioned vision of love in an
        ice-cold, realistic interpretation”.</image:caption
