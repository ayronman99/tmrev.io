        >Few bands are more closely associated with Montreux than Deep Purple
        and there was simply no other contender when it came to choosing the act
        to headline the closing night of the 40th Montreux Festival in 2006. The
        band duly delivered one of their finest live performances, sprinkling
        songs from their latest album "Rapture Of The Deep" through a set chock
        full of their classic tracks. There was even a brand new song "Too Much
        Fun" written especially for the occasion and, of course, a show-stopping
        performance of "Smoke On The Water".</image:caption
