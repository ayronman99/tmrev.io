        >Abi Titmus was the girlfriend of television presenter John Leslie when
        he was accused of rape and torn to shreds by the tabloids. She stood by
        him in the court case until he was found innocent and then she decided
        to "make something good of this situation" and left her £16k pa nursing
        job and hired a publicity agent. This got her some nice work (Richard &
        Judy for one) and the money was coming in nicely - until a tabloid broke
        a "story" about her having group sex with Leslie and some strangers. She
        denies it at first but then milks it by getting £50k for a "confession"
        to a Sunday paper - a confession she says the papers twisted. However,
        her denials were for naught when a sex tape showing the whole thing hit
        the internet. However, getting the profits from that film when it was
        released on dvd, Abi also found herself in demand from the tabloids and
        men's magazine. Owning half the rights to the photographs is a nice
        earner for her, along with the publicity do's, the
        calendars</image:caption
