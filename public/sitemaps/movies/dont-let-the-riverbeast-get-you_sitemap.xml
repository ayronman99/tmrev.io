        >In this campy throwback to 1950s monster films, a vicious monster, the
        Riverbeast, has arisen from its watery lair to terrorize a peaceful New
        England town. Local tutor Neil Stuart has seen the beast before, but
        nobody believed his story, making him the town laughingstock. Neil sets
        out to not only prove that the Riverbeast exists, but also, with the
        help of his beautiful pupil, scrappy tutor buddies, and a former
        professional athlete, to vanquish the aquatic menace!</image:caption
