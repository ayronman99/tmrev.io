        >When she was a middle school student, Futaba Yoshioka liked Kou Tanaka
        who was unlike the other boys and quite gentle. Kou Tanaka then moved
        away and they lost contact. At the end of Futaba Yoshioka's first year
        as a high school student she meets Kou Tanaka again. Kou Tanakaâ€™s name
        has changed to Kou Mabuchi and his personality seems different from his
        middle school days.</image:caption
