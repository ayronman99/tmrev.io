        >BÃªte Noire (French for "black beast" meaning pet peeve) is the seventh
        solo studio album by Bryan Ferry, the former lead vocalist for Roxy
        Music. The album was released in November 1987 on Virgin Records in the
        United Kingdom and E.G. in the United States, two years after Ferry's
        successful album, Boys and Girls. This was Ferry's second solo album
        since the second demise of Roxy Music in 1983, four years earlier. The
        album was a commercial and critical success, peaking at No. 9 in the
        UK.</image:caption
