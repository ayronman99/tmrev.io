        >Sara has been alone all her life. She’s 22, has a baby, and wants to
        form a normal family with her young brother and the father of her child.
        Her own father, Manuel, decides to come back into their lives after
        years of absence and his release from prison. Sara knows he’s the main
        obstacle to her plans and she makes a difficult decision: to distance
        him from herself and her brother.</image:caption
