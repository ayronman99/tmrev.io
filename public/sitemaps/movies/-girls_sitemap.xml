        >For two years, filmmaker Maria Finitzo followed five strong young women
        between the ages of 13 and 17. Unlike the myriad reports, books and
        "specials" that focus on young women as passive and powerless, 5 Girls
        explores the ways these girls discover the resources necessary to
        successfully navigate the rocky waters of adolescence. It focuses on the
        positive ways girls learn to adapt to challenge in their lives by
        understanding and exercising choices, by believing in their strength
        when others do not and by resisting powerful cultural messages, which
        urge them to be silent.</image:caption
