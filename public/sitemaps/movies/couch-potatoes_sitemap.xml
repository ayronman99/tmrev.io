        >Giorgio and Tito, father and son. A successful journalist and a lazy
        teenager apparently impossible to understand. Giorgio's dream is to take
        Tito to the Nasca Hill in Liguria, but Tito prefers to spend his entire
        day with his group of friends, eating, talking about nothing and playing
        video games. Until one day when he suddenly informs his father that he
        would join him in this trip. After a series of accidents and
        misunderstandings, at the end, somehow father and son will find the way
        to communicate â€¦ or at least they will try.</image:caption
