        >There is no indication that this typical online flirtation between two
        strangers would turn into a case of shocking international intrigue. For
        months, Sandra in Montreal and Amina, a Syrian-American, bond
        romantically and intellectually. Encouraged by Sandra, Amina launches a
        blog called "A Gay Girl in Damascus," representing a marginalized voice
        in the Middle East on politics, religion, and sexuality. Rapidly
        garnering worldwide attention, Amina becomes something of a star
        blogger. But when Syria enters the Arab uprising of 2011, Sandra
        receives word that Amina has been kidnapped, and soon the search for
        Amina becomes a global concern and an even larger mystery to
        solve.</image:caption
