        >“My new feature length documentary Breadcrumb Trail is about Slint and
        the Louisville music culture they emerged from. It includes footage
        going back to the early 1990s that I shot when repeatedly driving up
        from Athens, GA to Louisville to try to chase rumors of what they guys
        were up to. Over the years I tracked down more stories about them, then
        began filming interviews with each of the band members and their
        contemporaries. We also unearthed some unseen/uncirculated footage from
        their few live performances as well as the writing and arranging of
        Spiderland.”</image:caption
