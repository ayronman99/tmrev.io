        >This American Experience tells Whitman's life story, from his
        working-class childhood in Long Island, to his years as a newspaper
        reporter in Brooklyn when he struggled to support his impoverished
        family, then to his reckless pursuit of the attention and affection he
        craved for his work, to his death in 1892.</image:caption
