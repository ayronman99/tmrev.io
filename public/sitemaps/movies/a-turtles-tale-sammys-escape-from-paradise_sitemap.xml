        >Sammy and Ray, leatherback turtles and friends forever, are enjoying an
        atoll's water and sand, shepherding new hatchlings Ricky and Ella out to
        sea. Suddenly, a poacher swoops in and ships them off to be part of a
        spectacular aquarium show for tourists in Dubai. The kingpin of the
        place, Big D the seahorse, enlists them in his plans for a great escape.
        But with their new friends Jimbo the bug-eyed blob fish and Lulu the
        snippy lobster, Annabel the sweet Octopus, and a whole family of
        penguins, Sammy and Ray hatch breakout plans of their own. That is when
        little Ricky and Ella arrive, determined to break in to rescue them.
        After a series of thrilling adventures and narrow escapes, our heroes
        head south to meet up with Shelly, Sammy's first and only
        love.</image:caption
