        >Along the banks of the Côa river in Portugal lies an archaeological
        treasure: 1,000 prehistoric engravings out in open air. When they were
        discovered in the 90’s, they immediately caused a sensation among
        historians and archaeologists. They are scattered over a very large area
        that has not changed much in the past 30,000 years. Along the riverbed,
        on granite and schist plaques, men engraved signs that special weather
        and geological conditions have preserved for thousands of years. Today
        the Côa Valley is part of Unesco’s World Heritage.</image:caption
