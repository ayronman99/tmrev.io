        >Rio de Janeiro. September, 2008. Three men stalk the gloomy back-alleys
        of the city's notorious slums. Spiderman, a 28-year-old drug lord,
        embarks on a routine patrol through the shadowy streets of Cor√©ia, the
        sprawling slum he controls. Inspector Leonardo Torres, a muscle-bound
        operative from Rio's drug squad, inches through the alleys of another
        shantytown, shots ringing out around him. And Pastor Dione, an
        evangelical preacher intent on ending Rio's drug conflict, trawls the
        slums for lost souls. With unprecedented access to some of Rio's most
        wanted men, Dancing with the Devil in the City of God tells the story of
        Rio's drug war through the eyes of three men locked into one of the
        bloodiest urban conflicts on earth. Written by Jon Blair and Tom
        Phillips</image:caption
