        >1000 Smiles Per Hour. 1000 Smiles on a stage in front of an audience
        that uses you as a mirror, as a chance to look at themselves, into
        themselves. Into their deepest desires and fears. Into their humanity.
        But what about yourself? Who are you? You walk the streets towards a
        destination we do not know. You meet a woman whose relationship to you
        is unclear. You remain a ghost, who needs to wash off make-up, a mask, a
        second personality which you squeeze yourself into for a couple of hours
        every day. You're the one who smiles for us, who shows us who we are and
        who disappears in the shadow of ourselves.</image:caption
