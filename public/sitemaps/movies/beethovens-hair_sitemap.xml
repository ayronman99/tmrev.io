        >Beethoven's Hair traces the unlikely journey of a lock of hair cut from
        Beethoven's corpse and unravels the mystery of his tortured life and
        death. The film begins in modern times, when a pair of Beethoven
        enthusiasts purchase the hair at a Sotheby's auction. The story then
        looks at the lock's previous owners and culminates in the science that
        reveals Beethoven's "medical secret". Set to a lush score of some of
        Beethoven's most glorious music, the film explores the world of forensic
        testing in sharp relief against the romance of 19th-century Vienna and
        the horrors of 20th-century Nazi Germany.</image:caption
