        >Vincent and Olivier have an intense, rocky relationship: Vincent evades
        tenderness, just as he does desire, forcing the couple to hunt for a
        third partner to participate in their sexual games. Olivier has a
        background in the theater. He believes in, but is preoccupied by their
        relationship; he wants to free Vincent from the ghosts haunting him. But
        Vincent is locked into the past. His father, a pilot, was killed in a
        plane accident. Vincent’s job is a strange, uncommon one that plunges
        him deep into contemplation from which no one can make him budge: he
        deciphers plane disaster recordings. Vincent’s unconscious repression is
        so powerful that he hasn’t even recognized the link between his father’s
        death and his work. It will take the stormy encounter with Olivier for
        Vincent to obtain his ‘black box.’ Indeed, the two young men come to
        life through their connection with each other, a connection which
        shatters the framework of typical love stories.</image:caption
