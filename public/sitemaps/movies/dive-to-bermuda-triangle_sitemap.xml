        >There is a mystery there and the answer lies somewhere between Bermuda,
        Puerto Rico and Miami. Hundreds of boats and planes have disappeared in
        the ocean with little or no trace at all. Most of these cases can be
        explained quite easily by human error or bad weather. But there are some
        that defy all explanation. Theories abound on these causes: Aliens,
        massive gas eruptions and freak waves. The documentary reveals that the
        boats and planes face a real danger in a triangle, but the true threat
        is often as strange as the wildest theory.</image:caption
