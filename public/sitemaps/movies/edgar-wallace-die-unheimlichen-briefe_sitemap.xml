        >Strange, rhymed advertisements in the TIMES unsettle three London
        gangsters - and rightly so, because soon the first of them are killed.
        The mysterious killer also catches a shady lawyer. Higgins and Lane find
        out that the key to the crimes is an unsolved diamond heist from jeweler
        Bolden. It looks like those involved are fighting over the loot.
        Eventually, it turns out that the "robbery" was actually a set-up
        insurance scam that Bolden was personally behind and that killed his
        employee. Shortly before the last survivor is sent to the afterlife,
        Higgins and Lane are able to confront the "invisible"
        murderer.</image:caption
