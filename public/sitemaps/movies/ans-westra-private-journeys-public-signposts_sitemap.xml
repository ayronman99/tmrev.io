        >Private Journeys / Public Signposts turns the camera on photographer
        Ans Westra. Dutch emigree Westra has captured iconic images of New
        Zealanders since the late 1950s, expressively observing Aotearoa
        societal changes, particularly MƒÅori urban drift. This film explores her
        remarkable life and work, and includes commentary from family and
        friends, fellow photographers, and colleagues, as well as discussion of
        the Washday at the Pa controversy. Luit Bieringa, curator of Westra's
        retrospective photo exhibition, directed the film, his first. -
