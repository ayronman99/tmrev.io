        >Turkish director Hasan Karacadag is something of an unusual case. In a
        nation that appears uncertain how to feel about its own history with
        exploitation film and generally reluctant to embrace genre film - though
        there are obvious exceptions - Karacadag has jumped headlong into the
        horror pool. The director first came to attention with the J-horror
        influenced D@BB, a surprise hit in Turkey that allowed Karacadag to move
        on to the more visually ambitious - and effects heavy - effort, Semum.
        Both film showcased Karacadag's growing ability to shock and terrify his
        audiences by taking the rich folklore of his country and pushing it to
        its dark extremes. And he's at it again with D@BB: Bir Cin Vakasi. The
        sequel to his original hit, this latest efforts puts away the Japanese
        influence in favor of a more Paranormal vibe, but the underlying
        mythology remains purely regional with the story following a Turkish
        family whose home is possessed by angry jinns</image:caption
