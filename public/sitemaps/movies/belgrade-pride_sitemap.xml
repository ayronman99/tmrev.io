        >In June 2001 Belgrade lesbians, gay men, bisexuals and trans people
        organized a Pride event in celebration of the new era of democracy and
        tolerance that was believed to have come to Serbia. About 40 people came
        to celebrate. Several thousand counter-demonstrators organized, showed
        up and brutally beat them. This crucial documentary serves as a reminder
        that LGBT existance is not safe and sound, and human rights should never
        be taken for granted.</image:caption
