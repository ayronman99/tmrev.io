        >The Mesopotamian Marshes, at the delta of the Euphrates and Tigris
        rivers, in the south of Iraq. This is where Mastour and Zahra grow up.
        Shortly after their marriage, Mastour and Zahra are forced to separate
        when the Gulf War breaks out. On the battlefield, Mastour befriends
        Riad, a young soldier from Baghdad. Mortally wounded, Mastour makes Riad
        promise to protect Zahra when the war is over. When Riad arrives in the
        village, he falls deeply in love with Zahra. But unable to bear the loss
        of her husband, Zahra shuts herself off. In this completely foreign
        environment that is hostile to this newcomer, and as a new conflict is
        on the verge of inflaming the whole area, Riad will do the impossible to
        find his place.</image:caption
