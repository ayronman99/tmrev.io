        >In Korea Town Los Angeles, a young man, Kengo, believes he's the son of
        God - that's what his mother told him since he was a young boy. He
        spends his days working his dead-end job and figuring out his complex
        feelings for his girlfriend until, one day, he sees a one-eared man who
        could be his father and decides to follow him around Los
        Angeles.</image:caption
