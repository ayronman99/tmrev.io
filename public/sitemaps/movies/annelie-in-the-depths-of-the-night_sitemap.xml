        >A young girl called Annetje Lie is staying with her grandmother for an
        undisclosed period after her father unceremoniously dropped her off and
        left. At night, Annetje disappears into a dream world in which her
        friend the Moon transports her back to her elderly home. There she gets
        into all sorts of nightmarish adventures with the King of Mice and the
        mysterious Heintje Vaar. Meanwhile, her grandmother is beginning to
        suspect Annetje might be seriously ill.</image:caption
