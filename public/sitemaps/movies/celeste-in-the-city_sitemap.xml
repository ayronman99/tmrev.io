        >Small town girl Celeste Blodgett moves from Bangor, Maine to Manhattan
        when she gets a job with the New York Examiner, but hears there it's
        only fact checking, with little prospects for real journalism. Her
        welcoming young flat neighbor Kyle Halley in an interior designer, who
        helps her to give her apartment a make-over. At a party she learns her
        cousin is gay and goes by the new name Dana Harrison; he promises to
        teach her the city way with a fashionable image transformation, which
        succeeds with the help of various gay friends. Now she's ready for
        social life, hoping to impress her boss, reputedly womanizing magazine
        section editor Mitch Tanzer. He accepts to read her work, but says he
        can't use it because it's unethical given their personal relationship-
        then she finds reality is different.</image:caption
