        >Counting for Thunder is inspired by the three years when Phillip Irwin
        Cooper, unlucky in work, money and love, went home to the Gulf Coast of
        Alabama to help out with a family crisis. Working through his past with
        his complicated family, some old high school chums, and the desperate
        and hilarious southern characters who grace his hometown, Phillip
        ultimately finds his own voice as his mother is regaining hers for
        possibly the last time.</image:caption
