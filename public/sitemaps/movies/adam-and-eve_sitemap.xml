        >Easy-going, gentle college-boy Adam Baker enjoys frat-life, however
        disgusting the frat-house gets because of his sloppy house-mates
        Freddie, Ferguson and Munch. Then Adam meets Eve, starts falling in
        love, but gets jealous of frat-brother Billy, who 'bumps' almost
        constantly without seeking love, while Eve guards her campus-unique
        virginity. As even his thrice-divorced dad, an MD, urges Adam to get
        laid rather then loved, his patience runs out against healthy
        hormones</image:caption
