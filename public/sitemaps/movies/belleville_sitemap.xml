        >Reclusive farmer Willie has been depressed since the death of his wife
        Jana ten years ago. His only friend is a neighbor named Arlene who also
        likes to wallow in misery. Willie's life changes when a stranger from
        another world named Neila shows up on his farm. Over the course of a
        week, Neila has a profound impact on Willie -- and the entire community
        of Southern Illinois.</image:caption
