        >This documentary spans the life and career of Spanish soprano
        Montserrat Caballé, one of the very best ever - a legend, arguably the
        "queen" of all divas still singing. In locations throughout the world
        where Ms. Caballé sang, we hear interviews with Ms. Caballé, her family,
        and by opera and music giants like Claudio Abbado, José Carreras,
        Giuseppe Di Stefano, Plácido Domingo, Renée Fleming, Dame Joan
        Sutherland, and Zubin Mehta, also appearing often in clips showing joint
        collaborations. Of these, the film includes passages from Caballé's most
        acclaimed roles such as "Norma"', "Tosca" , "Turandot" and her earliest
        recorded live performance (1966) as "Anne Boleyn," in addition to
        poignant and powerful live concert duets with fellow Spaniards Plácido
        Domingo, Juan Pons, and José Carreras.</image:caption
