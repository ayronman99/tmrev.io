        >Lowly theme park mechanic Sam dreams about his childhood sweetheart
        Sue. With the mistaken belief that only a bling ring can win the girl of
        his dreams, Sam plans the most perfect night to propose to his one true
        love. But when super villain Oscar shows up with his own evil ring that
        could destroy the city, Sam’s plans are thrown into utter disarray.
        Mistaking each other’s rings for their own, Sam teams up with his robot
        super heroes to track down his engagement ring and save the city…
        learning that it’s not about the size of the bling, but the size of your
        heart.</image:caption
