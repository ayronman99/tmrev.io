        >Kyle is loyal to his wife, his best mate and his boss in the Ulster
        Defence Union – and they love him as a husband, a brother and a son –
        but, with changing times and the emerging peace process, Kyle finds
        himself lost in the shadows of transition, uncertainty, and betrayal. In
        a world turned upside down, peace and brutality walk side-by-side, while
        love and loyalty are sacrificed to the new order. "As the Beast Sleeps"
        is set in Belfast's Protestant Rathcoole housing estate and explores
        with an up-to-the-minute urgency, the fragmentation within an extended
        family of loyalists in the context of the current
        cease-fire.</image:caption
