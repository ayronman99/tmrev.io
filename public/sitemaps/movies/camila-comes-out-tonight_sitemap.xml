        >When her grandmother becomes seriously ill, Camila is forced to move to
        Buenos Aires, leaving behind a liberal public high school for a
        scholastic, traditional private institution. Suddenly a senior without
        any friends, and with her single mother caught up in family affairs;
        Camila's fierce yet immature temperament is put to the test as she deals
        with the jarring change of scenery, and the alluring set of
        possibilities and experiences that lie in wait in the big
        city.</image:caption
