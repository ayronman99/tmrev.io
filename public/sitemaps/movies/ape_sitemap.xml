        >Trevor Newandyke is a struggling comedian. Not only does he bomb on
        stage, but he bombs in everyday life. He’s fed up with all the jerks who
        push him around. All he wants is a break, and for someone to get him.
        Instead of taking a breath and getting himself together or taking his
        anger to the stage, he turns to the loud din of his headphones and the
        crackling glow of fire to ease his mind. He’s not only a lousy comic,
        but a pyromaniac, as well.</image:caption
