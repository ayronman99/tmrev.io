        >Nuno, a boy of nine, runs away from home on the night of the 24th of
        April 1974. He hides in a mysterious building that is being abandoned in
        great haste. People are running down the stairs, cars are leaving,
        finally Nuno and a dog are the only ones left. They become friends and
        fall asleep together. In the morning they wake up with screams from the
        street. Nuno thinks that it is his mother calling for him and runs to
        the window. The street its full of people, tanks and soldiers. It’s the
        25th of April. And Nuno believes that it was his mother who made the
        revolution just to find him.</image:caption
