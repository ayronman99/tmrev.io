        >After a shooting assignment, Henrique is mugged by two armed
        motor-bikers who steal his camera and speed off. Seconds later, he
        watches both get hit by a pickup truck driven by a self-appointed
        avenger, someone weary of feeling defenseless against the urban
        violence, and who decided to take action. Henrique recovers his stolen
        equipment and leaves, feeling avenged. But he goes back to find the
        memory card, with the photos, lost during the crash. From that moment,
        he is trapped in a situation where he is now the criminal for failing to
        rescue a victim, who had been his aggressor. Going from the murder scene
        to the police station, and then to the emergency ward of the public
        hospital, he attempts to clear himself.</image:caption
