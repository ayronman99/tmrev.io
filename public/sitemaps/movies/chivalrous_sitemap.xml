        >During the Northern Song Dynasty, the valuable Xuanwu Order was lost to
        the rivers and lakes, and the four martial arts families fought against
        each other. Leng Xuanfeng trapped Nangong Yu and his men in the dense
        forest of Wolong Valley. At the same time, Princess Yongning, a
        descendant of the Zhou Dynasty, was captured by the young master of the
        Green Dragon Gate, Xu Lingyun, and Nangong Yu was so furious that he
        sent a letter to Master Jing Yuan of the Heavenly Mountains and Snowy
        Range. Mok Siu Ho obeys his master's order and returns to the mountain,
        resolving the feuds and disputes between the four families and restoring
        the peace of the rivers and lakes. Translated with
