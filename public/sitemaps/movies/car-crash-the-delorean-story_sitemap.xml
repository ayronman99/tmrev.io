        >Former General Motors high-flyer John DeLorean had a plan to build a
        stylish European sports car, at a price that would make it attractive to
        the American market. The site he chose for his state-of-the-art factory
        was on the outskirts of Belfast, a city best-known for sectarian
        violence and high levels of unemployment. The unexpected marriage of
        high-tech glamour with the gritty reality of 1970s Northern Ireland
        captured the public's imagination but this early optimism would end in
        failure. Although the cars looked great, the windows leaked and the
        engines seized; as his financial problems mounted the maverick DeLorean
        faced charges of drugs trafficking. Adrian Dunbar narrates the
        story.</image:caption
