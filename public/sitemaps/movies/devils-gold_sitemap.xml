        >Devil Gold is director Jos√© Novoa's third collaboration with producer
        Elia Schneider, and like the previous two films, Huelepega (or Glue
        Sniffer, which Schneider directed in 2000) and Sicario (1994), the film
        is a thriller-melodrama that focuses on a real-life problem plaguing
        Venezuela, with an emphasis on how the conditions affect children. Thus,
        after a few titles explaining the impact that gold mining has had on the
        country's Amazon region, along with helicopter footage (later to be
        blended into the narrative) of the ecologically devastated area, the
        film settles in on the lawless shanty town of Payapal for its narrative.
        Gallego (Armando Gota) runs the mine, exploiting his cheap labor force.
        Aroldo (Pedro Lander) breaks into Gallego's safe and steals his gold,
        along with a good deal of gold that Gallego was holding for his workers.
        Aroldo involves the unwitting Carmen (Jenny Noguera) in the robbery,
        and, when they are discovered, he shoots and kills Gallego's young
        son.</image:caption
