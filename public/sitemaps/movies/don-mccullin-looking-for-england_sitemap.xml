        >Travelogue that follows photographer Don McCullin, now 83, documenting
        his country from inner cities to seaside towns, on a journey in search
        of his own nation. Sixty years after starting out as a photographer,
        McCullin returns to his old haunts in the East End of London, Bradford,
        Consett, Eastbourne and Scarborough. Along the way he encounters an
        array of English characters at the Glyndebourne Festival and Goodwood
        Revival and photographs a hunt and a group of saboteurs aiming to
        disrupt them. McCullinâ€™s journey is punctuated by scenes in his
        darkroom, a place he is allowing cameras into for the first
        time.</image:caption
