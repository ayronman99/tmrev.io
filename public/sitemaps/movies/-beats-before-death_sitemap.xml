        >Nobody knows what death is, as nobody has survived long enough to talk
        about it. But maybe death is not the end of life after all. 'When an old
        person dies, a baby is born', as one of the old ladies says without a
        hint of sorrow in '5 Beats Before Death', which follows the lives of
        those still alive at a home for elderly women in Burma. Here, they
        prepare with Buddhist tranquility and cheerful black humour for what the
        afterlife may bring. They speak openly and without fear about the life
        that will soon end, and about the journey that they are about to embark
        on. The only thing they are afraid of is that they might come back as
        ghosts. Therefore, it's important for the old ladies to say farewell to
        their loved ones and to face death on their own, without being attached
        to anything in this world. This is something that has to be done, but it
        isn't always easy. But they do have each other's good company, and the
        result is a cheerful, funny and wonderfully life-affirming
        film.</image:caption
