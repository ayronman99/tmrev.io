        >In commemorating WWII events in Latvia each year, several
        “controversial dates” arise. These are remembrance dates that are viewed
        differently by Latvians, Russians and Jews. The film searches for
        answers through three main characters, each a representative of their
        nationality, and categorical in their opposing way of thinking. Why is a
        date that is celebrated and honoured by one side, also a symbol of deep
        pain and injustice for another? Why are there, to this day, in a country
        as small as Latvia, three or more completely differing historical
        interpretations?</image:caption
