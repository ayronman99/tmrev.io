        >Based on a comedy TV series about Serbian "aristocracy" during the
        Turkish "answer" to the Serbian Uprising during the Serbian-Turkish war
        in the 19th century. During this time it was of the utmost importance to
        take the right steps and wisdom is really needed for making those right
        steps. With the help of a fortune teller, Karadjordje (the leader of the
        Uprising) learns that, according to a legend, somewhere in the hills
        exists a Stone of Wisdom which makes you, if you hit your head against
        it three times, more wise. So he employs his nephew Crni Gruja, with
        assistants Ceda Velja and Bole, to find him this miraculous Stone. Crni
        Gruja finds the Stone and, convinced that he is really becoming more
        wiser, decides to make some business.</image:caption
