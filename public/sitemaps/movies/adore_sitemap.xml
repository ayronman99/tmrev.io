        >Lil and Roz are two lifelong friends, having grown up together as
        neighbors in an idyllic beach town. As adults, their sons have developed
        a friendship as strong as that which binds their mothers. One summer,
        all four are confronted by simmering emotions that have been mounting
        between them, and each find unexpected happiness in relationships that
        cross the bounds of convention.</image:caption
