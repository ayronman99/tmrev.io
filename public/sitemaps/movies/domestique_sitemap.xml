        >Roman is a top level cyclist recovering from an injury through hard
        work and strict regimen. To improve his performance, he even sleeps in
        an oxygen tent installed in his bedroom. That is a bitter pill to
        swallow for his wife, Å arlota, whose long-time wish is to conceive a
        child. And so they both brim with determination, get lost in their
        obsessions, and improve their bodies to a point where they might even
        frighten themselves.</image:caption
