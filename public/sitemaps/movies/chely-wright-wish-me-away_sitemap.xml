        >After a lifetime of hiding, Chely Wright becomes the first commercial
        country music singer to come out as gay, shattering cultural stereotypes
        within Nashville, per conservative heartland family and, most
        importantly, within herself. With unprecedented access over a two-year
        period, including her private video diaries, the film layers Chely's
        rise to fame while hiding in the late 90's with the execution of her
        coming out plan, culminating in the exciting moment when she steps into
        the media glare to reveal she is gay. The film shows both the
        devastation of internalized homophobia and the transformational power of
        living an authentic life. The film also documents the conflicting
        responses from Nashville, the heartland and the LGBT community as Chely
        Wright prepares for an unknown future.</image:caption
