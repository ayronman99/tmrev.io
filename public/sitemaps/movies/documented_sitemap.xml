        >In 2011, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Jose Antonio Vargas outed
        himself as an undocumented immigrant in the New York Times Magazine.
        'Documented' chronicles his journey to America from the Philippines as a
        child; his journey through America as an immigration reform
        activist/provocateur; and his journey inward as he re-connects with his
        mother, whom he hasn't seen in 20 years.</image:caption
