        >Tedi Sarafian, writer of TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES and TANK
        GIRL makes his feature directorial debut with this horror/sci-fi
        thriller based on true events. Kingâ€™s Ransom Winery is known as one of
        the most haunted places in North America. Gruesome suicides and murders,
        suspicious fires, and strange otherworldly phenomena have occurred with
        disturbing frequency throughout the dark history of the estate, all
        linked back to a past shocking slaughter where the victim was stabbed
        thirteen times. And that unlucky number has appeared a constant
        throughout every unexplained bizarre incident. Now a group of six
        paranormal investigators have been given 48-hour weekend access to the
        winery to conduct a search for evidence of the other side. Soon they
        begin to see things and witness strange happenings causing each to act
        out of character as a sinister presence forces long-buried memories and
        deep-seated fears to bubble to the surface.</image:caption
