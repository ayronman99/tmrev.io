        >Long, long ago, in a time of magic and dragons, there lived a girl
        named Rapunzel who had the most beautiful radiant hair the world had
        ever seen. But Rapunzel's life was far from wonderful. She lived as a
        servant to Gothel, a jealous, scheming witch who kept her hidden deep in
        a forbidding forest, guarded by the enormous dragon Hugo and surrounded
        by an enchanted glass wall. However, in a twist of fate, Rapunzel's
        discovery of a magic paintbrush leads her on a journey that will unravel
        a web of deception, bring peace to two feuding kingdoms, and ultimately
        lead her to love with the help of Penelope(TM), the least intimidating
        of dragons!</image:caption
