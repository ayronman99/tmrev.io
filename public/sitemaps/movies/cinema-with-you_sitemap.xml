        >Sun-mi works at a reception desk of a public institution in Daegu,
        Korea. Nothing happens to her, and she has the same lunch every day. One
        day, a message is sent to her. This little incident in her ordinary life
        stimulates her curiosity. Saturday morning, a film director Ga-young
        participates into a Q&A section of her new movie entitled The Murder at
        Cinema. Eun-jung, a foreman in a production line, tries to find
        Min-cheol who disappeared with the book of accounts. She meets his
        acquaintances to ask where they saw him, and finally she heads to the
        cinema where she heard that he often visits.</image:caption
