        >A young Japanese woman named Eri is intelligent and promising, but
        remains mired in depression and alienation. She wanders life like a
        ghost, articulating her suffering perspectives in repetitive thoughts
        and journals. Everything changes when she decides to write a romance
        fantasy for the way she wished things would go, including an alter ego
        named Rie meeting a man named Fuyuki in love at first sight. Her debut
        novel "Soft Cream Love" is a huge hit, and Eri is catapulted to wealth
        and circles of admirers. Shy, she blows her chance to meet a cute guy
        and instead makes a pass at her clumsy unattractive agent named Hoshino,
        who walks away with his cynical attitudes born of romantic
        disappointment. When she pursues him into the street, she by chance
        meets a nice guy just as she hoped, but he never shows up at their first
        date because, unknown to her, he's hit by a car.</image:caption
