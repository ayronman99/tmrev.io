        >Omar and Pete are half brothers. When their parents are eaten by lions
        they embark on a journey to find Omar's real father. What follows is a
        funny, heart-warming journey of self-discovery for both boys...in
        Blackpool. The Choudray family represents a truly contemporary example
        of modern multicultural Britain - but what will the brothers make of
        their eccentric newfound family? Will they be going to Mecca or Mecca
        bingo? In contrast to the old fashioned stereotypes about Blackpool, the
        comedy is sharp, current and non-stop.</image:caption
