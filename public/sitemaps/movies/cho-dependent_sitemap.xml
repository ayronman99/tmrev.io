        >Miss Margaret Cho is back, and she has a few things she'd like to share
        with you. From her hilarious recounting of her backstage feud with the
        Palins during 'Dancing with the Stars' to musical interludes featuring
        Cho's witty original songs, this new concert film from our favorite
        all-American girl will have you howling from beginning to end. (You'll
        also never look at the 'American Idol' contestants the same way again,
        but you'll just have to hear Margaret explain that one.)</image:caption
