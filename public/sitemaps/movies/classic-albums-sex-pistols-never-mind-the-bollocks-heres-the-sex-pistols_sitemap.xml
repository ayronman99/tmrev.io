        >The Sex Pistols album Never Mind The Bollocks Here's The Sex Pistols is
        unquestionably one of the most important musical statements in the
        history of British music. It was in 1977, at a time when the nation was
        crippled by class division and unemployment that four working class
        teenagers with supposedly non-existent futures recorded an album that to
        this day remains as one of the greatest and most influential bodies of
        work ever recorded. This documentary features exclusive interview's with
        all four of the original members of the Sex Pistols as they take you on
        a track by track look at the making of the album. Featuring Steve Jones
        and Glen Matlock demonstrating selected riffs and licks off the album
        and explaining the development of the song writing. Candid interviews
        with Malcolm McLaren, Chris Thomas and Bill Price set the record
        straight about the recording session. Intertwining additional rare home
        video, live footage and early demo's make this release a compelling must
        see.</image:caption
