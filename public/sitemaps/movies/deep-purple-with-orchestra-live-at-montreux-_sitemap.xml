        >Filmed on the closing night of this year's Montreux Festival on July
        16, this concert features Deep Purple playing their classic hits with
        the accompaniment of a full symphony orchestra conducted by Stephen "BK"
        Bentley-Klein. The orchestral arrangements give an added depth and range
        to the familiar songs and the band, who are clearly enjoying the
        experience, deliver one of their finest performances. With a career
        stretching back into the late sixties and global album sales in excess
        of 100 million, Deep Purple need no introduction. They continue to
        record and perform around the world on an ongoing basis and remain of
        the finest hard rock bands on the planet.</image:caption
