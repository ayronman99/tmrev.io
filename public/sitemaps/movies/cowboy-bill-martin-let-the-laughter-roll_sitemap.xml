        >Cowboy Bill Martin has traveled the world doing his own brand of
        original stand-up comedy. Now, in his first one-hour special, the man
        they call, Cowboy Bill returns home to talk about love, the frailty of
        life and the magnitude of being a modern man. Sure he wears cowboy garb
        on stage and he speaks with a Texas accent, but his comedy touches
        people of all cultures. CMT, along with Inception Media Group, Middlin'
        Creative and Cowtown Drive-In Productions are proud to announce the
        World Television Debut of the stand-up comedy one-hour special, "Cowboy
        Bill Martin: Let the Laughter Roll", Saturday Night, Nov. 21,
        2015.</image:caption
