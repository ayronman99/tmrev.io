        >A young Brooklyn boy witnesses the brutal murder of his mother and
        grows up obsessed with finding her killer. Thus begins his life as a
        quiet, straight-A student by day and a self-appointed hero at night. But
        what is a real hero? And who decides what is right or wrong? As the
        boundaries blur, Sean's dual life wears on his psyche and his two worlds
        careen dangerously close to colliding. Like a graphic novel you can't
        put down, Boy Wonder challenges morality, distorting perceptions of what
        is right and what is justified, as it races to its shocking
        conclusion.</image:caption
