        >The Deception of the Novelist revolves around Justin’s character as a
        famous novelist who receives a large inheritance after his father’s
        passing. He rents out one of his inherited properties to a
        Japanese/Chinese woman named Elaine and they embark on an affair,
        causing rifts in his marriage with Jeanna Ho. One night, Elaine is
        suddenly found dead in the balcony of the house. When police start their
        investigation, they realize that there are a lot of suspicious factors
        to the case leading them to suspect that this is not their normal
        kidnapping or revenge against an unfaithful husband case.</image:caption
