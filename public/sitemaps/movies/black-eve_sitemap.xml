        >The West Jefferson Mall is closed down and set to be demolished. The
        department store was the site of a grizzly murder/suicide years before
        and now... it's the perfect location for a wild Halloween party. Two
        floors, fifty thousand square feet, loud music, booze, sexy Halloween
        costumes, and one uninvited guest. It's one hell of a night and by
        morning the only survivor, a woman with psychic abilities, is pitted in
        a cat and mouse game with the killer, running from room to room and
        using her powers to retrace the final steps of the other
        guests.</image:caption
