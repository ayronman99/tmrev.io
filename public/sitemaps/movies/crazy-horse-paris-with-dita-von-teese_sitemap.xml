        >The Crazy Horse cabaret has been a Parisian night hotspot since 1951.
        The cabaret is known for celebrating the beauty, personality and pure
        talent of its female dancers. Since opening, the Crazy Horse has
        captivated the imagination of more than six million spectators,
        including many celebrities, with its stunning sexy shows. Since 2001,
        the Crazy Horse shows are also performed at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas.
        In February 2009, Dita Von Teese, the uber glamorous icon and
        international striptease diva, was the first guest star to appear in a
        Crazy Horse show. This DVD showcases the full show including three of
        Ditaâ€™s sensual numbers.</image:caption
