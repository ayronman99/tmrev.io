        >Hiyoko wants to become an artist like her mother, but her father would
        prefer that she took a different career path. Enraged when she notices
        that he took all paintings done by her mother from the house, she
        decides to run away. Unable to find a place to sleep among her
        acquaintances, she ends up at Asylum Stadium, an abandoned field that is
        shelter for many homeless, but that is about to be torn down by the
        government. There she meets Akira, a strange individual capable of
        flying.</image:caption
