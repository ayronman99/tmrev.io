        >Prior to any other treatment, the emulsion is covered with layers of
        chemical products, resulting in a black filmstrip. "The black leader can
        be anticipated as Malevitch's white painting: a space in which
        everything is possible, the space of absolute potentiality and
        virtuality." This is because cinema, contrary to painting, gives light
        to its own image, via the lamp projector. This is not about covering a
        blank surface with forms and colors since they already exist on the
        black film. Whilst ALL OVER is a film made without "instrumentation"
        (like a camera), it also differs from direct films in that the film
        remains untouched by any tool (not even the hand). As in dripping,
        materials and color are spontaneously laid down on the film in
        semi-controlled gestures, which create a shower of colored dots. The
        soundtrack functions according to the same principle: the sound, in all
        its expressions, is formed using one single formal
        element.</image:caption
