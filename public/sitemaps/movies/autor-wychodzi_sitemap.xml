        >A young woman, Anna, is getting ready to make her own movie. After a
        while, she discovers that she is just a heroine in the movie and nothing
        really depends on her. Rebellious against the author, she writes her own
        film, recreating the characters from scratch - but neither do her
        characters want to be heroes in someone else's film. The story of the
        heroine is intertwined with the story of a critic who "chased" writers
        all his life to finally find out that his efforts were
        pointless.</image:caption
