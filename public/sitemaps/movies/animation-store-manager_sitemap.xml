        >This is the Animation Store Manager!! Anime Tenchou is a CM character
        for Animate, one of Japan's biggest retailer of anime, games, and manga.
        The character series was created by Shimamoto Kazuhiko for publicity
        purposes. Later adapted into a manga, a weekly radio drama and this OVA
        animated by GAINAX and directed by Anno Hideaki. Anizawa Meito is the
        blazing store manager. He is a fireball who loves animation merchandise
        at heart. He takes over the dying wish of the former store manager,
        though still alive, who was attacked by the rival store and becomes a
        “store manager” of newly opened animation goods specialty store,
        Animate. The scarlet, “store manager visor” is his
        trademark.</image:caption
