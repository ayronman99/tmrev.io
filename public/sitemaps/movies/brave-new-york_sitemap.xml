        >BRAVE NEW YORK is a free-form documentary that loosely chronicles the
        last twelve years of intense change in the East Village "hood." From the
        reopening of a newly curfewed Tompkins Square Park and Wigstock in '92
        to the destruction of the cherished Loisaida Community Gardens, beyond
        the yuppie invasions of the "dot com" years to the present era,
        indelibly stamped with post 9/11 grief, this durable, lusty neighborhood
        survives in spite of a real estate gold rush that has excluded all but
        the well-to-do. The movie's main voices are those of the artists and
        street people whose wisdom and commentaries upon the dominant culture
        give us pause amidst the speedy approach of a "Brave New World." This
        Overview was taken from Fandor, where this film is available.
