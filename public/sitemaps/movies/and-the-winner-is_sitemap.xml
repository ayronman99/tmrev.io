        >Comedy - The hypocrisy lurking behind politics and small-town life is
        revealed in this sharp, hilarious satire that finds Centerville shaking
        up its mayoral election by forcing the candidates to participate in an
        "Election Pageant." Seven eccentric, competitive locals run for office
        despite their many flaws, and during the pageant, show off their skills
        at baby kissing, photo ops, handshaking and other skills needed by a
        savvy politician. - Jerry Springer, Kevin McClatchy, Doug
