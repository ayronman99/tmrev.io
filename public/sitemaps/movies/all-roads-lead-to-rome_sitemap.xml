        >Maggie is an uptight, single mother and college writing teacher from
        New York City. In an effort to reconnect with her troubled teen daughter
        Summer, she decides to embark on a journey to a Tuscan village where she
        frequented in her younger days. Upon arrival, Maggie runs into Luca a
        handsome former lover who is still a bachelor and lives with his
        eighty-year-old mother Carmen. Summer (missing her “bad boy” boyfriend
        in NYC) and Carmen (secretly planning a wedding against Luca’s wishes to
        MARCELINO, her one true love in Rome) impulsively steal Luca’s car and
        race off to Rome. Maggie and Luca quickly pursue allowing the two
        mismatched couples to spend some time together and develop a new
        understanding of each other.</image:caption
