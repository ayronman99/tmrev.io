        >Jane lives in London with Richard, her boyfriend. When she was five,
        her mother was murdered, she recently lost a baby in a car crash and now
        she’s plagued by nightmares of a knife-wielding, blue-eyed man.
        Desperate to ease her pain, Jane decides to follow her new neighbor’s
        advice to attend a Black Mass, only to fan her already horrible visions,
        making her reality a living hell. Is there an escape from the clutches
        of the darkest evil?</image:caption
