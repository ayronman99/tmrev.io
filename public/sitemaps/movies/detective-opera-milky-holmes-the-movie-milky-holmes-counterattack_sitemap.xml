        >The four members of Milky Holmes are going on a study tour. While
        soaking in the hot springs among snow monkeys, alarms interrupt the
        relaxing environment! It was the work of the Thief Empire. A fierce
        battle between Milky Holmes and the Thief Empire begins, with both sides
        using their Toys (special powers). Furthermore, with the arrival of the
        Genius 4, a three-way fight occurs! In the midst of battle, a violent
        lightning strikes from the sky. Struck by the lightning, the four Milky
        Holmes girls lose their abilities.</image:caption
