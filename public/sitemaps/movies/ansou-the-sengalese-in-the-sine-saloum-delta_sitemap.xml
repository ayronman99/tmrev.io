        >This film was made in the Delta of the Saloum (Senegal), over a period
        of four years and shot during different seasons. It is the story of a
        young boy, named Ansou, of the Mandingo ethnic group who wants to be a
        nature guide specializing in ornithology. With a sense of humor, he
        tells of his life in primary school in the village where he was born and
        also in the 'Bolons' with his fishermen friends and Dembo, the animal
        tracker.</image:caption
