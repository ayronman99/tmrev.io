        >Neil Black is a good looking schmoozer who can sell anything to anyone,
        literally. The beautiful Catherine (Madison Walls) doesn’t seem to close
        deals as easily as Mr. Black (Steven Bauer) and soon realizes her sales
        room is headed for disaster. Not able to handle rejection or accept
        failure, Catherine is forced to hand over her sales team to Neil Black,
        and watch as he turns her unproductive lazy sales room into a prosperous
        and successful “money room.” Basically, the plot focuses on the
        transformation of Catherine’s failing sales room and the blossoming
        relationship between her and Neil Black.</image:caption
