        >In a work-driven world where time is the ultimate dictator, a
        mysterious sandman spreads chaos and confusion. Even the best employees
        of the system get infected by his wondrous dream powder and lose sight
        of the once so dominating clock. Alex Deprins, future employee of the
        year, becomes one of those ‘victims’. In his dreams he comes into
        contact with a strange new world, where a lady in red captivates his
        heart. Once awake he has to make a difficult decision. Does he stay in
        his familiar, but deadly rule-bound world or does he seek the road to
        salvation in his dreams?</image:caption
