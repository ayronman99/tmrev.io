        >El Vago (Martinez) has recently won an old-fashioned billiards hall in
        a heated contest with the joint's former owner El Mexicano (Jesus
        Ochoa). The first order of business: El Vago enlists the aid of
        ambitious assistant El Perro (Luna) in shooting an instructional
        billiards video. Trouble soon begins to brew, however, as El Perro is
        repeatedly distracted from his camera duties by El Mexicano's sexy
        daughter La Pujara (Hidalgo). Increasingly aggressive in his attempts to
        transform the venerable gaming establishment into a techno-throbbing
        youth hot spot, El Perro later crosses the line when he uses his lens to
        shoot a pornographic video with willing exhibitionist La Pujara. As an
        impressive array of billiards champs descend upon the pool hall for a
        high profile tournament, El Mexicano comes into possession of the steamy
        sex tape and flies into a vengeful fury.</image:caption
