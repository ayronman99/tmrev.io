        >10 years has passed since the confrontation between Kira and L. Again,
        Shinigami sends death notes to the ground and due to this, the world
        soon falls into chaos. Tsukuru is a member of the Death Note special
        task force team with 6 other investigators including Matsuda who
        experienced the Kira case of 10 years ago. Mass murders caused by the
        death note takes place on Wall Street in the U.S., Shibuya in Japan and
        other places. World famous private investigator Ryuzaki, who is the
        rightful successor of L, also investigates the mass murders. They
        discover that 6 death notes exists in the world. A computer virus called
        Kira spreads in the world. A message in the Kira virus says to turn in 6
        death notes. A person who has 6 death notes overwhelm the world. The
        confrontation begins between the person who wants Kiraâ€™s revival and the
