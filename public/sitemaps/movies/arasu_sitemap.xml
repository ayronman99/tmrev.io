        >Shivaraj falls in love with his manager's daughter, Shruthi. However,
        she refuses his proposal and challenges him to first earn Rs 5000
        without using any influence. Shruthi makes Shivaraj a better person, and
        they both fall in love. But Shruthi finds out that her best friend
        Aishwarya is also in love with Shivaraj so she gives up her love for her
        best friend. Later when Aishwarya learns about SHruthi too being in love
        with him, she feels guilty and backs off the relationship. Instead,
        Shivaraj comes up with a mind baffling situation and he sets up both the
        girls with two of his friends and he finds another girl for
        himself.</image:caption
