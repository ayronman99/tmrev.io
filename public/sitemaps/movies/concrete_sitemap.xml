        >Emerging artists working in their hometown Reykjavík and abroad share
        with the viewers the diverse processes that spark a work of art.
        Threading a line between realism and performance, the film explores
        inspiration and creativity through an intimate two-year collaboration,
        providing an insight into a booming scene. Pouring Coke into empty Fanta
        bottles, Ásmundur asks himself "What is art?" suggesting that it is
        embedded in what an artist does. Accordingly, rather that focusing on
        the end product, the film deals with what the artist is up to before it
        comes to that.</image:caption
