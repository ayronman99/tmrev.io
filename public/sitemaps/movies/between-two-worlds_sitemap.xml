        >Marianne Winckler, a well-known author, goes to live in northern France
        to research for her new book on the subject of job insecurity. Without
        revealing her true identity, she gets hired as a cleaner, working with a
        group of other women. In this new role, she experiences financial
        instability and social invisibility first-hand. But she also discovers
        mutual assistance and solidarity, strong bonds shared by these
        behind-the-scenes working women.</image:caption
