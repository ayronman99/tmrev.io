        >A reunion of family and friends becomes an unforgettable vacation when
        two teenage boys discover their secret feelings toward one another. The
        relationship is eventually exposed to their families - leading to denial
        and a questioning of self-worth from each of the boys. The exposed
        relationship brings to light that one of the boys was previously
        institutionalized for his homosexuality by his older
        brother.</image:caption
