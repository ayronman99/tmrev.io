        >Ben works in a morgue. Ben's wife left him and he is into various kinds
        of alternative sexuality. Teresa dies of an ecstasy overdose on the
        dance floor. When she is brought to the morgue, she is resurrected -how
        shall I say?- in Ben's arms (that part based on a true story). From this
        starting point, the film revolves around the interactions between them
        and Boris (orgy fan), Abdel (no sentimental life), Ducon (wants to kill
        himself), Nico (dying of AIDS), etc... A social study of the 90s with
        heavy references to sex and deat</image:caption
