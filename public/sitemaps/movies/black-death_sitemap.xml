        >As the plague decimates medieval Europe, rumours circulate of a village
        immune from the plague. There is talk of a necromancer who leads the
        village and is able to raise the dead. A fearsome knight joined by a
        cohort of soldiers and a young monk are charged by the church to
        investigate. Their journey is filled with danger, but it's upon entering
        the village that their true horror begins.</image:caption
