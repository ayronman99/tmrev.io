        >Across the Border is a polyglot portrait of ideas about borders at the
        beginning of the 21st century. In an episodic journey five directors
        from Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Slovenia, present
        their view and vision of nation, identity and Europe: By placing their
        personal cinematographic imprint on multifaceted portraits of their home
        countries, they open up a broad space for encounters with the strangers
        next door.</image:caption
