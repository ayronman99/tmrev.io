        >Hong Kong, Oct 2013. Following a long period of social unrest over bank
        failures, property speculation and government mismanagement, crowds
        gather to demonstrate in front of the Legislative Council building.
        Panic ensues as a bomb is reported inside the LegCo building, planted by
        someone calling himself "Skywalker". Meanwhile, a branch of Hong Kong
        &amp; China Banking Corporation is held up by two young people in masks
        - chemistry student Lang (Kelvin Kwan) and social drop-out Fish (Fish
        Liew). Among the people in the bank are disillusioned former teacher Yue
        Chung-tak (Teddy Robin), councilman Ho Chung-lai (K.K. Cheung), his
        mistress Rebecca (Maggie Chan), the bank's investment saleswoman Luk
        Wan-yee (Kay Tse), her philandering boyfriend Victor Lo (Wilfred Lau),
        and Wan-yee's onetime boyfriend, police detective Kin-ho (Paul Wong).
        All have their own reasons for being in the bank that
        day.</image:caption
