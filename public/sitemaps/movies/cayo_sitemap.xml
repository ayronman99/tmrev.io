        >Ivan, Julia and Kike were born and grew up in Culebra where they shared
        a close friendship. Ivan ventures in a small boat and stumbles on Cayo,
        a small island close by. Here he finds peace of mind, and the island has
        a healing effect on him. When federal authorities try to keep Ivan away
        from Cayo, they find themselves face to face with a community that will
        defend Ivan's need to visit the island. Based on a true story of love
        and friendship that will touch your heart, this wrenching drama was
        filmed in the beautiful natural scenery of Culebra, Puerto
        Rico.</image:caption
