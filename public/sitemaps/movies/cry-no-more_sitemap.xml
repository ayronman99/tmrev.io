        >Moroccan filmmaker Narjiss Nejjar makes her feature debut with the
        drama Cry No More. Former prostitute Mina (Raouia) is released from
        prison after a 25-year sentence. Bus driver Fahd (Khalid Benchegra)
        returns her to the isolated Berber village of prostitutes. Because the
        only men allowed in are customers, Fahd pretends to be Mina's son. Fahd
        falls for Mina's angry daughter, Hala (Siham Assif), who wants to stop
        the village curse. Hala has a daughter of her own, Zinba Rafiqua Belhaj,
        who's about to undergo a traditional loss-of-virginity ritual. As she
        forms a plan to stop the sex work-cycle, Mina doesn't let Hala know her
        real identity, although the village elders in the mountain cliffs
        remember her. Cry No More was shown during the Director's Fortnight at
        the 2003 Cannes Film Festival.</image:caption
