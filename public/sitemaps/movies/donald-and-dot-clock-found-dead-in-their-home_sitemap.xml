        >Donald is a failed, but hopeful dancer who can't keep a job. Dot is a
        psychic hot-line councelor who is obsessed with the "Rodent Harmonic
        Balance." Dot's rats take over the house and prevent the couple from
        consummating their marriage. Eventually, Donald takes a stand. He sneaks
        into the house when Dot is away, applies rat poison everywhere, and
        kills the varmints. When She discovers what he has done, Dot throws
        Donald out.</image:caption
