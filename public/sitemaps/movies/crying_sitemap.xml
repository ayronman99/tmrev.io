        >Bill is an accountant at a film company. His boss is out for the
        weekend so the office is under his commands. Nadia is an aspiring young
        film director who thinks she is a genious. They don't know each other.
        Through them we see the lives of their family and friends. Nick a gay
        former child TV star, Alexander s fat boy who wears dead singers
        T-shirts, Monique a french albino with burned legs, Anna the "slut" and
        others...Bill does not understand that he is getting older. He is fond
        of little girls especially his 14 year old neighbor Jenny. Nadia on the
        other hand seem to be attracted only by artsy fartsy men.</image:caption
