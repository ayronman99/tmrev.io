        >We know Aung San Suu Kyi as "a golden bird in a cage"; she is a
        valuable icon representing freedom and democracy of which the suppressed
        population of Burma project much hope for. In the West she stands out as
        a symbol of peace and reconciliation. She has been awarded countless
        prizes for her effort, among them the Nobel Peace Prize. But who is the
        person and woman behind it all? The Military Dictatorship has on several
        occasions offered her the opportunity to leave the country. But why does
        Aung San Suu Kyi voluntarily choose to stay in her captivity instead of
        going into exile? Lady of No Fear offers a strong and fascinating
        glimpse into Aung San Suu Kyis life and portrays some of the
        consequences her freedom struggle has had, not only for her, but also
        for her closest friends and family indeed.</image:caption
