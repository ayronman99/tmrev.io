        >Joanne Connors is a successful obstetrician whose life is turned upside
        down when her partner at their fertility clinic, Dr. Jake Hines, is
        brutally murdered. Trying to rebuild her life, Joanne attends a lavish
        charity function, where she meets Michael. But by the end of the
        evening, Michael is dead - murdered. It quickly becomes apparent that
        the assassin's intended victim was actually Joanne. She must now race to
        find out who wants her dead before the killer can strike at her
        again.</image:caption
