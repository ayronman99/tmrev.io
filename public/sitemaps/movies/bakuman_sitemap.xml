        >Moritaka Mashiro doesn't want to follow in the path of his uncle who
        worked as a manga artist, but ultimately died because of exhaustion.
        Moritaka Mashiro figures he will graduate from school and work at an
        office. Things change though when falls in love with a girl at school.
        The girl, who hopes to become a voice actress, tells Moritaka they can
        marry, but only after they both achieve their dreams. Moritaka then
        teams up with fellow classmate Akito Takagi to publish their first
        manga.</image:caption
