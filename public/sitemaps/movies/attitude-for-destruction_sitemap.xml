        >Hollywood Roses is starting to make it big and they’re ready for the
        next step. Of course all their success has come after the band killed
        off the original founder, Drake. Once they realized he was holding them
        back, they turned on him and now they’re the best thing out there. Of

        have to deal with Drake’s Ghost!</image:caption
