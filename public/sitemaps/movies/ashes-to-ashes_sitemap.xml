        >America has yet to heal from the trauma of its darkest era, and Winfred
        Rembert is living proof of that. Rembert, who lived on a plantation,
        joined the civil rights movement as a teen and was put to work on a
        chain gang, is a rare survivor of a lynching attempt. Decades later, he
        still carries the scars. “That lynching is on my back, and it’s dragging
        me down, even today,” he says. As he etches the history, bloodsoaked and
        cruel, into leatherwork, fellow artist Dr. Shirley Jackson Whitaker
        organizes a different kind of ceremony to search for healing. “It’s not
        just black history,” she says. “This is American
        history.”</image:caption
