        >450,000 years ago our ancestors descended from the heavens to engineer
        the first human beings. To us they were Giants that ruled as Gods over
        mankind. Now new evidence and scientific research acknowledges their
        existence on earth but reveals when they will return. The truth of their
        real origin and purpose is much more bizarre and amazing than anything
        previously believed. From the Garden of Eden to the Great Flood; from
        the God of the Bible to the secrets of Enoch all shall be revealed.
