        >Araucanía Herida, is the portrait of the repression that was unleashed
        in the provinces of Cautín and Malleco, after the coup d'état in 1973 by
        the armed forces, together with numerous civilians from different towns
        and cities of Araucanía. The documentary is a journey from mountain
        range to sea, passing through different locations where people who lived
        the facts, tell us what happened in each of those places and what they
        lived. Not only being a case, but several in a geographical territory,
        one after another each testimony, we unveiled a coordinated and ruthless
        strategy of repression, not portrayed before in any region of
        Chile.</image:caption
