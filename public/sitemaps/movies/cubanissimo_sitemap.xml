        >This 90-minute documentary about the history of Cuban music includes
        interviews with music historians as well as Cuban musicians, both young
        and old, who help keep the vibrant style alive today. Through the use of
        photographs, music, and commentary, Cubanissimo traces Cuban music from
        its roots in the small island nation to the widespread effect on
        mainstream music that it has had in the present day.</image:caption
