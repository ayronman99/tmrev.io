        >Michael is a cop chasing uncommon serial killer Sung Ping, who one day
        kills off a scummy triad on almost a whim. Liking the aftermath, he
        proceeds to plan his next few killings much to the dismay of the local
        triads. Meanwhile, reporter Hak makes the real-life crime drama the
        fodder for his crime fiction serial. Before long, Ping begins using the
        fiction to fuel his own plans, and soon Hak is concerned that he may be
        responsible.</image:caption
