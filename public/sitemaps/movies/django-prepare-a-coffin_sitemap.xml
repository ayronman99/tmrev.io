        >A mysterious gunfighter named Django is employed by a local crooked
        political boss as a hangman to execute innocent locals framed by the
        boss, who wants their land. What the boss doesn't know is that Django
        isn't hanging the men at all, just making it look like he is, and using
        the men he saves from the gallows to build up his own "gang" in order to
        take revenge on the boss, who, with Django's former best friend, caused
        the death of his wife years before.</image:caption
