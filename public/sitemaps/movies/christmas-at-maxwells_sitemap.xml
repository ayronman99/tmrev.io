        >A successful American family retreat to their summer home on the banks
        of Lake Erie to find meaning in life, illness, loss, and change this
        Christmas. With a successful career in the wine business, and two
        amazing children, what more can a family ask for. But this Christmas
        will change the Austin family forever with Suzie falling ill. With
        Andrew struggling over his wife's ill health and the children trying to
        find peace and solace on their own, only a miracle can help them through
        this Christmas.</image:caption
