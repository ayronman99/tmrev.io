        >The daughter of a famous writer believes her mother is responsible for
        her father's death. Since then the relationship between them is cooled
        increasingly, to the point that she did not invite her mother when she
        marries. The husband, far from promoting good relations between them,
        takes them away even more, which sees the mother and begins to suspect
        him when he receives a note threatening to kill his
        daughter.</image:caption
