        >Chastity Moore believes there are three ways a woman can get a
        husband....love him, live with him, or leave him. She tried loving her
        man but he chose to serve his country instead. She tried living with her
        next boyfriend and that didn't work. So Chastity's mother, Patricia,
        wants her daughter to use her three ways to get a husband - love him
        past his pain, let him be a man and if all else fails wait on
        God.</image:caption
