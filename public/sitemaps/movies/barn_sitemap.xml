        >The documentary provides an unprecedented glimpse into Young and the
        Horse’s creative process, as they took to tape in Colorado’s Rocky
        Mountains during the Covid-19 pandemic. Kicking off with a note of
        gratitude from Young (“I’m so glad we’re fuckin’ here!”), the trailer
        shows what things were like as the legendary band got back into their
        element, in the wild, making music in a restored, 19th-century log barn
        under a full, glowing moon. The film captures the group—a 50-year-old
        musical family that includes, Billy Talbot, Ralph Molina and Nils
        Lofgren —building the powerful new record, but also their easy humour
        and enduring brotherhood. - The Sound Cafe
