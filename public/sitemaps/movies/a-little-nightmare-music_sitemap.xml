        >The con­cert begins. The music is sub­lime. Not even a pin would dare
        drop. Sud­denly, a cell­phone rings and the mad­ness starts. The pianist
        loses his hand, the vio­lin­ist, while tun­ing, falls asleep, and later
        wakes up in the mid­dle of a motor­way, trans­formed into a
        “River­dancer”. When the pianist returns, the piano is locked, telling
        him to insert his credit card. Mean­while, the vio­lin­ist loses his bow
        to a vac­uum cleaner and his part­ner just talks on the phone while
        read­ing a paper, eat­ing, and, play­ing the piano upside down all at
        the same time. These and many other “night­mares” unfold before
        audi­ences’ eyes and ears. “A Lit­tle Night­mare Music” is a unique
        show, full of vir­tu­os­ity, enchant­ing music and zany, out­ra­geous
        humour. Ideal for audi­ences aged 8 to 88, this show is sure to
        cap­ti­vate you and crack you up whether you’re a clas­si­cal music
        enthu­si­ast or the type who runs for cover, at the mere men­tion of
        Mozart.</image:caption
