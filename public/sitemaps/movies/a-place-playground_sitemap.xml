        >A Place (Playground) (2004) by Krassimir Terziev focuses on one of the
        playgrounds situated in a typical working-class neighborhood, built in
        1983 in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria. The environment recorded on
        video is characteristic of a concoction of preplanned hillocks that are
        cut across by canals and ponds which are linked by curved footbridges.
        Terziev highlights the architectural ensemble characteristic of
        prop-like tanks, rockets, military airplanes and canons—all arranged as
        if on a battlefield. The metal items painted in the same colors—yellow,
        red and blue—were manufactured from the materials used in the production
        of military equipment. Importantly, the film turns to the environment as
        metaphor, as it documents everyday activities in a space packed with
        residents who are unaware of the changing ideologies behind their urban
        surroundings, as communist ideology gradually gives way to capitalist
        consumerism.</image:caption
