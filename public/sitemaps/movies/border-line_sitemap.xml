        >Three storylines interweave in Border Line. Kurosawa (Murakami Jun)
        finds himself driving a taciturn young man named Matsuda (Sawaki Tetsu)
        halfway to Hokkaido, after accidentally knocking him off his bike; their
        fragile bond can last only so long. The housewife Aikawa Misa (Aso Yumi)
        tries desperately to hold her family together when her husband gets laid
        off and her son is so frightened of bullies at school that he throws up
        in the car; sheâ€™s reduced to taking a McJob in a convenience store. And
        Miyaji (Mitsuishi Ken), who collects debts for a yakuza gang, gets into
        trouble when his partner Kitajima puts personal need above
        duty.</image:caption
