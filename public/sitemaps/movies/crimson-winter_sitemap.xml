        >Humans massacred their race, wrote them out of history, and pushed them
        into myth... Now in the midst of a Vampire civil war, an exiled Vampire
        prince has escaped into the mountains of the new America, building a
        hidden army for revenge against his family. Years later, in the dead of
        winter, a group of grad students start their research on the
        disappearance of wildlife in those very mountains. When they come close
        to the truth, they begin the fight for their own survival. As the fight
        escalates, the Vampire prince descends upon the conflict. He is forced
        to visit his dark past as the fates of the student's are
        decided.</image:caption
