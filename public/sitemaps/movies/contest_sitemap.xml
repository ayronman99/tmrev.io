        >Bullied high school student Tommy is suddenly befriended by his chief
        tormentor, Matt, the school's most popular student and star athlete.
        Tommy is suspicious, but is forced to accept the awkward friendship in
        order to enter a cooking contest with a big prize. And besides, it's so
        much easier to impress his crush, Sarah, when he's not getting beat up
        by Matt and his team. As the cooking contest heats up, Sarah sniffs out
        a conspiracy, but nobody wants to hear about it. Can Tommy trust his
        budding friendship with Matt or is it all a huge joke on
        him?</image:caption
