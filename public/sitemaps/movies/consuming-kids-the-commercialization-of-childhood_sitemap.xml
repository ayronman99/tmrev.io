        >Consuming Kids throws desperately needed light on the practices of a
        relentless multi-billion dollar marketing machine that now sells kids
        and their parents everything from junk food and violent video games to
        bogus educational products and the family car. Drawing on the insights
        of health care professionals, children's advocates, and industry
        insiders, the film focuses on the explosive growth of child marketing in
        the wake of deregulation, showing how youth marketers have used the
        latest advances in psychology, anthropology, and neuroscience to
        transform American children into one of the most powerful and profitable
        consumer demographics in the world. Consuming Kids pushes back against
        the wholesale commercialization of childhood, raising urgent questions
        about the ethics of children's marketing and its impact on the health
        and well-being of kids.</image:caption
