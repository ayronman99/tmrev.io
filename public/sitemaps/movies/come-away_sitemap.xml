        >Before Alice went to Wonderland, and before Peter became Pan, they were
        brother and sister. When their eldest brother dies in a tragic accident,
        they each seek to save their parents from their downward spirals of
        despair until finally they are forced to choose between home and
        imagination, setting the stage for their iconic journeys into Wonderland
        and Neverland.</image:caption
