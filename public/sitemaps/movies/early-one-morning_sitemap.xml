        >Monday morning. Paul Wertret, 50, heads off to his job as a manager at
        the International Credit and Trade Bank. He arrives at 8 o'clock on the
        dot, as usual. He enters a meeting room, takes out a gun and kills two
        of his bosses. Then he locks himself in his office. As he waits for the
        inevitable police assault, this ordinary man looks back over his life
        and the events that led him to commit such an act.</image:caption
