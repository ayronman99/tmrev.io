        >Taking drugs and intense cycling are the only things to which Cloud
        Rock La Belle has remained faithful throughout his life. Now his son,
        Kaleo, challenges his eccentric father to a bike trip. Cycling through
        the Pacific Northwest, Kaleo questions his father's search for truth and
        demands justification for his absence in his life. This film explores
        their failed father and son relationship and questions whether the
        hippie concept of freedom ultimately failed.</image:caption
