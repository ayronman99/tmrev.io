        >Henry Waghorn and his father Henry Waghorn Senior run a circus of
        performing chickens, however the chickens’ real value may be more to do
        with taste than performance. An offer from Theo Theodolite to join him
        in a fried chicken outlet has little attraction for the Waghorn family.
        However Thoe’s daughter Wilga sees a different side to Henry and his
        training skills and their relationship might have flourished if Henry
        Senior hadn’t had an unfortunate accident. Finally the truth of the
        accident is discovered and the explosive finale sheds new light on the
        need for better-trained chickens.</image:caption
