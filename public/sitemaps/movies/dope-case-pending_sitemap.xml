        >Hip-hop stars Coolio and Kid Frost star in this hard-edged urban drama.
        Devon is a talented high school athlete who seems to be on top of the
        world; he's a good bet to win a college scholarship and might even go on
        to a career in pro ball. But being in the wrong place at the wrong time
        during a party lands Devon in jail, and unable to convince anyone of his
        innocence, he is sentenced to a stretch in prison. Life behind bars
        hardens Devon and teaches him more about crime than he ever knew before,
        and when after his release he discovers most of his chances for a better
        life have dried up, he's tempted to put the knowledge he gained in jail
        to use on the streets.</image:caption
