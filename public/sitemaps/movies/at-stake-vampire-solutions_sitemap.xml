        >Memphis film student, Evan Shandling, decides that his senior film
        should be about how the economy has effected local businesses. So with
        that in mind, Evan packs up his camera and heads south into North
        Mississippi to document one of the hardest hit and most dangerous jobs
        around, vampire removal. Embedding himself with the small vampire
        removal company, At Stake: Vampire Solutions (AS:VS), Evan documents,
        interview and goes on calls with AS:VS workers as they struggle to keep
        their business afloat and make it to the next day alive.</image:caption
