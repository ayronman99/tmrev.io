        >Area 51, flying saucers from another world - and the program to create
        a fierce technology. Bob Lazar remains the singular most famous and
        controversial name in the world of UFOs. The reason you know about Area
        51 is because Lazar came forward and told you about it. His disclosures
        have turned his life upside-down and he has tried to stay out of the
        spotlight. For this reason, he has never let any filmmaker into the
        private world of his daily life - that is - until now. Corbell’s film
        explores Lazar’s claims through the lens of thirty years - providing
        rare and never before revealed footage - guaranteed to alter the
        landscape of the debate.</image:caption
