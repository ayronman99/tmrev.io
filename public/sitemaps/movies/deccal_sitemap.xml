        >We have entered a new era...The Antichrist, whose coming has been
        announced for centuries, is now born. Humankind is meant to be thrown in
        a vortex of fear and despair. While seeds are being planted somewhere in
        the heart of Istanbul, Turkey, all prophecies are coming true. Evil will
        spread like a virus throughout the World. Satan will find a body in
        which to incarnate and prepare to reign of terror at the head of an army
        of Devils. DECCAL is the first of a trilogy meant to represent the pure
        essence of evil.</image:caption
