        >Serge Tanneur is at the pinnacle of his acting career when he decides
        to turn his back on show business and become a hermit living off of
        France’s Atlantic coast. Three years later, Gauthier Valence, a beloved
        TV actor, shows up on the island to offer Serge a role in his
        directorial debut – a rendition of Molière’s classic play, “The
        Misanthrope”. Serge refuses at first, but then suggests that they
        rehearse the first scene and after five days he’ll decide if he wants to
        dothe play or not. What ensues is a battle of brawn and wits and
        peculiar encounters with a hotel maid who longs to be a pornstar and an
        Italian divorcée.</image:caption
