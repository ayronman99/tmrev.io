        >The true story of the rise and fall of Creation Records and its
        infamous founder Alan McGee; the man responsible for supplying the “Brit
        Pop” soundtrack to the ‘90s, a decade of cultural renaissance known as
        Cool Britannia. From humble beginnings to Downing Street soirées, from
        dodging bailiffs to releasing multi-platinum albums, Creation had it
        all. Breakdowns, bankruptcy, fights and friendships… and not forgetting
        the music. Featuring some of the greatest records you have ever heard,
        we follow Alan through a drug-fuelled haze of music and mayhem, as his
        rock’n’roll dream brings the world Oasis, Primal Scream, and other
        generation-defining bands.</image:caption
