        >A 2003 TVNZ documentary on the capture of the criminal responsible for
        one of New Zealand's most heinous crimes. On June 19, 1987, 6-year-old
        Teresa Maida Cormack pulled on an oversized red raincoat and left her
        home to walk the short distance to Richmond School. 8 days later her
        body was found in a shallow shingel grave on Whiraniki beach. Teresa
        Cormack had been sexually assualted and suffocated. 3 pubic hairs were
        found on Teresa as well as semen, but in 1987 DNA tests were just being
        introduced and the DNA taken from her wasn't enough to be tested as a
        means to identify her killer. In 1993 Detective Sergeant Brian Schaab
        was put in charge of the case that for over 6 years still remained a
        mystery - yet he did not give up. With DNA becoming a popular way of
        indentification, the pubic hairs were tested and a DNA profile of the
        killer was founded. The long list of suspects narrowed down as suspects
        were eliminated and one name remained - Jules Mikus.</image:caption
