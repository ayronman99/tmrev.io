        >The Karugamo High School Baseball Team has not been doing well. After
        losing badly to the Eagles, many of the players leave, and the team now
        has only eight players, one too few to play a game. Going against his
        principles, the main character Harumaki Shunpei decides to buy a
        baseball robot. However, since he does not have enough money, he ends up
        buying the maid robot named Azusa. Even though Azusa has a warm heart
        and strong determination, it doesn't appear that she stands a chance
        against her adversaries who were top-of-the-line baseball robots. The
        team's only hope seems to lie in a secret buried within Azusa's clouded
        past.</image:caption
