        >Lila, grows up in the high-rises of the Marolles in Brussels. Along
        with her sister and her friends, she dreams of becoming a dancer and
        revolutionising the world of hip-hop. While her friends stay in
        Brussels, Lila leaves everything - comfort, family - behind to go to
        Paris, where she is certain her persistence will pay off. Except that
        life in Paris quickly takes an unexpected turn. The woman who dreamed of
        being a choreographer ends up as a lap dancer in a rap video, and thatâ€™s
        only the beginning of her disillusionment. After a chance meeting with a
        drama teacher, she bears her heart and soul on stage and begins doing
        stand-up. This time, her unusual dedication leads her to find her
        calling. However, she still has to fight one final battle: convincing
        her father that she has made the right choice.</image:caption
