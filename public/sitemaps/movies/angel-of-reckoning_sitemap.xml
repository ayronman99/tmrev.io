        >Rachel, a female war veteran returns home only to launch her own
        personal vendetta against the criminal underworld when a family member
        mysteriously dies. The underworld kingpin rules with an iron fist and
        those below her are terrified when her name is even mentioned. In order
        to get closer to the inner sanctum, Rachel takes on the identity of
        "Angel" a go-go dancer at a popular nightclub. As "Angel" learns details
        about the organization, she begins to exact her revenge against anyone
        she deems responsible for her family member's death. However, a
        detective is hot on Angel's trail as he investigates the death and
        destruction left in her wake. After one woman proclaims war against a
        band of drug dealers, pornographers, and criminal kingpins, will
        vengeance rule above all else?</image:caption
