        >This fascinating program tells the story of the music and artists that
        have influenced Bob Dylan throughout his career. Although his reputation
        as a songwriter stands supreme, Dylan has often covered tracks from
        vintage blues, folk and country performers or incorporated elements from
        them into his own material. "Down The Tracks" explores the lives and
        work of many of these artists and how Dylan interacted with them through
        archive performance and interview footage alongside new interviews and
        documentary material.</image:caption
