        >Marco leads a double life. As Marco, he is a construction worker but
        rich ladies craving sexual excitation know him as Patrick. As Marco he
        is married to Fanny, an ambitious young woman who has opened her own
        hairdressing salon in partnership with her friend Rosalie. Marco/Patrick
        is not a male prostitute at heart: in fact he does the job in order to
        support his wife's business. Which doesn't prevent Judith, an elegant
        tele-shopping presenter who buys his services, from falling in love with
        him. But when Fanny learns what Marco does and with whom, she first gets
        mad but soon starts interfering in their affair.</image:caption
