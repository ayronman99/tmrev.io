        >Jerry is a strange and solitary boy who lives with his young neglectful
        mother in a run down apartment. He spends his weekends hidden away in
        his bedroom making model figurines and watching TV alone. While
        investigating a damp stain on his bedroom wall, Jerry peels off some
        wallpaper, revealing a seductive alien orifice growing behind the
        plaster. After spending an ever increasing amount of time in his bedroom
        exploring and inspecting the alien creature, Jerry embarks on his first
        sexual experience. After numerous encounters between Jerry and the
        creature, it becomes pregnant. Filled with panic and guilt, Jerry
        attempts to abort the alien creature, leading to a horrific outcome
        which neither himself nor his mother will ever forget.</image:caption
