        >With a new partner and a quiet life in the suburbs, Jared finds himself
        tackling new obstacles. How does he live his life as a dignified gay man
        in a society that does not consider him equal? And how will he handle
        his partner's constant need to censor any public affection? One horrific
        event forces them both to figure it out. The finale piece of the Curious
        Thing trilogy, 'A Lack of Gravity' explores homophobia, activism and gay
        rights in America. Continuing in the series' format, documentary audio
        of gay men discussing their experiences with homophobia acts as the
        film's narration.</image:caption
