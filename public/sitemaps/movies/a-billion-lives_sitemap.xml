        >In 20 years’ time, there will be nearly 1.6 billion smokers around the
        world. Approximately 70% of smokers want to quit. The United Nations’
        World Health Organisation expects a billion people will die prematurely
        from smoking this century. The products their doctors recommend are
        rarely effective and many are trapped. A new vapour technology was
        invented to give smokers a successful way to quit. But it was quickly
        demonised, and even banned in many countries. A perfect storm is brewing
        between smokers trying to quit, government regulators, and health
        charities funded by the powerful pharmaceutical industry. Director Aaron
        Biebert travelled across four continents interviewing doctors,
        scientists, and others working to save a billion lives. What he found
        was profound government failure, widespread corruption in the public
        health community and powerful subversion by big business.</image:caption
