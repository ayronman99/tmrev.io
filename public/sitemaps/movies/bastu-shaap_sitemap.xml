        >It is a love story which is based on the concept of Feng Shui and Vastu
        and revolves around five people who live in the same house. Kushal
        (Parambrata) and Timir (kaushik) are Vaastu practitioners. They have a
        brotherly relationship while working together. Arjum (Abir) is an
        ex-Army officer with a house in Darjeeling. Everybody in the house is
        unhappy and so he seeks of consulting for Vaastu and reach out to
        Kushal-Timir. In an accident Arjun had lost a leg and in the same
        accident and his sister Antara had lost his husband and son. Loosing his
        son, Antara wants to live with Arjun-Bonya's son. This create some
        tension between her and Bonya. Now Kushal and Bonya had an earlier flame
        so this is another angle in the story line.</image:caption
