        >Senada is 31 and she lives in Poljice neighborhood in Lukavac
        municipality with her partner and two daughters. She is pregnant with
        her third child for approximately five months. Since she didn’t have
        health insurance, she does not go to the doctor’s. When she started
        bleeding, she goes to the hospital. The doctor told Senada that she
        needs an emergency surgery and she needs to pay 500 EUR. Without a
        health insurance card and without money, Senada returns
        home.</image:caption
