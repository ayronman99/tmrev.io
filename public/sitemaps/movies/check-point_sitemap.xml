        >Port City North Carolina: During a routine camp out, a local vagrant
        discovers plans for an invasion in America. When he tries to notify the
        local Sheriff about his discovery, the Sheriff dismisses his claims and
        has him locked up for loitering. When the Sheriff notices odd
        interactions with other towns folk he begins to look into the vagrants'
        claim of a sleeper cell living amongst the locals within this small
        town. After evidence of a beheading is exposed, others begin to fear
        that the insurgents attack on hometown USA. Questions and tempers begin
        to rise. Why this little beach community with it's Norman Rockwell way
        of life? A town where everyone knows one another... or so they thought.
        When the truth is blind and justice seems lost, It will take an army of
        five unlikely heroes banding together to infiltrate the insurgents and
        foil their invasion plans.</image:caption
