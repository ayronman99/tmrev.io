        >Following nearly 40 years of unrelenting war, peace and reconstruction
        are slowly arriving to Angola. Huambo, Angola’s second largest city,
        finds 55 children in the Okutiuka orphanage under the care of Sonia
        Ferreira. Her boyfriend, Wilker Flores, is a death metal guitarist who
        uses sounds and rhythms of this hardcore music as a path to healing. Or,
        as Sonia says, “to clear out the debris from all these years of war.”
        The feature documentary follows Wilker and Sonia’s attempts to stage
        Angola’s first-ever national rock concert, bringing together members
        from different strands of the Angolan hardcore scene from different
        provinces, as it all unfolds in fits and starts, against the bombed out
        and mined backdrop of the formerly stately Huambo.</image:caption
