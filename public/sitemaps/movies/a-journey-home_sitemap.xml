        >Dante, a middle-aged man, believes he has lost everything: estranged
        from his family for twenty years, he losses his job and finds out that
        his wife is dead. He goes to her wake and sees his two children Raffy
        and Kristine again. While Dante is eager to make amends with them, Raffy
        does not want him back into his life. When an accident forces Raffy to
        take Dante into his house, Dante learns how his own failure as a father
        has made an impact on how his son acts as the head of his family. In his
        effort to make things right between himself and Raffy, Dante develops a
        bond with Raffy's wife Gayle and his grandkids, Jake and Tinka. Dante
        rediscovers his love for music that Raffy's son is also passionate
        about. With his growing relationship with Raffy's family, Dante begins
        to glimpse some hope for a second chance. F or how long can Raffy harden
        his heart? Will Dante finally get his second chance at
        happiness?</image:caption
