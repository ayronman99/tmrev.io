        join Farmer John on a fascinating trip to Old McDonald’s farm. You’ll

        huge rolls of hay and a combine that can separate corn kernels from the
        cob in only minutes! Step inside the barn and watch a modern milking
        machine go to work on some friendly cows. Find out how horses get their
        shoes... collect eggs from the chicken coop...help feed some hungry
        goats...and watch two muddy pigs playing in hog heaven. HORSES From
        sleek thoroughbreds to powerful, towering draft horses and cute ‘n’
        cuddly ponies, these special animals have so much to offer. Horses A–Z

        designed for the budding rider, future rodeo star, or simply anybody who
