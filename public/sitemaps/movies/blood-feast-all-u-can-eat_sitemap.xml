        >Fuad Ramses III (J.P. Delahoussaye) returns to Miami to reopen his
        grandfather's defunct catering company. This arouses the interest of the
        local sheriff (Mark McLachlan), who holds Fuad's family reputation in
        ill favor. Fuad is soon, however, asked to cater the sheriff's wedding
        by his mother-in-law, Mrs. Lamply (Melissa Morgan), and fiancee, Tiffani
        (Toni Winne). After finding his grandfather's statue of Ishtar, an
        Egyptian goddess, in a utility closet, he becomes possessed by her evil
        spirit. He then goes on to create the 'blood feast' his grandfather
        failed to do, by killing young women in the area and making them into
        party food for the wedding.</image:caption
