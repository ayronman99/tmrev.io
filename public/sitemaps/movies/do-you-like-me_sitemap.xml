        >Nati (17) lives with her parents and her brother Seba in a marginal
        neighborhood. Nati and Seba do the deliveries for their mother’s canteen
        and spend time with a group of friends who make a living committing
        minor crimes. When Nati discovers that her parents have a debt they
        cannot pay, she tries to join the gang to get the money. During the
        robbery to a restaurant, Nati disobeys the gang leader and puts the plan
        in danger. With the collaboration of his men, the chief rapes Nati as
        punishment for her ‘rebellious’ attitude. Seba manages to find her, but
        Nati is furious and –in revenge– she decides to kill them one by
        one.</image:caption
