        >Billy Joe Shaver is the quintessential country songwriter, but that s
        just a big word that doesn't do justice to the honest, raw intensity and
        outpouring of heart and soul in his lyrics. Over 50 artists have
        recorded his songs, but nobody does it better than Billy Joe, and that s
        why this show is so important. Recorded on August 14, 1984, Billy Joe
        holds back nothing. There s the grit, there s the attitude, there s the
        defiance. But there s also the intimacy, the poetry, the
        stories.</image:caption
