        >Set on a game reserve in Africa. Askari is an angry old elephant, the
        only survivor of the "A' family group which has been anhilitated in a
        government cull and he has turned rogue. Involved in the culling are
        Patrick Khumalo, a corrupt government official and Ribshaw, an
        unscrupulous white poacher accompanied by Ndhlovu, an old African
        tracker who is being blackmailed by Ribshaw. Anxious to save the
        elephants are game warden Joss Mckinley and his conservationist wife
        Paula who is studying and monitoring various family groups of elephants.
        When Paula's sixteen year old niece Emma Crawshay is orphaned she is
        sent to live with her aunt and uncle at Morena Game Park. She feels
        alienated but is gradually drawn into her aunt's passion for her work
        and her favourite elephant family the 'O' group, in particular a calf
        named Ollie.</image:caption
