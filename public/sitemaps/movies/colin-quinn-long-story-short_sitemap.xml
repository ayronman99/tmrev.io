        >In LONG STORY SHORT, Colin Quinn focuses his articulate brand of comedy
        on the demise of empires, including our own. More than standup comedy,
        LONG STORY SHORT is a hilarious blend of incisive observation, sharp
        commentary, and Colin's channeling of the personalities of the past.
        From Socrates to Snooki, Quinn is at his satirical best, taking on the
        attitudes, appetites and bad habits that toppled the world's most
        powerful nations. Long Story Short proves that throughout human history,
        the joke has always been on us.</image:caption
