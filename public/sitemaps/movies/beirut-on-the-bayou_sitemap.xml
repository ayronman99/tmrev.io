        >Lebanese author, Raif Shwayri, travels to Louisiana to trace the life
        of his grandfather who once worked as a peddler serving the Cajuns on
        Bayou Lafourche. Alfred “Sweet Papa” Nicola spent nearly two decades, in
        the early 20th century, selling his wares to the French-speaking melting
        pot that was developing on the edge of civilization. His years of
        traveling to these isolated villages would eventually, and surprisingly,
        lead to substantial aid for tens of thousands of disabled and
        impoverished children in Lebanon. This film celebrates the rarely told
        story of early Arab-American immigrants and includes never-before-seen
        16mm footage of South Louisiana and Beirut from the 1950s. It also
        includes rare photos of early Cajun life as well as an original Arabic
        score and a cover of a Cajun classic using Arabic
        instruments.</image:caption
