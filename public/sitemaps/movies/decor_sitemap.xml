        >Maha has always been passionate about cinema, and as a set designer
        she's become an expert at creating imaginary worlds. Under immense
        pressure at work, she sights another life on the horizon and begins
        slipping between realities-one resembling the film set she's designed
        and the other her supposed real life. As she grows ever more entangled
        in each, the border between reality and imagination becomes blurred, and
        she must choose for the first time what she truly
        desires.</image:caption
