        >Police inspector Sciarra, struggling with an identity crisis, and
        Domenica, an orphan who would like to know about her mother, spend one
        day together along the streets of Naples. It's Sciarra's last day of
        work and he has to take Domenica to the morgue, to identify a man who
        might have raped her. To Domenica, Sciarra is a father she never had, to
        him she is the daughter he couldn't have.</image:caption
