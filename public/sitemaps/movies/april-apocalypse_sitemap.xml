        >Artie is pure bred trailer trash. He has zero ambition, is everyone's
        favorite punching back at school and bears the burden of his virginity
        in silence. And then April moves out of the state. She's his best friend
        and support since kindergarten and the love of his life. Three years
        later Artie finally has the courage to take to the road and go see April
        to tell her how he feels about her. One car-crash later Artie wakes up
        in the middle of the zombie apocalypse. But this time he's not going to
        hide. Artie's love for April doesn't give him wings, but does give him
        the courage to hack, slash, punch and kick himself a part towards the
        girl he loves. Time is of the essence, because that bite on his hand
        will make the difference between a French kiss and a bite out of April's
        brains.</image:caption
