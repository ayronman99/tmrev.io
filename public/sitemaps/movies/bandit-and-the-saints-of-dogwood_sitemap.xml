        >Lenna, her furry best friend Bandit, and a few other students plan to
        pull a prank on the Principal the last day of school...The night of
        their dastardly deed, they encounter treasure map toting thieves looking
        for gold buried underneath the school's gym. The students are discovered
        by the thieves and barely escape and they are blamed by the principal
        for the damage. Bandit recruits a few of his own four legged pals to
        help the kids and lead them home.</image:caption
