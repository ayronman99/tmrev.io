        >50 Years of Fabulous recounts the rich history of the Imperial Council,
        the oldest LGBT charity organization in the world. Founded in San
        Francisco by renown activist, drag queen and performer Jose Sarria, the
        Council has helped shaped LGBT life and social history in San Francisco
        and beyond throughout the last five decades. Sarria was also the first
        openly gay man to run for political office in the United States in 1961.
        From its genesis as a critical public space for the community and
        capacity building of LGBT San Franciscans, to its vital role in the
        advocacy for LGBT human rights, 50 YEARS OF FABULOUS documents the full
        scope of the organizationâ€™s historical evolution up to its contemporary
        struggle in finding relevance -- both in the wake of social progress it
        has helped foster, and in light of a newly empowered political coalition
        committed to rolling back a half-century of civil rights
        achievements.</image:caption
