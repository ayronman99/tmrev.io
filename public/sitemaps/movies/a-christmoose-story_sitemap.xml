        >Based on the best-selling novel, A CHRISTMOOSE STORY brings to life the
        tale of an unlikely friendship between a young boy and a large, talking
        moose. Young Max has low expectations for his first Christmas after his
        parents’ divorce, when suddenly a large moose crashes through the roof
        of his garage. And if that isn’t strange enough, the moose claims to
        have fallen from Santa’s sleigh! But being friends with a moose isn’t
        all that simple. Especially since Max’s grumpy neighbor has no interest
        in hanging stockings for Christmas but would love to hang up a pair of
        moose antlers, and Santa is out there somewhere looking to get his
        sleigh back!</image:caption
