        >Vanessa, a documentary filmmaker, and she is making a film about
        folklore. Her best friend Brad was meant to help her, but he instead
        decides to go on a date with new love Jessica, who he met online. His
        new girlfriend persuades Vanessa to join him by telling her the house is
        haunted and would be a good subject for her film, but it turns out she
        has been lured into a trap and she is a creature from Hell. Quite how
        she will be impregnated by a female demon will be revealed in the
        movie.</image:caption
