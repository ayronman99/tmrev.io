        >Filmed over three years, the documentary is an unprecedented record of
        a major artist at work. It captures David Hockney's return to England
        after 25 years in California. As he approaches the age of 70, he decides
        to re-invent his painting from scratch, working through the seasons and
        in all weathers out in the Yorkshire countryside - ending up with the
        largest picture ever made outdoors. It is at once the story of a
        homecoming and an intimate portrait of what inspires and motivates
        today's greatest living British-born artist as time runs out. Winner of
        Best Essay award at the International Festival for Films on Art in
        Montreal and nominated Best Arts Documentary by the Grierson and
        International Emmy Awards. Premiered on BBC1, the documentary appears in
        a special extended 60' version.</image:caption
