        >Loneliness, saving face, and public mores. In 1983 in China, Yun is a
        bright schoolgirl who gets pregnant. She's expelled, her boyfriend
        leaves town, and her mother arranges the baby's adoption, telling Yun
        the child died at birth. Ten years later, Yun sings pop songs in a dive,
        takes the occasional married lover, and lives with her mother, a
        teacher. The mother tutors a student, Xiao-yong, a lad of ten, who
        becomes attached to Yun. Yun's mother discovers who the boy's really is
        and a struggle begins. Should he be told; should Yun reclaim him; does
        her mother's opinion matter; what about the woman who's raised him? Is
        there room in a Chinese town for a woman to breathe?</image:caption
