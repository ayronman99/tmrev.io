        >Derek Jarman's family, friends and closest collaborators recall the
        life and genius of one of Briatin's greatest film-makers - featuring
        clips, stills and a gorgeous use of Super 8. "Understand that your
        morality is not law," said Derek Jarman. A good maxim for a filmmaker
        whose life and work is explored in this loving documentary. Avant-garde
        in method but nostalgic in temperament, he's remembered by family and
        friends like Tilda Swinton and Nigel Terry. Excellent use of Super 8
        blends with revelatory stories, not least his wish to cast Terry-Thomas
        as Ariel in The Tempest!</image:caption
