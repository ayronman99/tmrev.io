        >Laura manages to escape from dangerous old gangster Don Fabiano and his
        crew. With a motorcycle and a bag filled with money and weapons, she
        hits the road leaving her obscure past behind. Her escape route ends up
        at a farm house in the middle of nowhere, were she will meet a shady
        local family, a little girl Julie, her mother Eli and her tormented
        father Richie. Laura thinks she has left her past behind, but her past
        has not left her yet and soon various assassins will arrive to the house
        as Laura and her new family will have to survive the
        attacks.</image:caption
