        >Trecartin describes (Tommy-Chat Just E-mailed Me.) as a "narrative
        video short that takes place inside and outside of an e-mail."
        Trecartin's intense visualization of electronic communication is
        inhabited by a cast of stylized characters: Pam, a lesbian librarian
        with a screaming baby in an ultra-modern hotel room; Tammy and Beth, who
        live in an apartment filled with installation art; and Tommy, who is
        seen in a secluded lake house in the woods. Pam, Tommy and Tammy are all
        played by Trecartin, who, wearing his signature make-up, jumps back and
        forth between male and female roles. Totally self-absorbed and equipped
        with vestigial attention spans, the characters are constantly
        communicating with one another on the phone or online.</image:caption
