        >Finally, the wait is over. Billy Connolly, the King of Comedy, returns
        in his first brand new stand up DVD for three years. As funny, topical
        and downright brilliant as ever, Billy Connolly Live in London 2010 is
        the master at his best. From raging about Britain’s political elite to
        reporting about the oddities of America, Live in London 2010 takes the
        audience on a hilarious series of anecdotes, digressions and yarns.
        Filmed this year during 20 sell-out nights at London’s Hammersmith
        Apollo, this is the show that caused a ticket website to crash from the
        demand when it first went on sale.</image:caption
