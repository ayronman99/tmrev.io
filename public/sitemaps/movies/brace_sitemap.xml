        >On his first foray out onto London's thriving gay scene, newly single
        Adam meets Rocky, a handsome and mysterious drifter, with whom he shares
        an instant and undeniable chemistry. From the outset, Rocky is eager to
        reveal more of himself than Adam is ready for, and so the two maintain
        an uncomfortable pact of silence. As the pair grow closer, something has
        to give, and the truth about Rocky is explosively revealed. As the dust
        settles, the men are left to decide whether they can find acceptance in
        each other, by facing the truth about themselves.</image:caption
