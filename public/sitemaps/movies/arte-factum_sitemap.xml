        >After traveling across a wasteland of pestilence and famine in search
        of a mysterious object, a lone woman (Rachel Miller) finds refuge at
        Seven Bowls Tavern. It becomes apparent after sharing some drinks with a
        shadowy figure (Krys Bailey) that her arrival was not mere chance. As
        his stories about the Arte Factum unfold and draw her in, her presence
        at the tavern begins to attract the horsemen. One by one they ride in
        and fill Seven Bowls until she decides it’s time to bid them all adios.
        Wages of Cine presents an anthology of twelve tales that transverse
        space and time following a mysterious object known as the “Arte
        Factum”.</image:caption
