        >Somewhere in the middle of Texas, Ameet (Sunil Malhotra) and Saima
        (Lisa Ray) have a problem. They were perfectly happy avoiding each other
        until their parents set them up to get married. The reluctant couple
        decide to do whatever it takes to break off the engagement. After some
        very embarrassing efforts, they finally succeed in getting their parents
        to call off the wedding, only to realize they have another problem,
        they're in love! Meanwhile, Saima's father (Asrani), deciding that she's
        passed her expiration date, promises her to Ashol (Ismail Bashey)- a
        sleazy playboy.</image:caption
