        >When a young boy makes a wish at a carnival machine to be bigâ€”he wakes
        up the following morning to find that it has been granted and his body
        has grown older overnight. But he is still the same 13-year-old boy
        inside. Now he must learn how to cope with the unfamiliar world of
        grown-ups including getting a job and having his first romantic
        encounter with a woman.</image:caption
