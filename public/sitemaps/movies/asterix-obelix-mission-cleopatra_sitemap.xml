        >The Egyptian Queen Cleopatra bets against the Roman Emperor, Julius
        Caesar, that her people are still great, even if the times of the
        Pharaohs has long passed. She vows (against all logic) to build a new
        palace for Caesar within three months. Since all her architects are
        either busy otherwise or too conservative in style, this ambivalent
        honor falls to Edifis. He is to build the palace and be covered in gold
        or, if not, his fate is to be eaten by crocodiles. Edifis calls upon an
        old friend to help him out: The fabulous Druid Getafix from Gaul, who
        brews a fantastic potion that gives supernatural strength. In order to
        help and protect the old Druid, Asterix and Obelix accompany him on his
        journey to Egypt. When Julius Caesar gets wind of the project
        succeeding, he has the building site attacked by his troops in order to
        win the bet and not lose face. But just like the local pirates, he
        hasn't counted on Asterix and Obelix.</image:caption
