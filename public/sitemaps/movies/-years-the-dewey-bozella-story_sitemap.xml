        >Dewey Bozella’s life changed forever when he was sentenced to 20 years
        to life in prison for a murder he did not commit. Throughout his 26
        years behind bars, Bozella found strength and purpose through boxing,
        becoming the light heavyweight champion of Sing Sing Prison, and made it
        a goal to be proven innocent and box professionally once he was
        released. ESPN Films chronicles Bozella’s journey from prison cell to
        professional boxer.</image:caption
