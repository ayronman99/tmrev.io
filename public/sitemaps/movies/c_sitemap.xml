        >"Prototype #31: C404.40.40.31" is a 31-minute audio/video DVD that fits
        animated graphics layered on video and TV footage to a 31-minute
        original audio track. The video is composed of segments designed by
        Yoshi Sodeoka and invited artists that respond in different ways to the
        underlying audio track. The project was originally shown as an
        installation at "Digital Dumbo," a four-day festival held in September
        2001, which was devoted to showcasing new digital art.</image:caption
