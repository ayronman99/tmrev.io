        >Giordano, an angel assigned to an orphan in Krakow, is two years into
        the job when his celestial overseers, citing budget cuts, initiate
        "Phase Two" without telling him. Some changes are good - they send him a
        nanny, the enterprising Irena; some are bad - his phone number to Heaven
        no longer works nor do his special powers; and some dismay him - he
        grows a penis. His closest friend tells him to get a woman, and Irena
        advises him on hygiene. He visits a therapist, Roma, and falls in love
        with her. She tells him its transference. Meanwhile, Giordano's
        celestial friends conspire to rid Roma of her boyfriend, clearing the
        way for Giordano to be his naive and engaging self.</image:caption
