        >Made in Amsterdam in 2011. You see the image of an Urban Landscape. The
        camera work is taken in one shot from a static position, the moving
        parts of the film are the clouds, the smoke, the birds and the moving
        trees in the wind. The smoke clouds are from of the coal-fired power
        station Hemweg Centrale. It is closed since the end of december in 2019.
        The narration is from Defoe's "The Life and Strange Surprsing Adventures
        of Robinson Crusoe", written in 1719. The text is an excerpt from page
        47: (..) We knew nothing where we were, or what country were we driven
        to, be it an island or the main, inhabited or uninhabited (..) The film
        is made from a visionary view of the landscape that has changed over
        time. And not knowing where we have ended up in this world. Clouds are
        formed by smoke, we can no longer tell the difference. The film touches
        on subjects such as the makeable world, time, change, industrialization,
        the ignorance of humans and the preservation of nature.</image:caption
