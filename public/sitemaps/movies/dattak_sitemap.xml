        >When the Indian-born Sunil (Rajit Kapoor) stops getting letters from
        his father back home, he takes a break from his lucrative corporate gig
        in the States and pays dad a visit. But once in Calcutta, Sunil learns
        that his father moved away a few years earlier, prompting Sunil to go
        searching for him. As he follows the scant trail, Sunil starts to
        understand that his selfish lifestyle bore grave consequences for his
        father.</image:caption
