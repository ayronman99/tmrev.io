        >Veterans of World War II describe their experiences of the retreat to
        Dunkirk in 1940 and the evacuation. On 10 May, the German Army invaded
        Holland and Belgium. The Blitzkrieg had begun, an entirely new way of
        fighting war. For the young men aged 18 and 19 who joined up to 'do
        their bit', it was a terrifying baptism of fire, and for the British
        Army a shattering blow. Within three weeks, it was a crushing defeat,
        leading to the largest military evacuation in history. This film is the
        story, told in their own words, of a group of young men, now veterans,
        and their first experience of modern mechanised warfare.</image:caption
