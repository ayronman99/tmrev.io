        >40 years after the original version of Apocalypse Now was released,
        Francis Ford Coppola decided not only to oversee a brand-new restoration
        of the film but also to create a brand-new cut. The Apocalypse Now final
        cut came out in 2019 and was a significant improvement of Apocalypse Now
        Redux. Much as he'd reversed a big mistake forty years earlier when he
        fired original Apocalypse Now star Harvey Keitel, Coppola took in the
        criticisms of the Redux version and crafted a new version that trimmed
        back many of the added scenes or cut them out again entirely. This cut
        paid much more attention to the ecology of the film and works much
        better than Redux. What was even more exciting about Apocalypse Now:
        Final Cut was that the new 4k transfer was made from the original film
        negative rather than the interpositive used in all previous transfers of
        the film, so the final cut is definitely the best-looking of all the
        versions and is the one that Coppola himself is most proud
        of.</image:caption
