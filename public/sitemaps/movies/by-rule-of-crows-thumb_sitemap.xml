        >Constantly on the run from a vicious loan shark, two small-time con
        artists, Take and Tetsu, plan their biggest and most complex con yet in
        order to get revenge and retire from a life of crime. However, things
        get complicated when they cross paths with Mahiro, a young woman that
        Take inadvertently orphaned during a job gone awry years ago. Seeing
        Mahiro down on her luck, Take tries to relieve his guilt by taking her
        on as a partner, while hiding his true identity. But as his plan
        unfolds, Take discovers that he isn't the only one with a
        secret.</image:caption
