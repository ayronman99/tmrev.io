        >After the tragic death of his wife and child, famed American author
        Joseph Crone travels from the United States to Barcelona, Spain, to
        reunite with his estranged brother Samuel and dying father, Richard.
        However, fate has a different plan for Joseph as his life becomes
        plagued with strange happenings, and the constant sightings of the
        number 11. Curiosity quickly turns to obsession, and Joseph soon
        realizes that this number holds a horrific meaning not only to himself
        but possibly to all of religion. Isolated in a foreign country with only
        the support of his companion, Sadie, Joseph soon realizes that 11-11-11
        is more than just a date, it's a WARNING!</image:caption
