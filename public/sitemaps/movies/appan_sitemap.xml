        >A cruel womaniser, who cheated death and has been bedridden for ages,
        harasses his wife and son out of spite. As his family waits for him to
        die, the villagers form a mob demanding to kill him because of his
        actions. When he tricks his wife into allowing him to spend time alone
        with another woman, his family faces a hard decision that could alter
        their lives forever.</image:caption
