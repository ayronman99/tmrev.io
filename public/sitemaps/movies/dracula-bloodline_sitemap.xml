        >American psychologist, Dr. Lesley Parker, is in Paris studying
        techniques with the aim of using hypnotism to treat phobias resulting
        from repressed childhood trauma. Her plans are interrupted when she
        meets Val Drakul, whose ancient ancestor was Dracula. His recurring
        blackouts coincide with recent grisly murders and is convinced that he
        is the nocturnal culprit, having fallen victim to the family curse.
        Intent on disproving Val's theory, Lesley brings him back to California
        making him part of a new group of patients suffering from phobias. But
        when the patients start dying one by one, questions arise as to whether
        Val is the vampire after all.</image:caption
