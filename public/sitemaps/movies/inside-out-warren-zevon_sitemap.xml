        >This documentary follows singer-songwriter Warren Zevon through his
        struggle with the cancer that would later kill him in 2003. Despite his
        debilitating disease, Zevon worked feverishly to complete his emotional
        final album, "The Wind." The creation of this album was an amazing
        endeavor that's also chronicled here. Hosted by Billy Bob Thornton, the
        program features interviews with Jackson Browne, Stevie Nicks and Mick
        Fleetwood, among others.</image:caption
