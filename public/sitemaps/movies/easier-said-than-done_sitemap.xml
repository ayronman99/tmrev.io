        >Easier Said Than Done explores the ultimate motorsport - rallying.
        Following an international cast of characters including top drivers,
        mechanics and co-drivers from around the world. The film focuses on
        young three time U.S champion Chris Duplessis while he makes an attempt
        to reach the top level of the sport, the World Rally Championship.
        Rallying is extremely difficult. It's expensive, dirty, rough and one of
        the last pure motorsports in the world.</image:caption
