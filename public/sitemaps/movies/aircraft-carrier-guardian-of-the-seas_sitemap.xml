        >The mission to protect and defend the world's oceans has become far
        more complex and challenging in recent years, and naval aviation has
        become increasingly vital to success. One of the greatest engineering
        feats in history, the modern U.S. nuclear carrier is a masterpiece of
        technology, and the flagship of the fleet. With RIMPAC, the world’s
        largest and most comprehensive international maritime training exercise
        providing a stunning visual context for the story, find yourself aboard
        the carrier alongside the 5,000 highly skilled sea and air personnel
        conducting flight operations in the midst of the simulated war exercises
        taking place there. Rarely has there been a topic so visually suited and
        compelling for IMAX® and other giant screen theaters.</image:caption
