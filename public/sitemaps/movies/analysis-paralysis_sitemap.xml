        >The story begins when Tyler O'Conner, a young gay author, visits a
        therapist and discovers that he suffers from an anxiety disorder
        commonly called "Analysis Paralysis" - an inability to take action
        without imagining the ways that each possible choice could go wrong. The
        problem is that, unchecked, the condition will lead Tyler into a state
        of complete inaction. To confront the disorder, Tyler decides to fight
        through his anxiety and ask his cute neighbor, Shane, out for coffee.
        Despite a flurry of imagined disasters, the date goes well, and Shane
        and Tyler ultimately become involved. Against all odds, the relationship
        moves forward, but not without every step of the way - sex, moving in
        together, and meeting Shane's parents - preceded by an avalanche of
        negative, albeit hilarious, fantasies.</image:caption
