        >Following the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, hundreds of thousands
        refugees took the perilous escape route across South China Sea to find
        freedom. Many died of drowning or starvation and thirst. Others were
        lost at sea, or robbed and killed by pirates. More than 30 years later,
        no major film or television program has told their stories. Bolinao 52
        presents this long-silenced voice, an unspoken legacy of the Vietnam
        War. Filmmaker Duc Nguyen, also a boat refugee, retraces the odyssey of
        Bolinao 52 – a vessel adrift on the sea for 37 days—and a survivor Tung
        Trinh as she returns to her past to tell her story.</image:caption
