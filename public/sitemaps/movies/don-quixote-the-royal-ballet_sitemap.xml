        >Carlos Acosta's first venture directing one of ballet's 19th century
        classics was eagerly anticipated, as was his own starring role in the
        production (as Basilio), opposite the Argentinian Royal Ballet principal
        Marianella Nuñez (Kitri). Still built on Petipa's original choreography,
        Acosta's clear dramatic structure and vivid stage action gave the ‘boy
        gets girl despite her father’ story a more convincing air than usual,
        with Don Quixote's parallel obsession with Dulcinea-Kitri coherently
        woven into the plot.</image:caption
