        >Steven Cantor's award-winning documentary chronicles of the lives of
        bouncers - the burly boys who guard both sides of the door in nightclubs
        across America. The film takes an inside look at the mindset of these
        frequently ridiculed, but always feared enforcers of the night and
        examines whether they are skilled experts in security, hired to
        anticipate trouble, or just hired thugs meant to intimidate. Revealed
        within is a world of notorious nightclub bouncers, including New York's
        Terence "The Black Prince" Buckley and British legend Lenny "The
        Guv'nor" McLean who appeared in "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"
