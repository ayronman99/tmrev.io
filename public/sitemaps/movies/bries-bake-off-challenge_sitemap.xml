        >Brie Hayes is an aspiring baker who wishes to win her school's Spring
        Bake Off Challenge. Troubles ensue when Brie's confidence reaches an
        ultimate low and her "arch nemesis", Vanessa, does everything she can to
        slim Brie's chances of winning. Brie's family and her best friend Millie
        must help her gain perspective and practice to win. Stakes are high as
        these pre-teens compete for the grand prize of $5,000 and for four Cosmo
        Land tickets. This is the ultimate baking movie for children and adults
        who love watching cooking and baking shows.</image:caption
