        >Dujone has the college-going Meghna (Srabanti) and Akash (Dev) falling
        for each other. But with Meghna's dad being in the fish business as
        opposed to Dev's industrialist dad, objections are an obvious
        progression. Things get murkier and gory what with Akash's dad keeping
        him caged in Siliguri and Meghna's against-romance pishi (Seema) keeping
        a hawk's eye on her every move. And just when you thought you've seen
        the best of De's muscle flexing and Srabanti's desperation to meet
        Akash, in comes a contract killer (Arijit) employed by Akash's dad to
        finish off Meghna. As all action stories should end, Dujone too reaches
        a fitting finale with Meghna-Akash's love triumphing over all
        odds.</image:caption
