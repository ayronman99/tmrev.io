        >Reeling after her latest novel flops, best-selling crime writer Robin
        Richards (Andréa Winter) is sent by her publisher to the Swedish
        countryside to regain inspiration. There alone, she indeed comes across
        an assortment of peculiar characters, including her driver and most
        obsessive fan, his explosively jealous wife, and the progressively more
        unhinged man who owns the farm that’s hosting her. Totally out of place
        in her new surroundings—for one, she is always dressed for glamorous,
        big-city life—Robin discovers just how dangerous these oddballs may be.
        The unpredictable debut feature by Patrick von Barkenberg (who also
        appears as Robin’s boyfriend) is bathed in dreamy atmospherics and
        streaked with offbeat humor, but remains grounded throughout by Winter,
        who holds your attention rapt.</image:caption
