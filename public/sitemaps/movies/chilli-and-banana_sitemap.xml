        >Do-jin is a poor self-employed man who acts as an errand boy for his
        big brothers. He falls in love with Eun-ha at first sight when he first
        saw her at the camping site where he went to play with his seniors.
        Do-jin gets a part-time job as a massage therapist to pay the overdue
        rent. On the day he visited the mansion, Dojin found out that Eun-ha is
        living with a foreign professor. Eun-ha sends a signal to rescue her
        from being secretly held as a sex slave.</image:caption
