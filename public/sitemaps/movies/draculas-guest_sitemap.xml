        >Based upon Bram Stoker's short stories, Dracula's Guest follows the
        story of two young lovers, Bram and Elizabeth, who are forced by her
        father, the Admiral Murray, to take a one year probation from their
        relationship in order to determine whether their love is true.
        Meanwhile, the Count Dracula is in London searching for a new home and
        coincidentally, or not, comes across young Elizabeth at the train
        station after she's run away from home and her father's overbearing
        ways. Dracula, though, proceeds to kidnap her and take Elizabeth to his
        castle where he waits for her father's arrival to settle an ancient
        dispute. Meanwhile, Bram' friend Malcolm sets out to inform Bram of
        Elizabeth' kidnapping but he soon falls to Dracula's evil ways. And,
        upon finding his best friend dead Bram sets out across Europe to rescue
        his true love.</image:caption
