        >In the second half of the 19th century, Eadweard Muybridge, the father
        of motion pictures, embarks on an obsessive project to record on film
        "the motion of life" in all of its abundance. His epic quest is eclipsed
        only by the depth of his jealousy over his beautiful, young wife Flora.
        As the project progresses, his paranoia over her fidelity consumes him,
        until questions arise about his sonâ€™s paternity, causing him to
        erupt.</image:caption
