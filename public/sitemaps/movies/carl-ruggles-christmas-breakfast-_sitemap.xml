        >In her earliest film, which has been newly transferred to video,
        Schneemann presents an abstracted portrait of the American composer Carl
        Ruggles, known for his irascible personality and finely-crafted atonal
        music. Ruggles is seen enjoying pie a la mode and ruminating on subjects
        ranging from Christmas to his incomplete opera The Sunken Bell. The
        hand-painted film stock heightens the impressionistic vitality of this
        snapshot of the 84-year-old composer, who is heard paraphrasing Freud:
        "Everything that you do is a matter of sex. That is the great passion of
        life."</image:caption
