        >Following a year in the life of James Sanchez, it's a story about a guy
        rapidly approaching thirty, who doesn't have a six-pack, full head of
        hair or a boyfriend. While his best friend Roxy, an
        actress-turned-activist, struggles with showing him there's life beyond
        the glitz of the disco ball, his other friend, Brandon, one of those gay
        boys comfortable in his own gay skin, works on getting James to at least
        talk to a boy. Feeling out of place in the world of circuit boys, caught
        between his Hispanic-American heritage and being gay, we watch James
        find his place in the world, realizing that life is in the journey, not
        the destination.</image:caption
