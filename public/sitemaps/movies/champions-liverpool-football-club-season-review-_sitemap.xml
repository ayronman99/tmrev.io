        >Liverpool FC - Champions! In 2020 the Reds finally lifted their 19th
        top-flight title and the club's first of the Premier League era. Jürgen
        Klopp's relentless team ended a three decade wait in the most emphatic
        fashion, notching numerous Premier League records along the way and
        winning the division by a massive 18 points. Amid all the joy on the
        pitch, sport and the football season were put starkly into perspective
        as the world went into lockdown in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
        Yet this was still a campaign for Reds' fans to savour, thanks to surely
        one of the greatest sides to call Anfield home. With the UEFA Super Cup
        and the FIFA Club World Cup also added to the Anfield trophy cabinet,
        2019-20 was a season that suggests Jürgen Klopp could be building a
        football dynasty to rival those of Liverpool FC's glorious
        past.</image:caption
