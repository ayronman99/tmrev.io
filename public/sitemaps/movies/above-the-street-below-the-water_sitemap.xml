        >This is the day when the lives of an intertwined group of people take a
        new direction. Everything they have taken for granted starts to change.
        While Anne and Ask's relationship succumbs to 'metal fatigue', Charlotte
        has to realise that her husband Carl may not be right for her. At the
        same time Bente has to decide if she is prepared to wait for ever for
        her lover, while her ex-husband Bj√∏rn must face the pain of finally
        letting Bente go. The characters and their children are twirled around
        in an ever-increasing drama which peaks during the opening night of
        Hamlet. Anne is on stage as Ophelia, and the question remains: to be or
        not be responsible for one's own happiness.</image:caption
