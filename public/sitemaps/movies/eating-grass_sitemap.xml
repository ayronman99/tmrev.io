        >Filmed in Karachi, Lahore, and London, Eating Grass comprises five
        overlapping narratives, each representing different emotional states
        experienced throughout the day that are marked by the Muslim tradition
        of the five daily prayers. The film’s title references a remark made by
        Pakistan’s Prime Minister. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in 1974 amid the nuclear
        arms race with India. He said his people would have their own nuclear
        weapon even if it meant “eating grass.”</image:caption
