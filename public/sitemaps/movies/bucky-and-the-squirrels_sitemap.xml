        >Back in 1968, Bucky and the Squirrels topped the charts with their
        dance hit 'Do the Squirrel.' Unfortunately, on their first promotional
        tour, the plane carrying the band crashed and disappeared somewhere in
        the Swiss Alps - never to be heard of again. That is until now, 50 years
        later, when the plane is discovered with the Squirrels still inside -
        frozen alive. Naturally, they're taken to a cryonics lab to be
        defrosted. Long Live the Squirrels!</image:caption
