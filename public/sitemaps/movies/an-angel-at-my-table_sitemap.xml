        >Based on the autobiographical work of New Zealand writer Janet Frame,
        this production depicts the author at various stage of her life.
        Afflicted with mental and emotional issues, Frame grows up in an
        impoverished family and experiences numerous tragedies while still in
        her youth, including the deaths of two of her siblings. Portrayed as an
        adult by Kerry Fox, Frame finds acclaim for her writing while still in a
        mental institution, and her success helps her move on with her
        life.</image:caption
