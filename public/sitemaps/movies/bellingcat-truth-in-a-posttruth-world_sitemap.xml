        >A first-hand look into the revolutionary rise of the “citizen
        investigative journalist” collective known as Bellingcat. Comprised of
        various distinct personalities from around the globe, Bellingcat is an
        online association of talented and dedicated truth-seekers utilizing
        advanced digital research techniques to upend the world of journalism.
        De facto leader Eliot and his fellow researchers give us exclusive
        access into their tight-knit world as they demonstrate the unlimited
        power of open source investigation. In cases ranging from the MH17
        disaster to the hidden crimes of the Syrian regime, the group’s power
        and growing global influence is examined and explored.</image:caption
