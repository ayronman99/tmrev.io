        >Raquel is desperate: a series of unfortunate events have led to her
        daughter being taken and she needs a large amount of money to get her
        back, and fast. After a desperate plea to the bank, she manages to
        secure the loan she needs. The problem is that precisely at that moment,
        a peculiar couple of robbers enter the branch: the drug-addicted Jonan
        and his partner Lola, who is a deadly combination of smart and
        psychotic. But Raquelâ€™s stakes are too high, and she knows she must
        think carefully to outsmart them, save herself and get her
        money.</image:caption
