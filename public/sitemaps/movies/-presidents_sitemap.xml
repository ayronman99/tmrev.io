        >What is the common thread among the only four U.S. Presidents who have
        been assassinated - Lincoln, Garfield, McKinley, and Kennedy? They were
        also the only four presidents to ever to take away money-issuing control
        from the private banks and turn it over to the U.S. Treasury. Within
        less than a year of each president doing so, they were murdered. And
        within months of their vice president successors assuming their offices,
        they returned the money issuing power back to the private banks. 4
        PRESIDENTS provides the first-ever in depth analysis of this very likely
        - and very frightening - historic conspiracy.</image:caption
