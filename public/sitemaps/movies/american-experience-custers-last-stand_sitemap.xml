        >Follow General George Armstrong Custer from his memorable, wild charge
        at Gettysburg to his lonely, untimely death on the windswept Plains of
        the West. On June 26, 1876, Custer, a reputation for fearless and often
        reckless courage ordered his soldiers to drive back a large army of
        Lakota and Cheyenne warriors. By day's end, Custer and nearly a third of
        his army were dead.</image:caption
