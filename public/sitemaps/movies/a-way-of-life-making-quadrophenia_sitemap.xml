        >Two rival youth cults emerge - the mods and the rockers - with
        explosive consequences. For Jimmy (Phil Daniels) and his sharp-suited,
        pill-popping, scooter-riding mates, being a mod is a way of life, it's
        their generation. Together they head off to Brighton for an orgy of
        drugs, thrills, headline-making, and violent clashes with the rockers.
        Set to the music of The Who's seminal rock opera, Quadrophenia is still
        one of the most definitive films of its time, vividly capturing the
        youth culture of Britain in the 1960s. It's over 30 years since the film
        Quadrophenia hit the world's cinema screens. Jimmy the Mod's search for
        identity against the backdrop of the May Bank Holiday riots of the
        1960s, is regarded as the finest example of a British "youth" movie and
        a warmly remembered timepiece for a generation.</image:caption
