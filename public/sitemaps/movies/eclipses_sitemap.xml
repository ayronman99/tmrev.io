        >A woman begins to come to terms with society after having withdrawn
        into her own world to mourn her late husband. The film splinters away to
        document the characters surrounding her - people from different classes,
        including the director's own family. An investigation of the landscapes
        in which we live, work, and play, this is Singapore seen through the
        prisms of family, class and race.</image:caption
