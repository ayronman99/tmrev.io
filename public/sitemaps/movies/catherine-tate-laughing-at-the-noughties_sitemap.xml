        >Sketch-show sensation Catherine Tate tells the story of the decade in
        which she became a household name. She meets with comedy glitterati Alan
        Carr, David Walliams, Noel Fielding, Rob Brydon and her Doctor Who
        co-star, David Tennant, all of whom reflect on the greatest comedy
        moments in recent history. As well as showcasing all the most
        entertaining, memorable comedy of the time, the documentary also
        features newsreel and pop culture archive that contextualises the gags.
        It reveals not just what was funny, but why it was funny. Catherine's
        journey provides new insight and revelations and features anecdotes from
        some of the biggest names in comedy.</image:caption
