        >Detectives Jimmy and Paul, despite nine years as partners, can still
        sometimes seem like polar opposites—especially when Paul's unpredictable
        antics get them suspended without pay. Already strapped for cash and
        trying to pay for his daughter's wedding, Jimmy decides to sell a rare
        baseball card that's worth tens of thousands. Unfortunately, when the
        collector's shop is robbed and the card vanishes with the crook, Paul
        and Jimmy end up going rogue, tracking down the card and the drug ring
        behind its theft, all on their own time and without any backup—except
        for each other.</image:caption
