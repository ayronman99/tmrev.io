        >Damien is a pawn in a primary school, and leads a quiet life. To rescue
        one of his young students, Bahzad, and his mother from imminent
        expulsion from the land, Damien reconnects with his parents' militant

        solidarity. And very quickly to be completely exceeded.</image:caption
