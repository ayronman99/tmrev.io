        >A divorced taxi driver shows up with a black eye at the home of his
        ex-wife’s new family; he’s been invited to dinner and he desperately
        wants to reconnect with his young daughter. A professional magician’s
        car breaks down and he ends up spending an emotionally intense night
        with a young, widowed toll booth worker. A singer songwriter serving a
        lengthy prison sentence is released for one night to perform at a local
        community centre. These three deeply engaging stories about yearning for
        connection unfold in parallel, one New Year’s Eve in a small town in
        central Uruguay, balancing the universality of human suffering with a
        powerful sense of hope.</image:caption
