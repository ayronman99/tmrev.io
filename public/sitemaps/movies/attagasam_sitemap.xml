        >The movie begins with Ajith, a driving instructor leading a happy life
        with his mother Sujatha. She hides from him the truth that his father,
        Nizhalgal Ravi, was murdered by a dadha, Babu Anthony. The mother much
        against the boy’s wish packs off Ajith’s twin brother with a family who
        offer to adopt him, who had been witness to the murderer from a close
        quarter, to a distant town. He escapes from the family and goes to
        Tuticorin and grows to become a gangster there. When the younger Ajith
        visits Tuticorin, he comes across his elder brother. Seizing the
        opportunity, the elder brother kidnaps the younger one and decides to go
        as the driving instructor to Chennai. Initially, he plans to take
        revenge on his mother for packing him off from their house at a very
        young age. He hurts her at every step and even plans to sell off all
        their property.</image:caption
