        >Oleg is a young gifted paramedic. His wife Katya works as a nurse at
        the hospital emergency department. She loves Oleg, but is fed up with
        him caring more about patients than her. She tells him she wants a
        divorce. The new head of Oleg’s EMA department is a cold-hearted manager
        who’s got new strict rules to implement. Oleg couldn’t care less about
        the rules – he’s got lives to save; his attitude gets him in trouble
        with the new boss. The crisis at work coincides with the personal life
        crisis. Caught up between their patients, alcohol-fueled off-shifts, and
        an evolving health care system, Oleg and Katya have to find the binding
        force that will keep them together.</image:caption
