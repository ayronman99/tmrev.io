        >A Boy Named Sue chronicles the transformation of a transsexual named
        Theo from a woman to a man over the course of six years. Following
        Theo's physiological and psychological changes during the process, as
        well as their effects on his lesbian lover and community of close
        friends, A Boy Named Sue tells a story about gender identity,
        relationships, and how even things that seem permanent can
        change.</image:caption
