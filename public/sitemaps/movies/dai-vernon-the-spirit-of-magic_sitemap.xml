        >In addition to the insight provided by performers who knew Vernon,
        including Max Maven, Herb Zarrow, John Carney, Jackie Flosso, Ricky Jay,
        Steve Freeman and Persi Diaconis, it was an important opportunity for
        Vernon's children, Edward and Derek Verner, to share their own thoughts
        and feelings about their father, the magician. It also featured
        black-and-white silent footage of a younger Vernon demonstrating
        sleight-of-hand which we had converted and professionally retouched for
        the film. While the film was very well received, it was only available
        briefly for purchase as a VHS cassette, which was subsequently pirated.
        The film pops up regularly online, always low-quality copies of copies
        shared without any credit to those who made the project
        possible.</image:caption
