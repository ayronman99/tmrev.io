        >Melvin, a reluctant hero who is far from super, has been suppressing
        his telekinetic powers for years with booze, drugs, and women. In the
        process, he has failed at practically everything, most of all as a
        parent to his son. After a brush with death, Melvin decides to use his
        powers for good and clean up the streets of New Orleans with the help of
        his best friend/definitely-not-a-sidekick, Lucille. For a man who can do
        the impossible, it might be a fight even he canâ€™t win.</image:caption
