        >A brother and sister leave the big city to live with their veterinarian
        father when their mother is hospitalized. As they are adjusting to their
        new life filled with natural beauty, they adopt an abandoned puppy. When
        it is discovered that the puppy is actually a wolf, they choose to
        return the baby wolf to its mother in the forest rather than let it live
        a life in captivity.</image:caption
