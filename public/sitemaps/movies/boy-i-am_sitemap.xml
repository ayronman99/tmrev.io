        >While female-to-male transgender visibility has recently exploded in
        this country, conversations about trans issues in the lesbian community
        often run into resistance from the many queer women who view
        transitioning as a "trend" or as an anti-feminist act that taps into
        male privilege. Boy I Am is a feature-length documentary that begins to
        break down that barrier and promote dialogue about trans issues through
        a look at the experiences of three young transitioning FTMs in New York
        City--Nicco, Norie and Keegan--as they go through major junctures in
        their transitions, as well as through the voices of lesbians, activists
        and theorists who raise and address the questions that many people have
        but few openly discuss.</image:caption
