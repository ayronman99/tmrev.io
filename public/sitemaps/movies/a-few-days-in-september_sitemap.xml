        >1 September 2001. Elliot, an American C.I.A. agent holding top secret
        information on the immediate future of the world, disappears. His sole
        aim was to meet his daughter Orlando, whom he abandoned ten years
        before. Ir√®ne, a French agent who used to work with him, and David, his
        adoptive son, will help him and lead the girl to her father. Chased by
        William Pound, a strangely poetic psycho, they will defy the dangers of
        international espionage from Paris to Venice and finally get to Elliot
        on 11 September 2001.</image:caption
