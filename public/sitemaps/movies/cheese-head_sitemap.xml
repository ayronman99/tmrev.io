        >Lasting tradition clashes with new ideas in director Ariel Winograd's
        tale of a mischievous pre-adolescent whose family spends their summers
        basking in the comfortable surroundings of a picturesque Jewish country
        club. Ariel is a young boy whose family enjoys the high life. When
        summer rolls around his mother leads an Israeli dance class at the local
        Jewish country club, and his grandmother seems to have a special knack
        for always winning at rummy. His sister Natalia is rarely seen without
        roller skates lest she need to beat a hasty retreat from her overbearing
        suitor, and his brother David's hormones are raging like a white squall.
        As Ariel and his friends hop on their bikes and explore the grounds of
        the country club it feels as if life simply couldn't get any better, but
        sometimes life in this highly exclusive paradise isn't all it's cracked
        up to be.</image:caption
