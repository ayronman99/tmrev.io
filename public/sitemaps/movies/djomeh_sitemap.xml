        >Djomeh is a young Afghan man who has come to live in Iran because of
        family trouble. Working as a milk boy, he encounters discrimination from
        the Iranian villagers and disdain from Habib, a fellow Afghani to whose
        trust Djomeh was given. The only person who shows any friendliness to
        him is his employer, who Djomeh asks to intercede for him in asking a
        woman from the village for her hand in marriage.</image:caption
