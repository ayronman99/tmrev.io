        >Cons & Pros follows the story of two con artist women inspired by
        2019's media scam darlings Anna Delvey and Caroline Calloway. In order
        to pull off our con movie, we had to pull off a con ourselves: a piece
        of Heist Cinema, made by four people on a near zero dollar budget. To
        make the film we staged a marriage proposal at a luxury Toronto hotel
        and had our director/cinematographer pose as an "engagement
        videographer." Costumes were rented and returned from Saks Fifth Ave,
        and all props/art were courtesy of rich & generous (and lightly duped)
        strangers. The film was an exercise in how the process affects the
        product, whilst also exploring what we feel is our duty as millennial
        artists living on the outskirts of the oppressive Neoliberal torture
        factory. Cons & Pros is a big middle finger to the capitalist regime's
        promise of a luxury life that will never be ours. Making this film meant
        taking it without asking, and showing no mercy.</image:caption
