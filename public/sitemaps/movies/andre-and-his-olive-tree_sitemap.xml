        >Chef André Chiang is returning his Michelin stars, and has publicly
        declared that he is returning to his roots after 30 years. What would
        make him do so? How does the perfectionist define success? What haunts
        him at night? Following Chef André weeks before he officially closes his
        restaurant, we chart his emotional journey, and dive into nostalgic
        elements of his life. From how he first fell in love with cooking as a
        result of his mother’s influence, to the challenges that he faced when
        he first learnt cooking in France, we tell the story of a passionate and
        determined individual, now ready for the next season of his
        life.</image:caption
