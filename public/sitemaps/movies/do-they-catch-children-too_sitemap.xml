        >‘I was born here, so if they catch me, will I be forced to return?’
        This is the question asked by Ryan, a 10-year-old Filipino boy whose
        father is arrested for being an illegal alien in Israel. Nato is Ryan's
        cousin and best friend, and his father has a legal work permit.
        Together, the children live their seemingly normal everyday lives in the
        shadow of the constant fear of deportation. The film focuses on the
        children of foreign workers. In addition to a typical childhood
        existence, these children are forced to deal with a complex reality that
        includes tough questions as to their identity. The film follows the
        children's dreams, their games and their yearnings in a reality where
        the future is forever frightening and unknown.</image:caption
