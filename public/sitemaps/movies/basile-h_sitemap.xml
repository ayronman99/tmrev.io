        >When CEO Basile H. returns from a business trip, nothing can foil the
        growth of his success, so it seems. He is mentioned for a high-ranking
        position in Frankfurt, he has a well-to-do wife who waits for him and he
        lives in a beautiful residence in the woods. Then, his lawyer calls him
        with the announcement that a complaint has been filed against him by a
        waitress that he took to his hotel room the night before. Basile trusts
        he will win this time, too. But the dies are cast differently than he
        thinks.</image:caption
