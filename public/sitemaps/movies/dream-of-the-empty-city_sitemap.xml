        >An old man in hospice care tells his life story from beginning to end,
        of Peking Opera and singer Ma Lianliang, and of the humiliation and
        desperation of old age. Soon, the border between dreams and memories,
        reality and mental confusion become indistinct; the old man is slipping

        that disturbs his rest? Who is he? What kind of life did he
        lead?</image:caption
