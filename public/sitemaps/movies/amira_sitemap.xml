        >Amira, a 17 year old Palestinian, was conceived with the smuggled sperm
        of her imprisoned father, Nawar. Although their relationship since birth
        has been restricted to prison visits, he remains her hero. His absence
        in her life is overcompensated with love and affection from those
        surrounding her. But when a failed attempt to conceive another child
        reveals Nawar's infertility, Amira's world turns upside
        down.</image:caption
