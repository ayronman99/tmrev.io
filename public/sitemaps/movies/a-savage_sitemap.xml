        >A new screen version of the play of the same name, written by
        Aleksandar Ostrovski. After a long time spent traveling abroad, the
        aging landowner Aleksandar Ashmetev returns to his mansion. He soon
        informs his spouse Maria Petrova (whom he doesn't love) that intends to
        leave again for Paris, away from dull provincial life. In despair, Maria
        thinks up a cunning plan. She introduces Aleksandar to Varya Zubareva, a
        young beauty from the neighboring mansion, in the hope that she will
        keep him there for longer. But, the mock intrigue takes a serious turn
        when it becomes obvious that Aleksandar has become seriously interested
        in Varya. Aleksandar now begins to think about how he can turn his
        passion into a real romance with the young temptress.</image:caption
