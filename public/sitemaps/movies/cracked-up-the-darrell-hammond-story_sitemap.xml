        >In Cracked Up we witness the effects adverse childhood experiences can
        have across a lifetime through the incredible story of actor, comedian,
        master impressionist and Saturday Night Live veteran, Darrell Hammond.
        Behind the scenes Darrell suffered from debilitating flashbacks, self
        injury, addiction and misdiagnosis, until the right doctor isolated the
        key to unlocking the memories his brain kept locked away for over 50
        years. Cracked Up, director Michelle Esrick, creates an inspiring
        balance between comedy and tragedy helping us understand the impact of
        toxic stress and childhood trauma in a new light, breaking down barriers
        of stigma and replacing shame with compassion and hope.</image:caption
