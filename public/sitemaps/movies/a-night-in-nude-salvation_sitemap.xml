        >A beautiful mother and her two daughters run a bar in a town. They have
        a dream of becoming rich, reforming the building, and living as
        celebrities. With no chance of their dream coming true with just their
        everyday earnings, they had another face - blinding the elderly with
        their beauty, putting on insurance coverage and seeking to get rich
        quick by murdering. However, their scheme begins to collapse from one
        little mistake.</image:caption
