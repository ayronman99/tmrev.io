        >Seul-Gi and Ah-Reum are 3rd year students at the National High School
        of the Traditional Arts. They are also best friends. Seul-Gi majors in
        pansori (Korean traditional music) and Ah-Reum majors in Gyeonggi Folk
        Music. During their summer break, the girls struggle with pressures and
        anxiety. They then take a special summer school class due to a lack of
        attendance. Meanwhile, the Education Burea informs their school that
        they will take part in a chorus contest. The school selects Teacher Ham,
        a composer, to make up the school's chorus team. The pool consists of
        students from the special summer school class. A conflict also ensues
        between Ms. Ham, who majored in western music, and the students, who are
        majors in traditional Korean music. Can the students compete in the
        chorus performance?</image:caption
