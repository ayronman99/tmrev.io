        >The master of stupidity is back and this time he's on the road. Join
        Steve-O and his cohorts on a miraculous journey, destroying America one
        city at a time. The Steve-O Video - Volume 2 is loaded with as many
        stunts and pranks as the first, but it's even better. This amazing video
        chronicles the transformation of a group of unlikely television stars as
        they lose their innocence and establish the silliest legacy in the books
        of sex, drugs, and rock and roll history. It just doesn't get any dumber
        than this.</image:caption
