        >Megha Timghure, a plain-looking middle-class girl, lives with her mom,
        Laxmi, and dad, who is employed as an an Income Tax Officer. Her desire
        is to become a model and a beauty queen. At a party, she is
        mis-introduced as Sarika Verma, and meets with two eligible young men,
        Rizwan, and Varun Arya. She expresses desire in becoming a model and is
        referred to Almera Kochar, who has a reputation of bringing out the best
        in every model, and making them beauty queens. Almera meets with Sarika,
        and accepts her as a student, and makes her sign a contract. What Sarika
        does not know that she has now become a pawn in a devious plot concocted
        to protect millions gained by black marketing.</image:caption
