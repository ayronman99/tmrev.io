        >In his 2005 State of the Union address President George W. Bush cites
        Egypt as the country that will pave the way for democracy in the Middle
        East. Three women, unable to sit by while their country is on the brink
        of drastic change, start a grassroots movement to educate and empower
        the public by raising awareness about the meaning of democracy. They
        name their campaign Shayfeen.com, which means to “we are watching you.”
        This film follows the highs and lows of the first year of the movement
        in Egypt. Insisting that only the people can make change happen, their
        goal is to educate the Egyptian public on what it takes to build the
        most basic pillars of democracy: demanding basic human rights, freedom
        of speech and the establishment of an independent judiciary. Egypt: We
        are Watching You shows the role ordinary citizens can play in shaping
        and securing their democracy.</image:caption
