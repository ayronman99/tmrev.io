        >A bus called Sueños (Dreams) links three modern-day tales set in exotic
        Ecuador - the equator-straddling country that calls itself "The Middle
        of the World." Each of these stories carries a woman's name, and each
        features a mysterious, alluring female outsider who bewitches men. In
        the first tale, a blonde woman with an unclear past arrives in a remote,
        male-deprived Andean town and offers piano lessons, only to become the
        focus of wild rumors and innuendo. In the second, a married college
        professor who is haunted by nightmares becomes obsessed with a beguiling
        woman who seems to be sending him an ominous message. In the final
        story, a couple vacationing at a jungle resort refuse to believe in the
        ancient myths of Ecuador, but are forced to confront the legendary
        Guasangó.</image:caption
