        >Death Bed is an uncomplicated story about a complicated man who is just
        about at the end of his life. Stricken with a terminal illness, Jefferey
        is visited by his friends and family who try to reconnect with him
        before his inevitable end. Warm and reflective moments turn into course
        and combative exchanges between Jefferey and his loved ones. With him as
        the catalyst, Jefferey verbally and emotionally abuses his faithful
        girlfriend, oppressive mother, estranged sister, and even the visiting
        nurse who tends to him. When his mother brings Fr. Nicholas to see him
        'before it's too late', the ensuing chaos couldn't make things any worse
        . . . until Jefferey realizes that he is the only one who didn't know
        that he's dying.</image:caption
