        >In 1970, hundreds of hippies followed Stephen Gaskin on a journey from
        San Francisco to Tennessee, where they founded a legendary commune known
        as the Farm. Within this self-sustaining society based on non-violence,
        vegetarianism and respect for the earth, members willingly took a vow of
        poverty, lived in converted buses, grew their own food and
        home-delivered babies. Born and raised in this alternative community,
        filmmakers and sisters Rena and Nadine return for the first time since
        leaving in 1985. Finally ready to face the past after years of hiding
        their upbringing, they chart the rise and fall of Americaâ€™s largest
        utopian socialist experiment and their own family tree. The nascent
        idealism of a community destroyed, in part, by its own success is
        reflected in the personal story of a family unit split apart by
        differences. American Commune finds inspiration in failure, humour in
        deprivation and, most surprisingly, that communal values are alive and
        well in the next generation.</image:caption
