        >The continuing adventures of the barbers at Calvin's Barbershop. Gina,
        a stylist at the beauty shop next door, is now trying to cut in on his
        business. Calvin is again struggling to keep his father's shop and
        traditions alive--this time against urban developers looking to replace
        mom & pop establishments with name-brand chains. The world changes, but
        some things never go out of style--from current events and politics to
        relationships and love, you can still say anything you want at the
        barbershop.</image:caption
