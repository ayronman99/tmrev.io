        >After his mother unexpectedly dies, 17-year-old Ethan discovers he is
        the owner of his mother's horse - a horse he never even knew existed. He
        travels cross country to live with his grandparents and investigate the
        mystery. His grandmother is supportive but his angry grandfather Otto
        doesn't seem to want him around. Next door live three children who are
        taking riding lessons at the same farm where his mother's horse is
        boarded. Their lives intersect as Ethan deals with his grief over his
        mother's death and the children deal with a neighborhood bully whose
        father works at the horse farm. The journey for Ethan, Otto, the three
        children, the bully and her father all revolve around a gentle and
        faithful horse called Bear who deeply touches all their lives. This is a
        delightful redemption-themed family movie that will appeal to children,
        teens, horse-lovers and people of all ages.</image:caption
