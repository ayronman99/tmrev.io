        >Astolfo, a retired professor evicted from his apartment, decides to
        move into an old noble but decrepit palace, the last remnant of his
        family patrimony in a remote village of Abruzzo, where he hasn't been
        for decades. Soon enough, as a newcomer, he befriends a vagabond, a
        retired chef and a young handyman. A group of four live harmoniously at
        his place when he comes across Stefania, a charming and generous woman
        of his age. Astolfo falls in love and struggles with feelings he thought
        belonged to the past. Encouraged by his loyal group, Astolfo makes a
        brave step and learns delightedly that it's never too late to fall in
        love.</image:caption
