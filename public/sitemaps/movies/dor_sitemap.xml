        along with widowed paternal grandmother, Laxmibai, his mom, Gowri, and
        dad, Randhir. The family feel that they are blessed after Meera's entry
        in this family. Shankar must go and abroad in Saudi Arabia and bids
        farewell to Meera, promising to keep in touch, which he does, and also
        sends them a large portion of his earnings, which is used to pay off the
        family's debts. Then when no word is received from him, a worried Meera
        phones, and is devastated to learn that Shankar has been killed by being
        thrown off a 10th floor balcony. Her status quickly changes, her
        jewelery, ornaments, fancy clothes are taken off, and she is told to
        remain indoors. wear dark clothes, and is only allowed to pray at a
