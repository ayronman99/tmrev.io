        >Arianna is nineteen, but she's still waiting to get her first period.
        As the summer begins, her parents decide to renew their acquaintance
        with their country house on Lake Bolsena, where Arianna lived until she
        was three, and has never been back. As the family settle in for the
        summer, long-repressed memories start to re-emerge, and Arianna decides
        to stay on after her parents return to the city.</image:caption
