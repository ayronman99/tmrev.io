        >All Excess is Avenged Sevenfold's first DVD which was released on July
        17, 2007. The DVD includes a documentary with footage dating back to
        1999, four live performances, along with four music videos, and several
        out-takes. The DVD was created to portray how Avenged Sevenfold started
        in a unique way different from typical mainstream band DVDs. This was
        done by giving the viewer a look into the thoughts of, the relationships
        between, and the background of the band.</image:caption
