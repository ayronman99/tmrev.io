        >A rare and unique assembly of some of the greatest drummers in the
        world. Explosive talent, passion, humour and irresistible personality
        come together in a magical setting when seven diverse drummers create a
        profound and unforgettable experience. You've never seen drummers like
        this before! Featuring Nasyr Abdul Al-Khabyyr, Dennis Chambers, Kenwood
        Dennard, Horacio "El-Negro" Hernadez, Giovanni Hidalgo, Mike Mangini and
        Raul Rekow, the film engages us with the rich music styles and
        influences that are as dynamic as the performers themselves. We are
        lifted to another dimension as we connect to the powerful forces of
        nature embodied in the music of these master musicians. The creative and
        spiritual freedom of expression these artists display is overwhelming -
        from Latin rhythms to the wildly original compositions of Kenwood
        Dennard. Rock, jazz, Latin fusion, soul - these master drummers have
        backed up the likes of Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, Carlos Santana and
        now - each other.</image:caption
