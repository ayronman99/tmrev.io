        >The inhabitants of the continent of Cruzon are born with the ability to
        freely control quartz. Technology based on this power allows them to
        perform a great multitude of tasks such as shoot projectiles and pilot
        mobile suits (called Golems in this society). Rygart Arrow is an
        un-sorcerer, a rare individual who is unable to levitate even the
        smallest crystal. Living with his brother on a farm, he receives a
        letter from an old friend, Hodr, the current king. Close companion of
        the king and queen when they were students at Assam Military School,
        Arrow is informed that a war is about to occur. Hodr called him because
        an ancient type of Golem has been found in a mining shaft. No one has
        been able to move it and Queen Sigyn, an expert engineer, suspects that
        maybe an un-sorcerer might be the key to activate it.</image:caption
