        >A journey into the dark side of gangsterism and drugs. The movie begins
        with a young Castello growing up surrounded by criminal activities in
        Sungai Golok and eventually becoming involved in them. Whilst on the
        rise in his criminal career, he falls for Chalita, the sister of an
        associate, and gets married to her. The marriage is short lived as
        Castello eventually gets caught and is sentenced to prison for his
        crimes. In prison, Castello turns over a new leaf in the hopes of
        atoning for his bad deeds. However, all is not as easy as it seems upon
        his release.</image:caption
