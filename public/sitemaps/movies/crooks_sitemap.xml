        >During a late night drinking binge with bartender Nicky (Michael
        Marino), sixty-five year-old postman Sol Solzberg (Charlie Callas) leaks
        the details of his life-long plan to rob some valuable stamps from the
        local post office. Sol then promptly drops dead of a heart attack.
        Suddenly armed with his sure-fire answer to his financial woes, Nicky
        assembles a "crack" team of hapless crooks, headed by his best friend
        Paul (Jim Norton), and begins to plan and execute the caper. Whoever
        said crime doesn't pay had this gang of moronic Jersey boys in
        mind!</image:caption
