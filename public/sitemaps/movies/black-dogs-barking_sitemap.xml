        >Restless and young, best buddies Selim and Çaça live a meager existence
        on the outskirts of Istanbul. By day they breed pigeons on the roof, by
        night they roam the streets with their entourage in their pimped-up car,
        "My Orange Angel". Their neighborhood's view of the city's gigantic
        business towers accelerates their ambitions. The two buddies want to
        open their own parking-lot business near a gigantic mall, and they just
        might get lucky, since they're supported by the local mafia
        boss.</image:caption
