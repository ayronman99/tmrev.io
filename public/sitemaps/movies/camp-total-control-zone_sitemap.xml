        >Shin Dong-Huyk was born on November 19, 1983 as a political prisoner in
        a North Korean re-education camp. He was a child of two prisoners who
        had been married by order of the wardens. He spent his entire childhood
        and youth in Camp 14, in fact a death camp. He was forced to labor since
        he was six years old and suffered from hunger, beatings and torture,
        always at the mercy of the wardens. He knew nothing about the world
        outside the barbed-wire fences. At the age of 23, with the help of an
        older prisoner, he managed to escape. For months he traveled through
        North Korea and China and finally to South Korea, where he encountered a
        world completely strange to him.</image:caption
