        >JC (Alexander Polli) is a B.A.S.E. Jumper, a global playboy who lives
        his life quite literally on the edge, pursuing man’s greatest dream – to
        fly. When a jump goes wrong, that dream is violently shattered. Haunted
        by the event, JC is drawn to his best friend’s lover, ASH (Julie Dray),
        as he pushes himself harder than ever before – flying lower, closer,
        faster and recording every moment on film. Soon JC’s dark descent
        threatens not only his own life but the lives of all those around him.
