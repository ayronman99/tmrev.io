        >A series of ritual murders shakes Hamburg. First a songwriter is
        stabbed and scalped, then a scientist. Investigations by
        Kriminalhauptkommissar Jan Fabel lead into the left student scene of the
        1980s. Both victims belonged to the environment of the terrorist Franz
        MÃ¼hlhaus, who was shot during a police operation. His followers could
        then start a new life. It quickly becomes clear: the key to the current
        murders lies in the case at the time.</image:caption
