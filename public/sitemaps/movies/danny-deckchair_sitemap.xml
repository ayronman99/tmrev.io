        >Based on a true story, the tale of a cement truck driver named Danny,
        whose long awaited vacation is cancelled thanks to his scheming
        girlfriend, Trudy. Danny escapes his grim life in suburban Australia and
        blasts into the skies in a chair tied with helium balloons. A mighty
        thunderstorm blows him clean off the map, and spits him out far away
        over the lush green town of Clarence. In this new town, he rockets into
        the world of Glenda, the town's only parking cop. While the media back
        home becomes obsessed with the story of his disappearance, Danny gets to
        reinvent himself in this new town, and in his great adventure, he
        discovers a true soul mate in Glenda. Fate catches up with him
        eventually, as Danny's true identity is revealed and Trudy--now a
        tabloid celebrity--comes to the idyllic town to claim Danny and drag him
        back to Sydney. Danny, however, is a changed man; he's discovered what
        it means to be happy and has found a new self-worth.</image:caption
