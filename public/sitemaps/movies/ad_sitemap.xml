        >In a desperate attempt to reach Europe and crouched before an airstrip
        in Cameroon, a six-year-old boy and his older sister wait to sneak into
        the holds of an airplane. Not too far away, an environmental activist
        contemplates the terrible image of an elephant, dead and fangless. Not
        only do you have to fight against poaching, but you will also have to
        meet the problems of your newly arrived daughter from Spain. Thousands
        of kilometers to the north, in Melilla, a group of civil guards prepare
        to face the furious crowd of sub-Saharan people who have begun the
        assault on the fence. Three stories linked by a central theme, in which
        none of its protagonists know that their destinies are doomed to cross
        and that their lives will no longer be the same.</image:caption
