        >In this action picture from Ireland, Johnny T (Stuart Sinclair Blyth)
        from Belfast makes his living stealing cars but wants to get out of the
        business while luck is still on his side. However, he's been having
        troubles with Whacker (Gavin Kelty), a thief from Dublin who wants to
        take his piece of the business -- and his girlfriend. To settle their
        differences, the two agree to take part in a Dublin to Belfast road
        race, with Johnny, Whacker, and several others stealing a fleet of cars
        for an off-the-books rally.</image:caption
