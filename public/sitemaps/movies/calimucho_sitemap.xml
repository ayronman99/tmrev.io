        >Dicky bears the full weight of the small, financially unstable family
        circus on her shoulders. She has an ambivalent relationship with her
        brother-in-law Willy, who is the widower of Dicky's deceased sister
        Jena. Dicky takes care of Willy's little son Timo, and treats him as if
        he is her own son. When Willy's parents suggest Timo should go to a
        boarding-school to get a normal education, Dicky is very much upset. She
        cannot understand why Willy doesn't support her and why he thinks of
        putting his own son away. Young Tunisian tent builder Tarek has just
        arrived to work in the circus. Because Willy drinks a lot and often gets
        aggressive, Dicky spends more and more time in Tarek's company. Slowly
        but surely already faltering relationships start disrupting the circus.
        Dicky realizes that she must make a drastic choice. This is not the
        choice between the two men in her life, but between her love for little
        Timo, her loyalty to her family and the circus, and her own personal
        freedom.</image:caption
