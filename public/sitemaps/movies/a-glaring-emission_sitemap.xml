        >Brian Torro (Sean Dennison) has built his career -- and his sizable
        fortune -- on his ability to make people believe anything. When a client
        (Joe Reed) uncovers his ruse by chance and tries to blackmail him for 50
        million euros, Torro's only got a week to turn the tables. Director
        Aaron Moorhead also co-wrote the screenplay for this independent drama
        about the fine art of B.S. -- and the business of carbon
        emissions.</image:caption
