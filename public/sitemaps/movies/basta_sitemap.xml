        >A small boy and his retarded brother are completely dominated by their
        old, grumpy, angry mother. She swears, beats and doesn't seem to know
        how to prepare a proper meal anymore. Her embittered attitude is the
        result of the great emptiness she feels since her only successful son
        left to join the army. From that day on the two other sons have to cope
        with this enraged mother. Every evening dinner consist of the same
        boring, sticky spaghetti. Luckily the youngest son made up an ingenious
        plan to change all this for ever.</image:caption
