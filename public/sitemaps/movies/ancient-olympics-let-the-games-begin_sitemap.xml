        >Come back with us to Ancient Greece, 2,500 Years ago to the original
        Olympic Games. The ancient Games, like our modern Olympics, included
        champions and cheaters, glory and scandals, bitter rivalries and
        contests of strength, speed and savage combat. Set in 448 BC when the
        pounding of horse's hooves and the brutal hand-to-hand combat could be
        heard and seen by the crowds that filled the Olympic stadium. This
        one-hour special event follows the glory and corruption of the arc of a
        single, five-day Olympiad. The competitions include chariot racing,
        running, jumping, discus, javelin and two man-to-man combat
        finals-boxing and pankration, a form of extreme fighting in which death
        was not uncommon. With the help of sports historians and great athletes
        such as George Chuvalo and Olympic medallists Donovan Bailey and Angela
        Schneider, viewers travel back to a very different life-in a very
        different world.</image:caption
