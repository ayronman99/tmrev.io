        >For over two centuries, African-American funeral homes have passed down
        an untold, elaborate tradition of burying the dead in grand flair. Carry
        Me Home, a short documentary, witnesses this tradition touch one widow's
        life and transforms her grief into celebration. After the loss of her
        husband, Lessie Thompson surrounds herself with her family and prepares
        for the funeral, opening a window into the rich, vivid history of
        African-American funeral traditions that span from segregation and
        slavery all the way back to West Africa. Horse drawn carriages carrying
        the coffin, brightly colored funeral garments and open expressions of
        grief and celebration color many African-American funeral services.
        These stylish and celebratory ceremonies have been passed down through
        generations old family-run funeral homes, and continue
        today.</image:caption
