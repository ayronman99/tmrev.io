        >Inspired by the nationally popular video game series, the Tokyo-based
        ballet company Star Dancers Ballet's Ballet Dragon Quest was first
        produced in 1995. It was the first show that combined ballet with the
        video game. Ever since the ballet has been enthusiastically welcomed by
        not only ballet-lovers but also those who would otherwise never see a
        ballet, including Dragon Quest fans. It has been highly regarded as a
        unique and exceptional entertainment-ballet that successfully broadens
        the border of ballet. For the first time, this performance has been
        captured on video.</image:caption
