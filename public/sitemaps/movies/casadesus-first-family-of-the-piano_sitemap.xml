        >A documentary that centers around the dynasty created by the very
        musical family the Casadesus'. Robert Casadesus, his wife Gabby and son
        Jean became arguably the most prolific family of classical pianists in
        history. Narrated by Jean, this story follows the career of the group as
        well as their growth as solo performers. Recitals by all three from the
        Bell Telephone Hour archives are also included.</image:caption
