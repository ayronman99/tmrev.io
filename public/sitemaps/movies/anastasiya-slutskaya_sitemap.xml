        >The action takes place at the beginning of the 16th century. The rich
        Belarusian lands that are part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, located
        at the intersection of trade routes, are attacked by Tatars. With rapid
        raids, the Crimean cavalry reaches all Belarusian cities without
        exception. The conquerors stormed the fortress, robbed, stole the
        population into slavery, leaving behind ashes. On the way, the troops of
        the Crimean Tatars, among the few who have not yet been defeated, stand
        up to the brave squad and brave residents of the city of Slutsk, whose
        defense after the death of the husband of Prince Semyon Olelkovich was
        led by Princess Anastasia Slutskaya.</image:caption
