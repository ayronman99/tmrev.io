        >In this documentary, Stephen Fry tells the story behind his success,
        after presenting the BAFTAs for more than ten years. With an outstanding
        career in film and television which began with a chance meeting with
        comedy partner Hugh Laurie at Cambridge, he went on to create the
        outrageous Melchett in Blackadder and has become a firm favourite on
        BBC2 with the quite interesting quiz QI. Featuring a supporting cast of
        friends, including interviews with Michael Sheen, Hugh Laurie and Alan
        Davies.</image:caption
