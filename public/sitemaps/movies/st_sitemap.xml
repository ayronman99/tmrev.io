        >The 761st Tank Battalion was activated on April 1, 1942, at Camp
        Claiborne, Louisiana and deployed to Europe, landing at Omaha Beach in
        France on October 10, 1944. Over the course of 183 days of continuous
        fighting (including action in the Battle of the Bulge) the "Black
        Panthers" became the first African-American armored unit to enter
        combat. With the motto "Come Out Fighting!" they faced racism at home
        and death overseas in a war for many freedoms they did not enjoy in
        America.</image:caption
