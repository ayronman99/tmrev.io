        >U.S. based Anjali Thapar (Amrita Rao) has repeated dreams of a parallel
        life in India, the temple of Devi Maa Durga, & some sword-wielding men
        on horseback. She and her mother consult a pandit, and he advises them
        to go to India to clear this matter up, as this pertains to her past
        life. Mr. Thapar will only let Anjali go there after she marries the man
        of his choice; so Anjali decides to run away. Her father alerts a
        ruthless CBI Officer Sikander Baksh (Danny Denzongpa), who is soon on
        her case. Anjali meets with car-thieves, Karan and his uncle (Arya
        Babbar and Shakti Kapoor respectively), and then begins her journey into
        a past life, as Nandini, the lover of freedom fighter Abhay (also Arya
        Babbar), and his subsequent death at the hands of British-aided traitor
        Tejeshwar Singhal (Ashutosh Rana).</image:caption
