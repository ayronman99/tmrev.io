        >There is good reason for Sir Douglas Wonderly to summon the family and
        a lawyer to his stately home. He wants to announce a change in his will.
        At the same time, a dangerous mental patient escapes from a nearby
        psychiatric ward. Higgins and Lane are put on his trail. But the arrest
        of the psychopath proves to be extremely difficult. Shortly thereafter,
        a mysterious hooded man is on the loose in the castle. He frightens Sir
        Wonderly so much that the old man suffers a shock and falls into a coma.
        But that's not all: the will suddenly disappears and two sons are
        murdered. Sir John personally intervenes to solve the case with Higgins
        and Lane.</image:caption
