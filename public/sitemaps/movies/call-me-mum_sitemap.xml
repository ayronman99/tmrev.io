        >Kate is on a plane taking Warren, her 18 year old Torres Strait
        Islander foster son, to meet Flo, his birth mother, who is gravely ill
        in hospital in Brisbane. Flo hasn't seen Warren since she took him to
        the hospital on Thursday Island when he was a toddler and the white
        authorities took him away. But as Warren, Flo and Kate all prepare
        themselves for the reunion, unbeknown to them, Kate's Brisbane based
        parents, Keith and Dellmay, are planning a different kind of
        reunion.</image:caption
