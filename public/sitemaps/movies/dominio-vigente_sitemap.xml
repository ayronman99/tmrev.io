        >The Swiss-Chilean citizen Carlos Kindermann has returned to the
        Araucania region in Chile after 47 years. He returns to his childhood
        land, from which he was torn away before his adolescence. Not even the
        3,000 thousand hectares of valuable territory he comes to receive as an
        inheritance from his recently deceased father can reverse the physical
        and mental exhaustion he brings from Europe. Kindermann wants to sell
        quickly and forget as soon as possible this unwanted journey. Events
        however, slowly disintegrate this desire and push the character to a
        crossroads of life and death, between two openly excluding world
        views.</image:caption
