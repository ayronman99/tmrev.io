        >Ally (Emmanuelle Vaugier) is a smart young career woman who needs a new
        job. Samantha (Cynthia Gibb) is a busy Beverly Hills advertising
        executive/mom whose too-well-mannered kids need some fun in their lives.
        And Danny Donner (Dean Cain) is the tough-guy owner of a chocolate
        company who wants a major ad campaign immediately. Could it all somehow
        lead to the Christmas that changes everyone's lives forever? Richard
        Ruccolo, Sierra McCormick, Jared Gilmore and Sarah Thompson co-star in
        this surprising comedy about little white lies, big holiday wishes, and
        a woman who may just find love in the most unexpected places by becoming
        A NANNY FOR CHRISTMAS.</image:caption
