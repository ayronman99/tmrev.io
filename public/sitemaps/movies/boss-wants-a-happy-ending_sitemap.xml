        >Sinan is sent to Capadocia by his boss, Isfendiyar to write a
        screenplay. As he waits for inspiration, Sinan finds himself running
        first into Eylul, the daughter of Izzet, who owns the hotel where he's
        booked to stay, and then into soap opera star Faruk, his former good
        friend and present enemy. It isn't long before cabdriver Lokman, who
        declares himself Sinan's 'chauffeur' and Arif, a local farmer and horse
        breeder, are part of both Sinan's life and his screenplay. Although
        plentiful adventures among the magical fairy chimneys, colorful balloons
        and at the annual grape festival become like a movie for all involved,
        the happy ending awaited by the boss, Isfendiyar never happens. But the
        boss insists on his happy ending. And Sinan has to write that
        ending!</image:caption
