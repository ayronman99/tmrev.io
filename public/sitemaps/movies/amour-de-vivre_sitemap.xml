        >An account of the brief life of the writer Albert Camus (1913-1960), a
        Frenchman born in Algeria: his Spanish origin on the isle of Menorca,
        his childhood in Algiers, his literary career and his constant struggle
        against the pomposity of French bourgeois intellectuals, his communist
        commitment, his love for Spain and his opposition to the independence of
        Algeria, since it would cause the loss of his true home, his definitive
        estrangement.</image:caption
