        - the no-nonsense and rebellious Weiyang and the idealist 'Princess'
        Qiao. When Xiao Qiao met Weiyang, the two easily became close friends.
        However, Xiao Qiao's fiancee Chao Yan can't help himself as he falls
        deeply in love with Weiyang, which crushes Xiao Qiao's fairytale love
        story. Just as the three are entangled in a world of complications,
        Weiyang makes a surprising decision.</image:caption
