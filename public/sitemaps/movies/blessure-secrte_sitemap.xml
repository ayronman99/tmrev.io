        >A rereading of my artistic viewpoint with regards to an intimate wound,
        this filmic introspection is constructed from a quotation from Querelle
        de Brest by Jean Genet and from a text that I had written, read and
        associated with certain excerpts from my videos. I develop the idea that
        a violent sexual humiliation is the cause of a painful wandering which
        leads to a voluntary closing down into the confines of oneself in order
        to protect oneself from the violence of the other. Subsequently, there
        arises a desire to escape and a thirst for vengeance which is
        materialised in the act of creation which enables one to appropriate the
        stigmata in pushing them to their most extreme consequence and, in doing
        so, recover one’s voice by way of an orifice which is usually deprived
        of such expression.</image:caption
