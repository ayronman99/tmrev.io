        >Ninety nine percent of the worlds has been destroyed by a bio-chemical
        war. Technology is obsolete and the soil has been polluted leaving
        people with barely any food. The survivors try to continue on by hunting
        and consuming the living dead which has dire results as the dead flesh
        begins to mutate with the bio-chemical still in the atmosphere. People's
        digestive systems begin to evolve and force their way out of victims
        mouths to search for food on their own. Mutations spiral out of control
        into a grotesque finale.</image:caption
