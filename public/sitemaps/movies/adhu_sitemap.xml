        >Meera, a blind woman who plays the violin as part of a blind orchestra
        at a church, is joyous when she gets back her eyesight as a result of an
        eye transplant. But her joy is shortlived as she soon starts having
        visions of the ghostly image of a woman, that seems to follow her
        around. Her psychiatrist Arvind(Arvind), who is also in love with her,
        is initially skeptical but strange happenings convince him otherwise and
        he begins to help her understand whats behind her
        visions.</image:caption
