        >In 1942, nazi leaders met in Wansee to organize the final solution to
        the Jewish problem. The Warsaw guetto was first. Treblinka was created
        in a rural village near the Polish capital. 900.000 Jews and 500 Gypsies
        were murdered in 13 months. On August, 1943, the prisoners revolted and
        destroyed the camp. Only a few survived. Less than 10 worldwide remain
        today. Despite Treblinka tells the story of Mr. Rajchman, Mr. Wilenberg
        and Mr. Teigman. The movie follows the protagonists' paths in fairly
        chronological manner, from pre-war years, through Treblinka and the
        uprising, to the recent past and present, where a series of vignettes,
        often hilarious, show the possibility of living “despite” the
        horror.</image:caption
