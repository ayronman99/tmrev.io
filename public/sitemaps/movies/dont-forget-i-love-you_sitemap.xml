        >Music composer Yao is at the peak of his career when a brain tumour
        surgery leaves him with anterograde amnesia. As such, his memory
        `resets` everyday, that he can only recall past information but not new
        events. Unable to perform the simplest day-to-day tasks on his own, Yao
        hits rock bottom until meeting his psychotherapist,
        Xingyue.</image:caption
