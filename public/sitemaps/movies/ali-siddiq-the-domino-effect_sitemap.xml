        >The 49-years-old’s second comedy special, which follows his 2018 Comedy
        Central presented debut, Ali Siddiq: It’s Bigger Than These Bars, was
        filmed in front of a sold-out hometown crowd. In the new special, Siddiq
        tells hilarious true stories of growing up in Houston that include
        living with his hustling father that got him into illegal hustling
        because he wanted to buy a tracksuit that, inevitably, landed him in
        prison for six years.</image:caption
