        >Hailed as the "Rembrandt of the Video Age," renowned American artist
        Bill Viola became the first contemporary artist ever to be featured in a
        one-man show at London's prestigious National Gallery. This documentary
        directed by Mark Kidel features rarely seen footage from Viola's own
        archive and in-depth interviews with the video maverick. Viola talks
        passionately about his life and the influences that have driven his
        artwork from the beginning.</image:caption
