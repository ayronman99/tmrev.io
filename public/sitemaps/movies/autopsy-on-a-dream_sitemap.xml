        >In 1968, John Weiley shot 'Autopsy on a Dream' - a film about the
        Sydney Opera House detailing its construction process and the politics
        of Jorn Utzon's dismissal. Weiley's film was controversial; it was
        screened once and then he was told it had been destroyed. Forty five
        years later a copy was discovered in the BBC vaults by an ABC producer
        looking for archive footage of the Opera House. Weiley was contacted and
        told about a film that had no sound track. Weiley was overjoyed; for
        years he had kept the original sound. So began the painstaking process
        of restoring this record of a unique moment in Australian culture to its
        former glory, complete with updated voice-over from the original
        narrator, Bob Ellis. It is set in context by a 30 minute prologue
        entitled 'The Dream of Perfection'. Made by the same filmmaker, John
        Weiley, forty-five years on, 'Dream of Perfection' tells the story of
        the 1968 film - from commission to destruction, to surprise
        resurrection.</image:caption
