        >On an island in the Pacific Northwest, a young woman calls to ancient
        spirits in order to right the wrongs inflicted on her. For this she
        summons the mythical beast that has long been rumored to roam the
        verdant forests. Nearby, a young man readies a cabin for the arrival of
        his friends. They’ve been coming to this place every year since they
        were kids, to relax and shape up before the start of a new college year.
        Only this time, they’re about to meet their worst
        nightmare.</image:caption
