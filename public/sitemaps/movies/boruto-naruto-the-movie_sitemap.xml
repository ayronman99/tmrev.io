        >The spirited Boruto Uzumaki, son of Seventh Hokage Naruto, is a skilled
        ninja who possesses the same brashness and passion his father once had.
        However, the constant absence of his father, who is busy with his Hokage
        duties, puts a damper on Boruto's fire. He ends up meeting his father's
        friend Sasuke, and requests to become... his apprentice!? The curtain on
