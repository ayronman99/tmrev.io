        >A gaggle of inebriated co-eds hatch an ill-conceived plan to resurrect
        a couple of ancient vampires, but drunk magic is imperfect magic, and
        the ritual doesn't go as planned, causing the vampires to arrive in
        20th-century America with a few problems. Nevertheless, the evil duo
        embark on a quest to take a virgin bride and unleash hell on Earth, all
        while fighting against a third-rate band of heroes. Mix a really awful
        movie with a quick-witted comedy team, and you get something akin to a
        live version of the popular movie-riffing show "Mystery Science Theater
        3000." In the case of the abysmal B movie "Blood Orgy of the Damned,"
        comics from Mesa's National Comedy Theatre aren't just making fun of the
        film as it plays on the big screen - they're providing 100 percent of
        the sound, live.</image:caption
