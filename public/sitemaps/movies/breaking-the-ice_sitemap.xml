        >Mira lives for the sport of ice hockey and leads her team as captain
        with a strong determination. It's a challenge to reconcile this with her
        role in the family vineyard: with her mother and her adventurous but
        increasingly demented grandfather, she runs the farm - with all its
        responsibilities. The new player Theresa completely unsettles her with
        her nonchalance and openness. And when Mira's missing brother Paul also
        turns up and all three get lost in late-night Vienna, Mira discovers the
        freedom it means to break rules, to reinvent herself - and that you can
        only love if you let go.</image:caption
