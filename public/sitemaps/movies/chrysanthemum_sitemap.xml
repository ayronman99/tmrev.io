        >After many years of separation, landscaper and part time dealer of
        illegal fireworks – Anders – is contacted by his father Thomas who is
        about to lose the family farm. To help his father, Anders returns home
        and starts a larger production of illegal fireworks and begins shipping
        it through the family's freight company. Through the traffic of
        fireworks, the family finds a way towards reconciliation and forgiveness
        for the first time since the family tragedy twenty years ago which
        Anders feels responsible for.</image:caption
