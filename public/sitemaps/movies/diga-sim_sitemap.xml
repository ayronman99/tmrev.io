        >"Diga Sim" is the twelfth and last studio album by Brazilian singer and
        presenter Eliana, released on September 24, 2004 by BMG. Eliana
        dedicates this album to the teen audience (in addition to children),
        because this year, she was accepting the challenge of reinventing
        herself. The album sold around 50,000 copies and was released in
        parallel with a VHS that contained the clips, but it was never released
        on DVD.</image:caption
