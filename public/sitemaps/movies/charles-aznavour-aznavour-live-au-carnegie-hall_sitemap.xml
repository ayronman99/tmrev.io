        >It brought back fantastic memories of having had the privilege of
        seeing Monsieur Aznavour at Carnegie Hall in 1980. Each song on this DVD
        is a jewel. I enjoyed his brief introductions to explain or translate
        some of the lyrics, setting the mood. Notable among them is "Mon
        Ã©mouvant amour" during which he uses sign language. The selections offer
        us a broad spectrum of emotion and life - love (of course), frustration,
        lost opportunity, reflection, homosexuality, religion. The orchestra and
        backup vocalists are flawless. Although he's performed for decades, I
        got the feeling that he still loves to interact with his audience.
        Although in his early 70's when this concert was recorded, his passion,
        supreme musicality, stamina, and professionalism are evident at all
        times. This DVD is a "must-have" for newcomers and longtime
        fans!</image:caption
