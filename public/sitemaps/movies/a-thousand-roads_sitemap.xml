        >The film threads together four stories, taking us into the life of a
        stressed-out Mohawk stockbroker in Manhattan; a young Inupiat girl sent
        to live with her grandmother in Barrow, Alaska; a Navajo gang member who
        must find his core values in his reservation on the mesas of New Mexico;
        and a Quechua healer in Peru, attempting to save a sick child. Each
        story explores what it means to belong to a specific community. A
        Thousand Roads is a fictional work, produced by National Museum of the
        American Indian (NMAI) to explore the human context of the NMAIâ€™s
        collections. The film is striking visually, and presents through its
        beauty and its stories an imaginative entry into knowing about Native
        people living in the vast indigenous geography that comprises the
        Americas. Rather than presenting a conventional historical perspective,
        the film is composed of short contemporary fictions about individuals,
        grounding them in emotional truths to which an audience can easily
        relate.</image:caption
