        >A child, Pacheco, has a phobia of small animals (insects, worms,
        lizards and so on). His father, in an attempt to help him get over his
        phobia, exposes him to a very unusual therapy: he makes him sleep with
        some of these animals closed in a jar and kept in the house. In this
        way, Pacheco slowly gets used to contact with the animals and is finally
        able to overcome his initial repugnance to the point of even feeling
        affection for them. So much so that the final result goes way over his
        father's wildest expectations.</image:caption
