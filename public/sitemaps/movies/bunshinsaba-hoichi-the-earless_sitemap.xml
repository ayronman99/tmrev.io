        >Yu Mei is feeling the pressure of living under the shadow of her more
        successful sister. After a failed suicide attempt, she finds an
        abandoned statue on the street and takes it home. When she discovers it
        is a Kuman Thong, she accidentally makes a blood sacrifice to it,
        unleashing the Jaroona spirit. After the death of a few of her close
        friends, she enlists the help of some goofy ghost hunters to suppress
        the spirit, who realise they are out of their depth. They then call the
        BiXian for assistance, but even she isn't enough to stop the Jaroona. As
        a final resort, they call upon the BiXian's arch nemesis - Sadako. Now
        BiXian and Sadako have to put aside their differences and work together
        to defeat Jaroona and save You Mei.</image:caption
