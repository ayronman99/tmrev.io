        >Based on the life and work of Koreaâ€™s renowned poet, Yun Dong Ju. Dong
        Ju, while studying literature in Japan, was charged and detained for
        having participated in the Korean Independence Movement. Known to have
        created hundreds of poems during his time in jail where he spent the
        last two years of his life, Dong Ju passed away at the young age of 27.
        Although it has not been proven, some believe he died due to medical
        experiments that were performed on his living body.</image:caption
