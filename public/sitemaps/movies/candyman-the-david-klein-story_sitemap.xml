        >Candyman tells the amazing true story of David Klein, an eccentric
        candy inventor from LA, who came up with the concept of Jelly BellyÂ®
        jellybeans. These colorful beans became a pop culture phenomenon,
        revolutionized the candy industry and were personally endorsed by Ronald
        Reagen. However, David's eccentric personality and peculiar sense of
        business led him to leave Jelly Belly just as it was about to explode
        and grow into a billion dollar enterprise. Is there room for eccentric
        genius in the modern corporate world? The film tells how Klein may have
        lost his beans, but kept his soul.</image:caption
