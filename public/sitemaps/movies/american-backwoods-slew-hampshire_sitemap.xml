        >In June of 1994, one of the most brutal mass slaughters in history
        occurred in the backwoods of northern New England. Four months later,
        history is about to repeat itself. The end of summer signals the brink
        of manhood for a group of lifelong friends who proudly call New
        Hampshire their home. But when they embark upon a local rite of passage
        - traveling north for one final weekend of debauchery together - it just
        might prove to be their final weekend PERIOD, as this rite is doomed to
        go frightfully wrong. When they find themselves ensnared in a struggle
        for survival amongst a sinister hunting party, a bloodthirsty tribe AND
        a mythical beast, what began as a comedy of errors devolves into an
        all-out Darwinian duel to the death, and less than 24 hours will pass
        before a slew of lives have been claimed and the last of the living
        remains.</image:caption
