        >Gerardo, a 17-year old guy has just finished his relationship with
        Bruno and starts wandering hopeless through the streets of the city. In
        his wandering he's tortured by images: each masculine body he sees
        reminds him of his lover. Gerardo is determined to keep what's left of
        his dying love. The only comfort he has is a letter that Bruno left him
        with his boss.</image:caption
