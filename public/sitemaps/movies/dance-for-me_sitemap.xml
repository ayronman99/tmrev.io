        >14-year-old Mie is an elite dancer. When her partner stops dancing, her
        family decides to search for a new partner abroad. Russian Egor finds
        out that his mother has set up a try out for him, and if this turns out
        well, Egor will travel to Denmark. Since May 2011, he has lived with Mie
        and her parents in Denmark, where everything indicates that they are the
        perfect match on the dance floor. In Mie's home, however, problems are
        piling up. The family has suddenly gained a new member, and had it not
        been for the growing success, Egor would probably have been put on a
        plane back to his mum by now.</image:caption
