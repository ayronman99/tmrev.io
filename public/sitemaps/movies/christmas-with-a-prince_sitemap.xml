        >Pediatric specialist Tasha Mason is focused on one thing; keeping the
        kids in her ward as healthy and happy as possible. So when her
        high-school crush, who just happens to be handsome Prince Alexander
        Cavalieri, breaks his leg on a nearby ski-slope, Tasha is forced to
        allow him to secretly get well on her floor and sheâ€™s furious that a
        spoiled Royal is interrupting the precious healing time her kids so
        badly need. Soon, however, Tasha learns that some tough love and a lot
        of Christmas spirit, could turn this royal pain into a knight in shining
        armor.</image:caption
