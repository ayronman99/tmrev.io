        >Crash Kids - trust no one Mike Camber is a good kid who lives with his
        uncle in Germany. But things go very bad for him when his buddy Werner
        offers to take him for a ride in his new car... which is stolen. Werner
        crashes the car and flees, leaving Mike behind, trapped in the car. Mike
        is arrested by the police and sent to a juvenile detention center. While
        imprisoned, Mike meets Miu, a beautiful young woman being held for
        crimes she won't talk about. Together, they inadvertently discover that
        the warden is running a drug ring out of the detention center...and now
        the warden wants them dead because of what they know. Mike and Miu
        escape, only to learn that the local police, and even Mike's buddy
        Werner, are involved with drug ring. On the run, with no where to go,
        Mike turns to the only person he feels he can trust, a mysterious
        stranger he hardly knows: his father.</image:caption
