        >Ricardo Monteiro is a successful television producer specialising in
        reality shows. He is 45 years old and he has just received an award for
        the most popular television show of the year, when he receives an
        ultimatum from his 18-year-old daughter Leonor. If he does not come home
        that same evening to celebrate her birthday he will never see her again.
        Ricardo is distracted by business or other commitments and he is too
        late for the last flight home. When he returns next day the apartment is
        empty and Leonor is gone. At first Ricardo thinks that it is only a
        game, but there are no phone calls or messages and after a while he gets
        worried and starts looking for her. He discovers that she has quit
        school without telling him and that she has lost all contact with her
        old friends. She has become a complete stranger.</image:caption
