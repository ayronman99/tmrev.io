        >Cristina and Simon are two young graffiti artists who paint the city
        that they live in. Their restless spirit leads them to defy a criminal
        gang when they decide to paint the mural of a whale over a threat
        written in a wall. The love that unites them, their friendship with
        other artists at La selva- an old house they use as a refuge- and
        familiar tensions, come together to tell a story where the powerful
        strength of youth faces fear, violence and the difficulties of growing
        up.</image:caption
