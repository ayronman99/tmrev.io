        >The mega-corporate Daedalus Group is under attack by a small group of
        activists known as the Ghost of Icarus. While taking care of some of the
        victims of the bombing, Black Jack encounters Dr. Kiriko, also known as
        Death Incarnate, who just like him, asks his patients huge sums of money
        but instead of saving them, he offers them a painless death. When the
        activist group requests both doctorsâ€™ collaboration, Black Jack finds
        himself caught in a spiral of life, death and treason while trying to
        save his patients' lives and avoid the breaking of a biological war that
        could destroy humanity.</image:caption
