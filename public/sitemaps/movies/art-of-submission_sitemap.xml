        >Johnny Sanchez has a troubled past which manifests in the dissonance
        between him and his family, particularly with his father and son. As
        Johnny gets released from prison, his father's garage is going to be
        shut down. The only way to save it is to fight in the Red Canvas
        tournament, an MMA event. Amidst preparing for an opponent who can't be
        defeated, Johnny must deal with the turmoil of his family and answer for
        mistakes of the past.</image:caption
