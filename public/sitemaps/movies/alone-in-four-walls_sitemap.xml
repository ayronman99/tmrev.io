        >In rural Russia, children convicted of theft, murder and rape are sent
        to a home for delinquents. Without the outside world's pressures,
        they're finally allowed to act as children, but for some of them, this
        new life proves to be a challenge. This documentary tells the stories of
        several of these adolescents, who must endure separation from their
        families and who, upon release, are unlikely to be forgiven for their
        crimes.</image:caption
