        >The filmâ€™s heroine is the gynaecologist Masha, whose husband leaves
        her. When a man leaves his wife, he carries away all her hopes for a
        future. Of course, it would be noble to let the husband go, but Masha is
        a strong woman and begins a desperate struggle for her infidel husband
        Misha. The power is unequal. Masha is already well in her thirties,
        while the fitness-trainer Oksana is just over twenty. But behind Masha
        stand a great experience of life and two small children. In this
        situation she is ready to use the entire arsenal available, including
        extraterrestrial forces. The young Oksana relies only on feelings. And
        on her fine figure, her magnificent hair and irrepressible temperament.
        Who will win this fight and get the prize? And what happens when the
        dream of one of them will become true?</image:caption
