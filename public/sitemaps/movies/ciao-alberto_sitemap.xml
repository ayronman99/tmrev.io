        >With his best friend Luca away at school, Alberto is enjoying his new
        life in Portorosso working alongside Massimo – the imposing, tattooed,
        one-armed fisherman of few words – who's quite possibly the coolest
        human in the entire world as far as Alberto is concerned. He wants more
        than anything to impress his mentor, but it's easier said than
        done.</image:caption
