        >The film tells the story of Arnaldo, that to get rid of his miserable
        life, seeks of a clinic that promises to copy people. With a copy
        occupying his place, he would take a new life. But, when having his
        request denied, Arnaldo has no choice but to try and change the course
        of his history. When he falls in love with Josie, the clerk of a pet
        cemetery, Arnaldo believes that he found a chance to finally be happy.
        But maybe he's wrong. A Lone Man is an urban fable that addresses the
        complexity of relationships, with a good dose of irony, and
        humor.</image:caption
