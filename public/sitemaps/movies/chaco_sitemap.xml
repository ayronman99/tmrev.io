        >In 1934, Bolivia is at war with Paraguay. Liborio and Ticona and other
        Bolivian indigenous soldiers are lost in the hell of the Chaco, under
        the commandment of German Captain Kundt. They're looking for the
        Paraguayan enemy that they haven't seen for months, and that they will
        never find. They leave together in a search that will make them realize,
        progressively, the destiny they have been pushed into and the inevitable
        condition of a defeated troop. They're walking like shadows, wandering
        forever in the middle of dust and silence.</image:caption
