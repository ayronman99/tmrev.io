        >An ailing father, who is about to undergo a potentially
        life-threatening surgery, takes his teenage kids into the woods to try
        and recapture their early closeness, before he and his wife divorced and
        everything changed. But the three are swept into a supernatural
        adventure, in which only their Father, Chris, "The Healer," has the
        ability to control their destinies. Lost in a haunted forest from which
        there seems no escape except death, this moving and sensitive script
        tells a beautiful story of a family's tragedy &amp;
        resilience</image:caption
