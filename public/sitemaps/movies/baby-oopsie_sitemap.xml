        >Perpetually picked on and endlessly neglected Sybil Pittman finds
        little joy in her life...except for her massive doll collection that has
        grown to perverse proportions! Every day, Sybil locks herself in her
        basement, broadcasting her doll restoration vlog all by herself, that is
        until the remnants of a mysterious doll - the dreaded "Baby Oopsie"
        comes into her life! After carefully restoring the doll, Sybil comes to
        realize that the tiny terror is exacting revenge on her oppressors,
        mercilessly murdering them one by one. And while Sybil finds herself
        enjoying Baby Oopsie's bloody brand of vengeance, she soon changes her
        tune when the demonic toy turns its evil attentions to Sybil and those
        she actually cares about.</image:caption
