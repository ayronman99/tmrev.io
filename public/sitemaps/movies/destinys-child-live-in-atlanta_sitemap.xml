        >Though officially disbanded, Destiny's Child proves in this concert
        video why they're one of the most successful soul/R&B groups of all
        time. Filmed at Atlanta's Phillips Arena during their Destiny Fulfilled
        farewell tour, the trio pulled all the stops--short of flying over the
        audience--to put on a spectacular show for their fans. Opening the show
        with their Grammy-winning "Say My Name," the group--who famously sang
        while running around a track as girls to build their lung
        strength--belted their harmonies and runs while dancing through a medley
        of hits including "No, No, No," "Bugaboo," "Bills, Bills, Bills,"
        "Bootylicious" and "Jumpin' Jumpin.'"</image:caption
