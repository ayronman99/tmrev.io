        >In the early morning of April 9th 1940, the Danish army is alerted. The
        Germans have crossed the border; Denmark is at war against Europe's
        strongest army. In Southern Jutland, Danish bicycle and motorcycle
        companies are ordered out to, against all odds, hold back the forces
        until the Danish reinforcements can be mobilized. In the fatal hours, we
        follow second lieutenant Sand and his bicycle company â€“ they will be the
        first Danish soldiers to meet the enemy in combat on April 9th
        1940.</image:caption
