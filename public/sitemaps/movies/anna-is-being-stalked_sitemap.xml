        >Anna is followed everywhere she goes by a creepy pale assailant with a
        knife. She doesn't seem to be very afraid. She marches coldly through
        her day, ignoring him, going about her business. Her stalker looks
        threatening but his manner seems to suggest that he is just a confused
        social outcast, trapped in an obsessive, repetitive rut that revolves
        around Anna. It becomes clear that the line between assailant and victim
        has begun to break down and that the roles in this relationship are now
        unclear. Anna has begun to rely on her stalker's presence. She even
        allows him to carry her groceries. Is the albino stalking her or
        watching over her? Anna obtains a retraining order against her stalker
        but she still worries about him, huddled outside her home on a cold,
        windy night. Neither of them seem able to disrupt or end their oddly
        comforting, creepy codependent relationship.</image:caption
