        >A documentary film taking up the long-living giant Baobab trees as its
        theme. It is shot by photographer Motohashi Seiichi, known as the
        director of Alexei and the Spring (Alexei to Izumi) and others. Set in
        Senegal in West Africa, where modernization in urban areas is advancing
        and the Baobab trees, which used to be worshipped, are now being logged,
        the work closely depicts life in the humble village of Touba Toul, where
        people continue to lead a traditional lifestyle. It is a brilliant film
        subtly featuring the coexistence of mankind and nature through the
        modest life of Modou, a 12-year old boy who is the second son of a big
        family.</image:caption
