        >This is a story of a child who was taken repeatedly to the hospital for
        various tests, one of which was catheterization. Woven throughout are
        two other stories - one, a training video for nurses demonstrating the
        procedure and the other, looking through the child's now adult eyes, as
        she encounters women who echo reminders of the original event. These
        various echoes trigger post trauma squeamishness and sexual tension that
        is strange and complex. Both medical ethics and the labels that limit
        our view of sexual identity are being questioned here.</image:caption
