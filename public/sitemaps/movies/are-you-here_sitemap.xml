        >Min (Jacqueline Ch'ng), Lung (Sammy Sum), Keong and Fen are business
        partners of an online game design company, which is on the verge of
        winding up due to the lack of clients. Just as things start to get
        worse, a mysterious lady, Mrs. Wong (Paw Hee Ching) offers them a
        sizable sum of money if they could complete the final stages of her
        deceased son's online game - Ouija Board and launch it thereafter. They
        readily accept the business. Soon mysterious things happen and they
        experience ghost sightings.</image:caption
