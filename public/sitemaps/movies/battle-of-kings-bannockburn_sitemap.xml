        >By 1314, through effort and intrigue, Scottish King Robert Bruce had
        captured every major English-held castle except Stirling. Now English
        King Edward II would try to stop him - and subdue the Scottish rebellion
        forever. This is the story of the pivotal campaign culminating at the
        decisive Battle of Bannockburn, in the shadow of Stirling Castle. Today
        as Scotland contemplates a countdown to a referendum for renewed
        Scottish independence, we search the hearts and minds of the characters
        whose efforts at the Battle of Bannockburn would build a nation. Filmed
        in the style of 300 and Sin City and with intense and bloody battle
        scenes, we bring to life one of the most iconic times in Scottish
        history.</image:caption
