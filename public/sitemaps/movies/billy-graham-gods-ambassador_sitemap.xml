        >The modern world has never known a more revered or influential
        spiritual leader than Billy Graham. He's been called the World's
        Preacher because, for the past 60 years, he has preached the Gospel to
        more people in live audiences than anyone else in historyâ€”over 210
        million people in more than 185 countries and territories. For the first
        time, the organization he founded, the Billy Graham Evangelistic
        Association, has opened its storied archives to allow a film crew to
        document his extraordinary life. Gaither Film Productions is honored to
        present Billy Graham: God's Ambassador, the life story of this
        remarkable man and his ministry.</image:caption
