        >In 1432 a stunning apparition of the Virgin Mary appeared in the sleepy
        town of Caravaggio becoming the inspiration for the gruesome yet
        extraordinary paintings of the artist, Michelangelo Merisi (better known
        as Caravaggio). Now, in modern day 2011, three women travel to
        Caravaggio -- Lisa, an aspiring art student, Claudia, a sexy Italian
        translator and May, a young woman about to enter the nunnery. Their
        world turns upside down when the apparition reappears and poor May
        becomes plagued by premonitions of shocking murders. Who will survive
        the terror of the supernatural as murders based on the paintings come
        true and the three women must discover an obscure secret to unlock a
        shocking destiny...</image:caption
