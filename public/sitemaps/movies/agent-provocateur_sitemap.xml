        >After her adopted father is assassinated, 6 year old Alex is abducted
        and placed into the hands of Montgomery Lomax, an elite martial arts
        skills trainer and mentor for a private intelligence company. Over the
        next 18 years, she is taught how to kill but before being placed into
        the field, Lomax dies. Alex hits the streets, socially naive but with
        exceptional physical capabilities. The Intel organization decides to cut
        its losses and dispatches assets to terminate Alex. She harshly deals
        with them forcing the company to reassess. Elite instructor Lester Casey
        tricks Alex into surrendering herself and through a series of brutal
        retraining methods, breaks her down making her compliant, but the spark
        of moral right that Lomax lit in her as a young girl, still flickers.
        After a conspiracy of betrayal, Alex goes after those who hurt her
        culminating in a series of lethal battles that push her skills to the
        limit.</image:caption
