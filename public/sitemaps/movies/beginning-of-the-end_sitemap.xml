        >A pandemic spreads and the death toll soars. In a venerable hotel an
        elevator gets stuck. The pregnant Irene, the receptionist Mia, the
        janitor Kristof, and the actress Liz are trapped. On a radio they hear
        the world outside collapsing. As hunger and thirst increase the elevator
        turns from safe haven to death trap. As they lose hope they let go of
        built-in defenses and get under each others skin. Kristof and Mia have a
        common past laden with betrayal and sorrow. Irene is married to a man
        who abuses her. Liz is torturing herself over the death of a child.
        Finally Irenes water breaks and there is no alternative but to cut the
        cable that holds the elevator and plunge towards an unknown
        fate.</image:caption
