        >A Christian girl, Rachel Whitaker (Jordan Trovillion) goes off to
        college for her freshman year and begins to be influenced by her popular
        Biology professor (Harry Anderson) who teaches that evolution is the
        answer to the origins of life. When Rachelâ€™s father, Stephen Whitaker
        (Jay Pickett) senses something changing with his daughter, he begins to
        examine the situation and what he discovers catches him completely off
        guard. Now very concerned about Rachel drifting away from her Christian
        faith, he tries to do something about it!</image:caption
