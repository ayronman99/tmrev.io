        >Dutch composer Simeon ten Holt achieved worldwide renown in 1979, when
        his work for four pianos Canto Ostinato was first performed. Although
        some music experts viewed it with disdain - it broke with prevailing
        notions of serialism and tonality - the piece was a huge hit in the
        contemporary classical music world. In the years since, numerous
        musicians have released their recordings of Canto, and it is still being
        performed around the world. Director Ramon Gieling interviewed a large
        number of people about the sometimes far-reaching impact this
        composition has had on their lives. One interviewee tells of how Canto
        was the soundtrack to the birth of her son; another has a section of the
        score tattooed on his arm. Gieling seeks to unravel the mystery of the
        universal power of music, and his blend of documentary footage, fiction,
        essays and archive material produces a multifaceted response to the
        question of just what it is about this piece that touches people so
        deeply.</image:caption
