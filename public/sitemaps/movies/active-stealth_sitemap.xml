        >After Captain Murphy lost some of his men on his last mission to Mexico
        to bring back a US Senator, he has been plagued with unhappiness and bad
        dreams. When Murphy is given orders to go back to Mexico to help Mexican
        people slaving for Salvatore, a rich drug dealer, he must use a new
        technology plane to get there. The plane is technically advanced with a
        new protection luxury called 'Active Stealth'. Murphy and his men get
        aboard the 'Active Stealth', piloted by Hollywood who dreams of being an
        actor and embark to Mexico. The action never stops from then on when
        Salvatore sends his men in to block them from getting
        through.</image:caption
