        >An excellent display of how humans can rehabilitate and restore an area
        where a heavy industry polluted the water so severely that it was
        unsuitable to sustain any kind of life. A a film showing how birds
        returned to an environment once devastated by industry. The lakes around
        the northern Slovenian town of Velenje, placed in the Central Europe,
        are geographic center of the film. They emerged as the land above the
        lignite mines subsided and the depressions were filled with water. The
        mines started operating at the end of the 19th century. In the mid 20th
        century a power plant was built that caused a severe pollution of the
        lake waters to the extent of the lakes not being fit for any kind of
        life. As a consequence many birds moved from these parts. After a long
        ecological restoration that started in the mid 1980s, life returned to
        the water. Gradually the birds returned as well, including some there
        were previously never observed in this area.</image:caption
