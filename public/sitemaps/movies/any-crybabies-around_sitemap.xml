        >A man is caught on live national TV naked and drunk in the middle of
        the sacred Namahage festival, where men dressed in ogre-like costumes
        visit homes to scare kids into behaving during the next year. Tasuku, a
        young father, is ostracized for shaming the village and its tradition
        and flees to Tokyo alone. Two years later, he returns to his hometown to
        make it up to his ex-wife and their little daughter, only to find
        himself faced with a very difficult situation.</image:caption
