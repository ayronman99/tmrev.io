        >Villagers of Kovilj grow cattle on the Danube islands. Marko, an owner
        of ten horses, around twenty cows and other cattle is a good friend with
        a Roma named Kamer, who helps him sell the cattle at local fairs.
        Željko, a young horse breeder leads the villagers when they try to save
        the cattle in the spring of 2006 from the big flood. An attractive
        waitress Ana rivets attention of the young men from Kovilj. Life and
        work close to the Danube connect the Roma people and the locals, and
        together they show up at the village gatherings (birthdays, patron
        saint’s days). After unsuccessful emotional relationships, Ana and a
        couple of her friends decide to leave the village and seek happiness on
        the other bank of the Danube.</image:caption
