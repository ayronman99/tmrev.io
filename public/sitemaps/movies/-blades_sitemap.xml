        >Trained in clandestine combat from childhood, the Jinyiwei were masters
        of the 14 Blades; eight being for torture, five for killing, and the
        last blade reserved for suicide when a mission failed. An elite force of
        secret agents with a license to kill, the Jinyiwei devoted their lives
        and lethal prowess to the service of the Emperor alone. When the
        Imperial Court is taken over by evil eunuch Jia, the best of the
        Jinyiwei, Qinglong is assigned to steal a list identifying those still
        loyal to the Emperor. However unbeknownst to Qinglong, the Jinyiwei have
        fallen under the control of Jia, and during the mission Qinglong is
        betrayed and barely escapes with his life. Now as the most wanted man in
        the land, Qinglong must seek out and rally the loyalists to rise against
        Jia and restore the Emperor to power. In his way are the deadliest
        assassins in the land, his former brethren, the Jinyiwei.</image:caption
