        >When Dezzie befriends new boy Yasin at his school, little does he know
        his life will take an unexpected turn that will ultimately shape his
        future. Having witnessed the perpetual racist taunts and bullying to the
        quiet Chinese newcomer, Dezzie, no stranger to beatings himself, stands
        up to Yasin's persecutors and wins the respect, not only of his
        tormentors, but more importantly of Yasin, and his
        family.</image:caption
