        >I just a did a film with my ‘Acting Bad’ class called After Warhol,
        where we watched a few of the Warhol screen tests and then mimicked
        them. It’s not what he does but a manipulation; I got them to act as
        they thought a screen test would be in a Warhol sense, and then I
        recontextualised it so we could talk about how acting might not be
        screened the way you thought you acted. Especially today with these
        manipulations, and Hollywood films with collaging and green screens:
        groups of people going ‘aaaah!’, like that, and the monster isn’t even
        there. So it’s that idea. But it’s a nice little film, with an amazingly
        diverse group of students.</image:caption
