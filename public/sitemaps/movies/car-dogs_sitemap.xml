        >Malcolm is a brilliant, callous businessman who is a vicious,
        overbearing father. Mark is the sales manager at Chamberlain Auto, the
        dealership that promises to do "Whatever It Takes" to put you in a new
        car. But on a scorching hot Saturday in the middle of the Phoenix
        summer, Mark has a chance to get his own dealership - and out from under
        the thumb of his father. Mark has to sell thirty-five cars by the end of
        the day. The question: Will Mark do whatever it takes - including
        betraying his sales team and himself - to get what he
        wants?</image:caption
