        >"Buta" is the story of a lonely 7-year old boy (named Buta), who lives
        in a mountain village with his grandmother. He is befriended by an old
        man, a liquid soap merchant who once loved (and lost) Buta's
        grandmother. The old man's friendship and wise advice helps Buta to
        overcome his difficulties in life. Buta's grandmother, in the meantime,
        is weaving a special carpet in memory of Buta's mother. The carpet
        features a special pattern (also called "Buta"), which represents love.
        The boy is inspired by his grandmother's work, and decides to make his
        own "buta" made of rocks and stones, high on the top of the
        mountain...</image:caption
