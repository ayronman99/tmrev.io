        >Pooja and Chander Kapoor have a heart-to-heart conversation on the
        telephone. When they finally meet and all is reveal they both fell in
        love with each other; Chander lives with his advocate dad Dilip Dev
        Kapoor while Pooja lives a wealthy but stressful family life with her
        alcoholic dad, her Dai Maa and a self-senile mother. Unfortunately for
        them Pooja's parents would like her to marry a person of their choice;
        this pits Chander against them. Then one day Pooja goes missing and the
        police headed by a rowdy inspector Mathur arrests Chander for abducting
        her much to his shock. Then Chander escapes from police custody and
        begins a man-hunt for Pooja.</image:caption
