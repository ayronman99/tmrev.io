        >After the passing away of her parents, Simran Malhotra lives a wealthy
        lifestyle with her uncle, Rajendra. She has always won beauty pageants
        during her college days, and when an opportunity arises, she enters her
        name in a local beauty contest. This news is not welcomed by
        fellow-collegian, Tanya Khurana, who has always been the runner-up. She
        confides to her brother, Ajit, who assures her that Simran will be made
        to change her mind. Ajit makes some intimidating phone calls and even
        threatens her in person when she is alone, but to no avail, Simran does
        take part in the contest, and wins again. This breaks Tanya's heart, and
        an enraged Ajit, who swears that he will only rest after he kills or
        seriously disfigures Simran. Simran, her friend, Kajal, along with
        Sameer and Kunal decide to go to Khandala to celebrate Simran's win, and
        when the boys go to get something to eat, Ajit attacks Simran and
        Kajal...</image:caption
