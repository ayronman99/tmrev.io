        >In a small town, the silence is shattered by a rash of disappearances
        at the swamp near the old deserted factories. Bodies are being
        discovered with no blood left in their bodies. It's up to a park ranger
        and the town sheriff to discover what ungodly creature is responsible
        for these deaths. It's only a matter of time before they discover that
        what they seek are leeches that have grown to unbelievable size. We
        bleed- they feed! Remake of the B-cult classic.</image:caption
