        >Set in 2022, technology has advanced to the point where the human
        nervous system can be seamlessly integrated into external networks
        thanks to nanomachines. People leave their bodies behind in water tanks
        while traversing through cyberspace. However, a crisis known as "Early
        Rapture" occurs where the system becomes overloaded, resulting in
        thousands of consciousnesses being lost in the network. Remu Mikage's
        sister Shiki is one of them, and in an attempt to look for her he visits
        her apartment. He encounters Shiki there, who informs him that the
        person he is speaking to isn't his sister, and has somehow taken over
        her body.</image:caption
