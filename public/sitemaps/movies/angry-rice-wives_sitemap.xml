        >In August, 1918, Matsuura Ito lives in a coastal village of Toyama with
        her husband and three children. During the summer, there wasn't much
        fish to catch, so her husband has been far away from home to catch fish.
        To support herself and her children, Ito carries goods from ships like
        the other women in the village. Meanwhile, the residents encounter
        rising prices for rice. The women are unable to feed their family due to
        the high prices of rice. The women ask a nearby rice store to sell rice
        at lower prices, but it fails. The price of rice continues to rise
        daily. Due to an incident, Ito and the other village women step up to
        the plate.</image:caption
