        kidnapped their dog. Dean Cain stars as Glenn Barrows, a recent widower
        doing his best to raise his young kids Elliot and Phoebe, who really

        healing seems to have begun, Glenn's dog-hating, gold-digging new
        girlfriend spoils their newfound happiness by sending Belle away. Will
        the young kids pull off a daring Christmas Eve rescue of their beloved
