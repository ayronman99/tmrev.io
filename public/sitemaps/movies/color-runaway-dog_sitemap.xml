        >After an accident that leaves him bedridden for two months, the
        filmmaker retrieves discard images he's been collecting for eight years
        on his computer's hard drive. With them he develops an intimate and
        poetic film, consisting of portraits of friends, walks through Barcelona
        and a trip to his native country, Venezuela, where chaos imposes its
        aesthetic appeal. A complex and fragmented film that shows the world of
        the filmmaker that sometimes happens to be as absurd and miraculous as a
        painting by Hieronymus Bosch.</image:caption
