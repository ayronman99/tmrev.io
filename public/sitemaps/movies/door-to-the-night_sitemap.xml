        >After the death of his wife, Jong-Sub (Kang Shin Sung Il) raised his
        son alone. He lost his son in a car accident. Since the death of his
        son, Jong-Sub lived all alone. He retired from his job as a principle.
        Jong-Sub is then diagnosed with colon cancer and learns he has only 6
        months left to live. All his desire to live is gone, but he still wants
        to keep his dignity. Jong-Sub tries to hire a caregiver. A woman named
        Yeon-Hwa (Bae Seul-Ki) comes to him. She is beautiful, but looks sad.
        Watching Yeon-Hwa, Jong-Sub sees his dead wife. He is shaken by her and
        wants to live more with her. Jong-Sub realizes he loves her and faces a
        truth he can't believe.</image:caption
