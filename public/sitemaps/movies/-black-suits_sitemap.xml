        >Four undertakers in financial trouble latch onto a one-off opportunity
        to change their lives and bid farewell to a profession they entered for
        a while, but got stuck in for good. On the promise of a large fee, they
        fulfill the dying wish of a rich Greek who lived his life abroad: he
        wants them to take his body from Athens to a village in Boeotia for
        burial...on foot. Deciding to grant his bizarre request, they embark on
        an odyssey, which soon becomes an unexpected voyage of
        discovery.</image:caption
