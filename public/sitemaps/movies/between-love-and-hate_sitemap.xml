        >Young-Hoon works for his motherâ€™s restaurant, but he prefers hanging
        out with his friends. He then meets Yeun-ah, a tough lady that works in
        a room salon as a barmaid. She takes the initiative by coming to his
        restaurant, when he is working, and propositions him in a playful way.
        They become a couple, but their relationship is always volatile. They
        fight constantly (physically and verbally), but the next moment kiss and
        make up. Meanwhile, Young-Hoon already has another girlfriend, who is
        his finance!</image:caption
