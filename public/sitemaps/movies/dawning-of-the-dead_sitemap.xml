        >While a virus that causes the dead to reanimate brings the world to its
        knees, the scientist responsible entrusts his cataclysmic findings to
        Katya Nevin, a troubled ex-war correspondent turned anchor-woman at W.W
        News. While she and the rest of her crew witness the collapse of society
        via video feeds from around the globe, a deadly special agent climbs the
        building floor by floor, his only goal to ensure her silence. Armed only
        with information and an indomitable will to live, Katya must overcome
        her crippling anxiety and learn to lead in order to make it out of the
        studio and into a terrifying new world where only the dead
        survive.</image:caption
