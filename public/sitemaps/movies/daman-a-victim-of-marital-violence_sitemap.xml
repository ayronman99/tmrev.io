        >The Saikia family are an extremely wealthy family in Assam. The two
        sons of the family are Sanjay (Sayaji Shinde) and Sunil Saikia (Sanjay
        Suri). The latter being the kinder of the two whilst the former is very
        hot-tempered and has occasional mood swings. The parents decide to get
        him married to Durga (Raveena Tandon), a lower caste girl from a poor
        family, thinking she will be able to cope with Sanjay's temper. Sanjay
        initially refuses to marry Durga, but when his mother threatens to cut
        him off from the family will he relents. Thus, Durga marries Sanjay and
        looks forward to her new life. From day one, Durga is subjected to
        physical and mental harm by her husband.</image:caption
