        >Marcus Wright (Daniel Dambroff) is in love with Gabby (Elise McNamara).
        A devastating accident nearly kills her and renders her in a vegetative
        state. She can no longer walk or talk. Marcus is determined to make good
        on his promise to marry her. He is not only challenged by this
        unfortunate event but is made to jump many unexpected hurdles, including
        fending off Gabby's mother Sandra (Aria Mckenna), who clings to Marcus
        and takes her relationship with him beyond both of their boundaries.
        Marcus then meets Elliot Thurston (Christopher Clawson), a published
        author who wrote the novel "Brilliant Mistakes," a story about the
        author's personal regret. Marcus is a big fan of Elliot's positive
        energy and subsequently his writing, and a bond of common loss, dreams
        and goals ties them together. While Elliot brings color and life to
        Marcus' seemingly uncertain future, something is wrong and Marcus'trust
        in others is yet again weakened.</image:caption
