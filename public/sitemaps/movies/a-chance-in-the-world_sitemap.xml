        >A Chance in the World is the unbelievable real life story of Steve, a
        wounded and broken boy destined to become a man of resilience and
        vision. From the day he is five-years-old and dropped off at his foster
        home of the next eleven years, Steve is mentally and physically tortured
        by Betty (his foster mother), Willie (her husband) and his foster
        siblings. Desperate for a sense of family and belonging, Steve searches
        for his biological parents, but no one in the system can help him. No
        one can tell him why, with obvious African-American features, he has the
        last name of Klakowicz.</image:caption
