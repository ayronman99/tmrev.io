        >After a terrible accident leaves Goldman Andrews scarred for life, he
        spends the next eight years as a recluse living vicariously through
        reality TV. His wealthy parents come up with the idea of producing a
        fake reality dating show so that Goldman can pick his wife. Nine women
        fly to France looking for love and adventure. As private information
        about their lives is revealed, Goldman narrows down his choice for a
        wife. The "elimination process" is about to begin.</image:caption
