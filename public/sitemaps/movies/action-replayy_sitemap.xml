        >After witnessing nothing but acrimony between his bickering
        Mumbai-based parents, Kishen and Mala Chopra, Bunty refuses to marry his
        girlfriend, Tanya Gonsalves. He is then introduced to her eccentric
        grandfather, Professor Anthony Gonsalves, and finds that the latter has
        invented a time-travel machine. Bunty travels back in time -
        specifically Holi 1975 - when Mumbai was called Bombay and gets to meet
        his parents when they were younger. He is shocked to find his
        buck-toothed wimpy father, and his mother - a goon-like tomboy. Amidst
        the terror of Raman Raghav, the impending Emergency of former Prime
        Minister Indira Gandhi, banning of multinationals - including Coca Cola
        - and the Charisma of superstar Rajesh Khanna - he sets about to try and
        set things right between not only his bickering parents but also his
        feuding grandparents. He will soon find out that his mother has another
        admirer - who will not leave any stone unturned to marry
        her.</image:caption
