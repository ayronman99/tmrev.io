        role — a clever detective in the popular series. He was the hero of all
        fails, he defends the downtrodden and save the doomed. One day,
        returning from filming in his native St. Petersburg, Igor is in a
        compartment with a strange companion — Savichev. He is clearly scared
        about something. Igor, putting on the table a bottle of vodka, Savichev
