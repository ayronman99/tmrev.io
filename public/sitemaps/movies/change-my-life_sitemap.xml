        >Nina is an unemployed actress who has just taken a lethal overdose of
        tranquilizers. Stumbling though the streets of Paris in a deathly haze,
        Nina collapses into unconsciousness. Fortunately for Nina, lonely
        Algerian Sami happened to jog by at just the right time. But as soon as
        Sami previously appeared, he vanishes back into the blackness of night,
        leaving the recovered Nina with no one to thank for saving her life.
        Determined to let her guardian angel know just how thankful she truly
        is, Nina discovers that Sami was once a promising long-distance runner
        whose dreams of Olympic stardom had been dashed, and who now scrapes by
        as a transvestite prostitute. Realizing that they've both hit rock
        bottom, Nina and Sami make a pledge to support one another to the point
        where they can both get clean and pursue their dreams before it's too
        late.</image:caption
