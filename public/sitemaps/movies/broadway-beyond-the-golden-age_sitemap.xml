        >Broadway: Beyond the Golden Age explores the world of Broadway from
        1959 through the early 1980s as recounted by a diverse cast of Broadway
        stars who lived through it, creating a first-hand archive of personal
        backstage stories and memories. The new documentary is the long-awaited
        sequel to late filmmaker Rick McKay’s award-winning 2003 film Broadway:
        The Golden Age, continuing the saga into the '60s and '70s and
        spotlighting beloved classic Broadway shows including Once Upon a
        Mattress, Bye Bye Birdie, Barefoot in the Park, Pippin, A Chorus Line,
        Ain’t Misbehavin’, Chicago, and 42nd Street. Featuring a galaxy of stars
        including Alec Baldwin, Carol Burnett, Glenn Close, André De Shields,
        Jane Fonda, Robert Goulet, Liza Minnelli, Chita Rivera, Dick Van Dyke,
        Ben Vereen, and many more, the film also includes rare archival photos
        and never-before-seen footage both onstage and off.</image:caption
