        >Dutch singer Caro Emerald burst into the limelight in 2010 when her
        debut album “Deleted Scenes From The Cutting Room Floor” went straight
        to the No.1 spot in her native Holland. Later in the year it was
        released across Europe to universal acclaim and huge commercial success.
        Her second album “The Shocking Miss Emerald”, released in the spring of
        2013, was a No.1 album in the UK and Holland and continues to be a top
        chart title in many territories. This performance was filmed at the BBC
        Radio Theatre for BBC’s “In Concert” series earlier this year, with a 60
        minute version being broadcast on BBC Radio 2 and on digital TV. The
        show features a mix of tracks from both her studio albums, including all
        her hits, and with a cover version of the Noel Coward song “Mad About
        The Boy”. Caro Emerald is a wonderful live performer with a fantastic
        voice and an engaging personality and this concert captures her at her
        best.</image:caption
