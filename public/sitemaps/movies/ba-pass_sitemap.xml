        >After losing his parents in a car accident, Mukesh stays at his Aunt's
        house in Delhi. Enrolled in a good for nothing course in college he
        finds peace by playing chess at the local cemetery, the rest of the
        times he worries over ways to make a living and taking care of his
        sisters. 'B.A.Pass' is a story looking at the fatal promise of a new
        life. When Mukesh meets Sarika 'auntie' at a kitty party, little does he
        know of the city and it's ways and means to survive. Sarika seduces
        Mukesh, shy and inexperienced he falls for her. What follows is a twist
        of destiny, a kind of story that appears in the tabloids as 'heinous
        acts of crime'</image:caption
