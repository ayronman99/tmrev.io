        >Diane McCarthy (Leah Pipes) is a reality television producer for her
        arrogant ex-boyfriend’s show highlighting travel destinations. While
        driving to her next assignment, Diane swerves off the road and gets
        stuck as a storm approaches. Nearby, she sees the Forest Cove bed and
        breakfast. Owner, Helen (Lindsay Wagner), offers Diane a complimentary
        room until her car is ready. Diane, desperate for shelter, accepts
        Helen’s offer and meets Helen’s handsome son Andy (Rick Malambri).
        Impressed by its charm, Diane changes plans for the next episode to
        instead focus on Forest Cove. Helen is excited and hopes the show will
        bring in much needed business. Andy, preparing to sell the struggling
        property, is against it. Despite his objections, Andy and Diane bond
        while preparing for the show. But it gets complicated when, Jared,
        Diane’s ex and host of the show, arrives and throws a wrench in
        things.</image:caption
