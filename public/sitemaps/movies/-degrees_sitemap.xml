        >The story took place in the spring of 2003. The young and beautiful
        stewardess returned after a small month flight and called a takeaway at
        home. The postgraduate student of the history department, Zhao Xiaotian,
        went to work and sent a takeaway. When he came to Xiaoyueâ€™s home,
        Xiaoyue was shampooing and would not go downstairs, let him send the
        takeaway. At this time, just happened to encounter the suspected patient
        of SARS in the building where Xiaoyue lived, so the entire community was
        quarantined and Xiaotian could not go. A youthful and beautiful, a
        fascinating, two people who have never met each other suddenly become a
        room, isolated, a romantic and witty love story, so in this
        extraordinary period, very place can not be
        self-explanatory...</image:caption
