        >A shocking portrait of the world of a recently captured serial killer,
        who sees his killing of prostitutes as in accordance with Islamic
        teaching. Over the space of a year, 16 women were murdered in the
        Iranian city of Mashad. Because the victims were lured into the killer's
        traps, the press soon called these the "spider killings." All but one of
        the victims had previously been arrested for prostitution and
        drug-related crimes. When a 39-year-old contractor is arrested and
        confesses to the crimes, he claims divine support for his crimes. His
        mother, wife, son, and many neighbors agree. AND ALONG CAME A SPIDER
        visits with the families of the victims, with the perpetrator and his
        family, and with prostitutes in this holy city. Most chillingly, the
        killer's son proudly re-enacts a murder, and suggests that he wants to
        grow up to be like his father. This is a chilling film about cycles of
        moral vengeance.</image:caption
