        >A biographical film about the Norwegian Expressionist painter Edvard
        Munch. It was originally created as a three-part miniseries co-produced
        by the Norwegian and Swedish state television networks, but subsequently
        gained an American theatrical release in a three-hour version in 1976.
        The film covers about thirty years of Munch's life, focusing on the
        influences that shaped his art, particularly the prevalence of disease
        and death in his family and his youthful affair with a married
        woman.</image:caption
