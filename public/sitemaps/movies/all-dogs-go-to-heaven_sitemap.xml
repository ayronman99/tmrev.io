        >When a casino-owning dog named Charlie is murdered by his rival
        Carface, he finds himself in Heaven basically by default since all dogs
        go to heaven. However, since he wants to get back at his killer, he cons
        his way back to the living with the warning that doing that damns him to
        Hell. Once back, he teams with his old partner, Itchy, to prep his
        retaliation. He also stumbles onto an orphan girl who can talk to the
        animals, thus allowing him to get the inside info on the races to ensure
        his wins to finance his plans. However, all the while, he is still
        haunted by nightmares of what's waiting for him on the other side unless
        he can prove that he is worthy of Heaven again.</image:caption
