        >Cousin Bette is a poor and lonely seamstress, who, after the death of
        her prominent and wealthy sister, tries to ingratiate herself into lives
        of her brother-in-law, Baron Hulot, and her niece, Hortense Hulot.
        Failing to do so, she instead finds solace and company in a handsome
        young sculptor she saves from starvation. But the aspiring artist soon
        finds love in the arms of another woman, Hortense, leaving Bette a
        bitter spinster. Bette plots to take revenge on the family who turned
        her away and stole her only love. With the help of famed courtesan Jenny
        Cadine she slowly destroys the lives of those who have scorned
        her.</image:caption
