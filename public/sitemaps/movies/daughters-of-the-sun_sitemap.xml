        >Amangol (Altinay Ghelich Taghani) is the eldest daughter in a poor
        rural family. To help support them, her head is shaven and begins work
        as a boy named Aman in an isolated carpet weaving shop. The girls who
        work there are beaten by the owner, as is Aman, toiling at the loom
        until their hands bleed. As a male apprentice, he supervises the girls
        and lives in the shop, locked in and isolated.</image:caption
