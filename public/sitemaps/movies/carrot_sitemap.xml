        >Carrot unites all the characters of the story. The Hare doesn't have a
        carrot. But the Snowman has it. The Hare is hungry. The Snowman becomes
        hunted. The Snowman tries to hide itself from the Hare by unbelievable
        camouflage and disguise, but it is the Carrot that betrays him again and
        again. The coming of beautiful spring shows that the Snowman is not a
        real snowman and the trouble-maker Carrot becomes a sign of
        reconciliation.</image:caption
