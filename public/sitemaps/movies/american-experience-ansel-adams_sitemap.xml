        >The timeless photographs of Ansel Adams have made him one of the most
        recognized and admired names in art. This intimate look at the man and

        art reflected his strong worldview. David Ogden Stiers narrates this

        directed by Emmy-winning documentarian Ric Burns.</image:caption
