        >Claire (Alexandra Breckenridge), a savvy venture capitalist from New
        York City, escapes to a quaint town in Vermont for the holidays and
        becomes a guest of the Fortenbury Bookstore. Upon arrival, Claire finds
        Christmas celebrations have been canceled by the town after a flood and
        the bookstore is in a dire state of disrepair. She immediately takes on
        the challenge to revitalize the store, but clashes with the owner,
        Andrew (Jamie Spilchuk), who initially rejects all her proposed
        improvements. Eventually, sparks fly as the two begin a budding romance,
        and Claire’s infectious optimism inspires Andrew to join her in reviving
        the yuletide spirit. But everything comes to a screeching halt when
        Claire discovers that Andrew is planning to sell the bookstore in the
        New Year. Will the spirit of Christmas be enough to change Andrew’s mind
        and encourage him to follow his heart?</image:caption
