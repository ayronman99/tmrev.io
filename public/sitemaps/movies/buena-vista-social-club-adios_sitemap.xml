        >In 1996, Cuban bandleader Juan de Marcos Gonzalez, British producer
        Nick Gold, and American guitarist Ry Cooder convened in Havana to
        produce a Cuban-Malian collaboration. When the Malians couldn’t get
        visas, the team turned their attention to reviving a forgotten
        generation of legendary son cubano musicians and formed an on-the-fly
        ensemble: the Buena Vista Social Club. Two decades since that fateful
        first session, we catch up to these master musicians, as they reflect on
        the magical unfolding of their lives—from humble origins to the
        evolution and surprising revival of their careers, all against the
        backdrop of Cuba’s dramatic history. Brimming with unseen concert,
        rehearsal, and archival footage, this film is an emotional, shimmering
        celebration of music’s power to transcend age, ideologies, and class,
        and to connect us to each other through our souls.</image:caption
