        >Out-of-work college professor Grant Oldman gets more than he bargains
        for when he brings an unknown woman to pose as his wife for a dinner
        party. After a disastrous evening, Grant finds himself homeless and
        unemployed with the unwanted task of supervising his unstable date that
        has inadvertently kidnapped the key witness to a fatal mob massacre.
        With federal agents hot on their trail, they must escort the witness to
        safety and escape the city before the mafia can execute its deadly
        plans.</image:caption
