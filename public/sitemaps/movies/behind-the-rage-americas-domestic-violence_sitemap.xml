        >In America, most female homicide victims are killed by their current or
        former partner and one in 4 women experience domestic violence or abuse.
        In this special documentary for ITV's acclaimed Exposure strand, the
        Bafta and Emmy-winning filmmaker Deeyah Khan asks a simple question : is
        it possible to reduce these endemic levels of male violence? In search
        of an answer, she hears heartfelt testimonies from survivors and
        victimsâ€™ families, and gets vital insights from social workers and
        psychologists who work with violent men. And she speaks to those whose
        voices are rarely heard in conversations about domestic violence yet
        hold the key to stopping it: the perpetrators themselves.</image:caption
