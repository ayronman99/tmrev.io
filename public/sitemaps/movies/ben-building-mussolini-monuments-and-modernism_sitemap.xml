        >Having previously investigated the architecture of Hitler and Stalin's
        regimes, Jonathan Meades turns his attention to another notorious
        20th-century European dictator, Mussolini. His travels take him to Rome,
        Milan, Genoa, the new town of Sabaudia and the vast military memorials
        of Redipuglia and Monte Grappa. When it comes to the buildings of the
        fascist era, Meades discovers a dictator who couldn't dictate, with
        Mussolini caught between the contending forces of modernism and a
        revivalism that harked back to ancient Rome. The result was a variety of
        styles that still influence architecture today. Along the way, Meades
        ponders on the nature of fascism, the influence of the Futurists, and
        Mussolini's love of a fancy uniform.</image:caption
