        >In some lonely countryside, or more precisely, in the smaller district
        where the word “community” still fits perfectly, there is an old temple
        with a red rusty roof. The temple is called Kôun’in whose roof has a
        tale passed down from ancient times. The tale is based on the myth of
        dragon god: Once upon a time at a brumous crack of dawn, all kinds of
        snakes magically flocked to a waterfall. As soon as they merged into a
        single huge serpent, it started to fly up heavenward. But when it
        incarnadined his body with the red color of the roof, it transformed
        itself into a rising dragon.</image:caption
