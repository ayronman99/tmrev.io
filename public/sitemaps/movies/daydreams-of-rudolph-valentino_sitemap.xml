        >This minimalist B/W silent short film depicts the last days of the
        famous film-icon of the 1920's, Rudolph Valentino. Having unsuccessfully
        undergone an operation to remove appendicitis Valentino develops
        peritonitis and slips into coma. While in the depths of his
        subconscious, Valentino has surrealistic visions of the last days of his
        life. Though he is passionately idolized by millions of women around the
        world, he is deeply unhappy in his private life. Valentino is deeply and
        hopelessly in love with his wife, who does not reciprocate his feelings.
        Though he has been dubbed "The Great Lover" and "The Sheik", he becomes
        submerged in obscurity and loneliness during his life. As he sees images
        from his life flash before him, he understands that fate, having given
        him fame and glory, has also taken from him the dearest and most
        important things in the life.</image:caption
