        >Journey into a secret world where aeronautical dreams become military
        reality. Particle ray beam weapons, quiet supersonic flight, magnetic
        levitation and hyper-speed engines are all part of the technology that
        promises cutting-edge aircraft for 21st century combat. Learn how UCAVs
        - Unmanned Combat Air Vehicles - are poised to take the preeminent role
        in future air combat with their ability to undertake missions too
        dangerous for human pilots, striking land and air targets with robotic
        precision. Without the burden of designing for a human pilot, engineers
        of these robot planes - like Northrop's radical X-47 - are able to
        achieve some truly space-age designs. Witness the latest applications of
        stealth technology in aircraft like the F-22 Raptor, the F-35 Joint
        Strike Fighter and Boeing's out-of-this-world "Bird of
        Prey."</image:caption
