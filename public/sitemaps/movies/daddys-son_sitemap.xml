        >The Odyssey of director Radomir Belacevic who leaves his native village
        on his faithful horse named Knight and sets out to the capital trying to
        put his drama on the National Theatre's program, allegedly backed by
        foreign investors, too. Seduced by flashy lights of the city and beauty
        of metropolitan women, his Don Quixotean mission takes a different route
        and he becomes a modern Ulysses who forgets his roots and assimilates
        with the urban jungle.</image:caption
