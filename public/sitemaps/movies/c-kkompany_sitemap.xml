        >Akshay Kumar is a crime reporter, Mr. Joshi is a retired accountant
        trying to deal with his ungrateful son and Lambodar are friends. These
        three share their respective plight with one another and find solace in
        each others company. On one occasion, they play a harmless prank to
        tackle their problems. One thing leads to another, and before they
        realize, the incident becomes news. But things donâ€™t stop there. They
        put their new founded fame to good use, and this in turn triggers off a
        series of incidents, which propel them to such heights that the three
        become the talk of the nation. Things get beyond their control, and the
        three are left with no choice but to be mute spectators to their newly
        acquired fame, especially since no one knows their
        identity.</image:caption
