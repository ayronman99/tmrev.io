        >A new football team in the K-league, Incheon United FC, is founded and
        Jang Oi-ryong joins the team as the head coach. One by one he
        accomplishes the goals he suggested, building up trust with the team.
        However, circumstances surrounding the team are still poor. Without
        enough rest between games, the players are getting tired and injured. Im
        Jung-yong, captain of the team, continues playing even with a serious
        eye injury. He finally goes to the hospital and receives the diagnosis
        that he is losing his eyesight because he neglected his eyestrain for
        too long. To preserve the teamâ€™s morale and to hide their weak point
        from opponents, his condition is sealed as a secret until the last game
        of the season.</image:caption
