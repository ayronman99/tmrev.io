        >Dougie Waters loves nothing more than a weekend barbie and cricket
        match with his mates. But his paradise on earth is destroyed when his
        best mate and neighbour Norm is forced to leave town and their new boss,
        a pompous English administrator called Edward Lords, moves in. The
        animosity between the two men peaks during one fateful backyard cricket
        match when Dougie hits a ball that accidentally stuns Edward's prize
        winning cat, Dexter. The cat falls into the roaring BBQ and is instantly
        incinerated, leaving only ashes. Dougie's son captures footage of the
        unfortunate event on camera and it is uploaded onto YouTube where the
        video instantly goes viral! The idea of a backyard cricketing challenge
        is hatched, with the winner keeping the ashes of Edward's deceased cat,
        Dexter. The two teams battle it out in the greatest game of backyard
        cricket ever for the Backyard Ashes.</image:caption
