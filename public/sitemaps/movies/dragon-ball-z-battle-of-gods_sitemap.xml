        >The events of Battle of Gods take place some years after the battle
        with Majin Buu, which determined the fate of the entire universe. After
        awakening from a long slumber, Beerus, the God of Destruction is visited
        by Whis, his attendant and learns that the galactic overlord Frieza has
        been defeated by a Super Saiyan from the North Quadrant of the universe
        named Goku, who is also a former student of the North Kai. Ecstatic over
        the new challenge, Goku ignores King Kai's advice and battles Beerus,
        but he is easily overwhelmed and defeated. Beerus leaves, but his eerie
        remark of "Is there nobody on Earth more worthy to destroy?" lingers on.
        Now it is up to the heroes to stop the God of Destruction before all is
        lost.</image:caption
