        >Over 100 years ago, Albert Einstein grappled with the implications of
        his revolutionary special theory of relativity and came to a startling
        conclusion: mass and energy are one, related by the formula E = mc2. In
        "Einstein's Big Idea," NOVA dramatizes the remarkable story behind this
        equation. E = mc2 was just one of several extraordinary breakthroughs
        that Einstein made in 1905, including the completion of his special
        theory of relativity, his identification of proof that atoms exist, and
        his explanation of the nature of light, which would win him the Nobel
        Prize in Physics. Among Einstein's ideas, E = mc2 is by far the most
        famous. Yet how many people know what it really means? In a
        thought-provoking and engrossing docudrama, NOVA illuminates this
        deceptively simple formula by unraveling the story of how it came to
        be.</image:caption
