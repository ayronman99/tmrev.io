        >For three decades Tony Robbins the world authority on leadership
        psychology has passionately pursued answers to the question of why
        people do what they do and what holds them back from living life on
        their own terms. What he has discovered in working directly with more
        than three million people from 80 countries is that each of us holds the
        power to change anything in a moment - and experience more joy and
        fulfillment in our lives! - just by changing the way we think! Anthony
        Robbins: The Edge is a powerful program that will provide you with
        strategies not merely for improving specific areas that you want to
        focus on but for revolutionizing the way you live your
        life.</image:caption
