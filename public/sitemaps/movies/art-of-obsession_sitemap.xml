        >After losing his family in a car accident and seeing his latest work
        bomb, famous novelist, Kennedy Sait, becomes a recluse and turns to
        drugs and alcohol to numb the pain he feels. Struggling to make it
        through day to day, Kennedy's life is turned around after meeting his
        neighbor's new wife, Patricia. Infatuated with her, she becomes his
        "muse" and she not only inspires him to create again, but she also
        inspires him to live again. But his infatuation with her, becomes a
        dangerous obsession. And so he doesn't lose Patricia, he kidnaps her and
        keeps her prisoner in his attic. Police comb the neighborhood, hoping to
        find a trace of the missing woman, never knowing that she is right under
        their noses the whole time. Patricia tries keeping a level head and is
        always looking for a way to escape, though she fears she may never break
        free of her capture as Kennedy's grasp on reality continues on a
        frightening downward spiral.</image:caption
