        >Months were over after the dreaded 2008 Mumbai attacks. A terrorist
        group led by Saifudeen (Daniel Balaji) planned bomb blasts in five
        places in Kochi. At the same time, Sakriya Thomas, the Home Minister of
        Kerala arrived at the hospital for his wife's delivery. Meanwhile, the
        terrorist group was planning to kidnap the Home Minister and his newborn
        baby. Saifudeen kidnapped three newborn babies and Dr. Balagopal
        (Mohanlal) came looking for them. Meanwhile, the Home Minister is
        kidnapped by Saifudeen's men. In the end, Balagopal kills Saifudeen and
        saves Home Minister and the babies. All the terrorists were captured or
        killed by the police.</image:caption
