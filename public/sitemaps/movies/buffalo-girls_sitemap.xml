        >Buffalo Girls tells the story of two 8-year-old-girls, Stam and Pet,
        both professional Muay Thai prizefighters. Set in small villages
        throughout rural Thailand, the film chronicles these young girls'
        emotional and sometimes heartbreaking journey as they fight in small
        underground arenas to win prize-money to help provide for their
        families. After many months of rigorous training and a long schedule of
        fights, Stam and Pet fight each other for the 20 Kilo championship belt
        of Thailand and a cash prize that will change the winner's life
        forever.</image:caption
