        >Pio Amato, a 14 year-old member of a small Romani community in southern
        Italian town of Gioia Tauro in Calabria, is in a hurry to grow up. Pio
        follows his older brother Cosimo everywhere and from him he learns how
        to hustle and how to navigate the streets of his hometown. One night Pio
        sets out to prove to his brother that he is as good or better than him
        but, when things go wrong, a series of events will forever change the
        way he sees the world.</image:caption
