        >"Bellman Forever" - about Sweden's foremost national poet and performer
        from the eighteenth century: Carl Michael Bellman. Despite the fact that
        he died 220 years ago, he is still making researchers fight about who he
        was and what he meant with his lyrics. In the programme, several of
        Sweden's most famous artists and researchers give their contribution to
        our understanding of this productive genius that died poor and
        forgotten.</image:caption
