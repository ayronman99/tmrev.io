        >Unemployed Domenico decides to rob a bank and escape to Switzerland.
        Everything goes horribly wrong and he's forced to take a hostage. The
        man he chooses, Tommaso, can't stand his wife, his business is doing
        poorly, and he was already planning to run away with his gay cop lover,
        so this seems to be a good way to disappear and start over again: the
        kidnapped becomes the kidnapper and the two head South instead, where a
        boat awaits them. Here, they're reached by Rita, Tommaso's
        daughter.</image:caption
