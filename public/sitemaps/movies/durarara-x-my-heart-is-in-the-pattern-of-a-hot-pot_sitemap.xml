        >One night, Mikado Ryuugamine accepts an invitation to Shinra
        Kishitani's apartment, eager to talk to Celty as quite some time has
        passed since the two last spoke. But, much to his astonishment, he finds
        that a large group of Ikebukuro's finest has gathered there for a hot
        pot party. Already confused with the current situation, Mikado is
        further surprised to see that his friend and fellow Raira Academy
        student Anri Sonohara is there as well. As the two decide to take a seat
        together, a few members of the group begin reminiscing over events from
        days past: Mikado recalls an adventure from his childhood with Masaomi
        Kida, Anri explains how she came to be friends with Mika Harima, and
        Shizuo Heiwajima tells of his first meeting with Tom
        Tanaka.</image:caption
