        >A cinematic tale of deportation, migration, displacement and
        opportunistic capitalism, Call Center Blues follows four characters as
        they struggle to make sense of their lives in Tijuana. Each with a
        vastly different story, they are all linked by their displacement and
        the sole choice of call center work they have in a country that is so
        unfamiliar and oftentimes frightening, yet other times a ray of hope.
        Tijuana becomes their home, a place defined by the border but yet
        defiant towards it, a no man's land where everything and everyone feels
        transient. These characters paint a picture of love, loss and longing -
        for home, for an American Dream deferred, and for
        justice.</image:caption
