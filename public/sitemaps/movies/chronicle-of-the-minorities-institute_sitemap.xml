        >Filmmaker Liu Xiaojin spent 7 years shooting this film documenting the
        birth and demise of a unique educational venture, the Yunnan Ethnic
        Minority Institute. Founded by classical composer Tian Feng in 1994, the
        school was set up to help preserve the traditional music and dance of
        the Yi, Hani, Naxi, and Tibetan minority groups in Yunnan Province.
        Although the school ran into legal and financial problems and had to be
        shut down in 2000, it has had a lasting influence on the preservation
        and expression of traditional culture in Yunnan.</image:caption
