        >In February 2004, after 30 years of my life in SoHo, I made a decision
        to leave SoHo and move to Greenpoint, Brooklyn. This video is about what
        it feels like to leave a place in which one has spent more time than any
        other place, and which was also the place of my family life. I am
        somewhere else now. Itâ€™s about beginning of growing roots in a new
        place, new home, with new friends, new thoughts, experiences. This video
        is also about video. When in 1949 I began filming with my Bolex, it took
        me fifteen years to really master it so that my Bolex would do for me
        what I wanted. When in 1987 I got my first Sony camera I thought it
        would be different. But no. Only today, after working with the video
        camera for fifteen years, I feel like it had become an extension of my
        eye, my body, "A Letter from Greenpoint" being my first real video
        work.</image:caption
