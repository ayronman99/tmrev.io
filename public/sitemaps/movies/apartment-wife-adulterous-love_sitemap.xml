        >Two wives who leave their husbands behind and go on a hot spring trip,
        and two husbands who play homosexual games because it's not fair for
        them to be the only ones enjoying it. In contrast to the wives, who warm
        each other's bodies with hot water and lesbian play, the husbands cool
        each other's bodies by facing each other naked on a dark table with a
        bottle of sugar. There is another couple in danger of getting married
        because their parents disapprove of their relationship, but these two
        also change their mind, saying that marriage is between them. The story
        focuses on the liberation and change of consciousness of these three
        couples, who audaciously kiss on the street to get warm, and rethink
        their love and freedom.</image:caption
