        >Senthil Kumar (Prasanna) and Malini (Sneha) are a happily married
        couple in New Jersey, living life like any other born-in-India,
        arrived-in-the-US couple do. He submerges himself in the office and eats
        sambhar rice at home and she never misses a bhajan at the temple and
        shops at Indian stores. They have a daughter Rithika (Akshaya Dinesh), 5
        years old, the apple of their lives (their car's registration number
        carries the name of their daughter.) They have just settled down in a
        new, spacious home about which Malini, understandably, has fears. The
        couple squabble amicably about everything from her perpetual laundry and
        cooking; while Senthil argues with friends about the significance of
        viboothi (holy ash, usually applied on forehead) and takes his family on
        weekend trips and birthday parties. It is a normal, happy life in the US
        until Robertson (John Shea) arrives, to paint the basement. Now, things
        are never the same at home again.</image:caption
