        >Roma, a humble soul from the rural country, embarks on a trip to the
        city where she has been living for the past year and a half. While
        starting her new life in the city she meets Lydia, a witty biochemistry
        student, who soon became her lover. On their last night together, Roma
        and Lydia stroll around the desolate city. Unable to hail a cab or catch
        a bus, they are forced to face the flaws of their love, discussing their
        opposing schools of thought and the reality of their withering
        relationship.</image:caption
