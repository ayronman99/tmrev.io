        >AMERICAN INDIAN GRAFFITI: THIS THING, LIFE is an ensemble drama about
        four Native Americans whose lives intertwine with one another, taking
        place over one summer. STEPHANIE, a recent high school graduate, has
        been rejected by the colleges she dreams of attending. To make matters
        worse, she learns her mother tried to abort her when she was born. With
        this new knowledge, she struggles to overcome her lifelong feelings of
        guilt and rejection. RACHEL, Stephanie's best friend, learns that her
        life plans are not taking the path she desires, and her friendship with
        Stephanie has become severed. Because of these things, she believes
        there's nothing to help her overcome the pain and agony she feels from
        the death of her mother and brother, not realizing that her refuge is in
        finding forgiveness for the man who caused their death. STEVE, at the
        age of twenty-three, has become a famous artist. All of his life's
        dreams have come true, causing him confusion and fear of not having any
        more goals.</image:caption
