        >Before Sam Axe teamed up with Michael and Fiona, he was Commander Axe,
        U.S. Navy SEAL. The Fall of Sam Axe tells the story of how Sam went from
        respected Naval Commander to the man of mystery we've come to know on
        Burn Notice. On what will turn out to be Sam's last military mission, he
        is sent to the jungles of Colombia to investigate claims of a vicious
        terrorist organization known only as the "Espada Ardiente" (Flaming
        Sword). His mission: to determine whether U.S. military aid is necessary
        to deal with the threat. But when he arrives, things are more
        complicated than he'd imagined. He receives word that the rebels have
        targeted a small civilian clinic deep in the jungle. Sam must now save
        the clinic's doctors and patients from certain death. However, nothing
        is as it seems and the Espada Ardiente may not be the biggest threat Sam
        Axe faces.</image:caption
