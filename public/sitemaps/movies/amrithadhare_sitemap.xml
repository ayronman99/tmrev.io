        >Puru (Dhyan) and Amritha (Ramya) are a couple deeply in love with each
        other. It is a case of opposite poles attracting. Puru is everything
        that Amritha is not! The boy is religious and tight-fisted in money
        matters. His only ambition in life: to construct a house. Amritha likes
        to splurge and is an atheist. In the course of time, Puru realizes his
        ambition, and names the dream house as Amrithadhare - a birthday gift to
        his beloved wife. Everything is hunky dory in their small world. But
        fate springs an unpleasant surprise on them. Amritha is diagnosed as
        having brain cancer, and the doctor tells Puru that her days are
        numbered! A shocked Puru decides to make her remaining days as happy as
        possible. He takes her on a Bharat darshan. In the process, Amritha
        realizes a long-standing wish of hers too: to meet her favourite actor
        Amitabh Bachchan in Mumbai, who makes an appearance in the
        climax.</image:caption
