        >The plot centers around the Johnson family (consisting of Chris (Rob
        Hartz) and Ellen (Kathleen Cameron) Johnson, and their son Casey (Hy
        Rillero)) of Los Angeles, California, one of a small number of families
        to survive a global pandemic that, according to the opening of the film,
        occurs "sometime in the future..." The disease began as a particularly
        virulent flu strain in Southeast Asia. Efforts made to contain the virus
        in that portion of the world are ineffective as global transportation
        networks carry infected individuals all around the world. Hospitals
        become overloaded, and the public works infrastructure begins to shut
        down. Eventually, the main characters leave L.A., encountering many
        hardships along the way. They make it to a friendly small town, where
        life begins again.</image:caption
