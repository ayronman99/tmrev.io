        >While guiding us through her retrospective exhibition “Zaha Hadid Has
        Arrived”, the renowned architect recalls her career from its beginning,
        discussing her education, inspiration and technique. The exhibition,
        located at The MAK in Vienna, features a new sculpture from Hadid
        entitled “Ice Storm” that serves as the centerpiece of the show and
        captures her sleek signature. From her famed Bergisel Ski Jump to Rome’s
        Museum of Contemporary Art, Hadid’s architectural resume shines in its
        diversity and exploration. A Day with Zaha Hadid reviews Hadid’s work of
        the last decade and celebrates her perpetually modern and daring
        designs.</image:caption
