        >Tiny Soviet village by the sea, in the years before the Second World
        War... A very young girl, Vera, falls madly in love with an older
        military officer who is visiting from out of town. She leaves her home
        and family to live with him in various military posts where he serves
        with the army. Through the difficulties of army life, and years of war,
        her love for this older man survives, and she gives herself completely
        without reservation. This film is about friendship, loss, survival,
        loyalty, and the wonderful gift of unconditional love, which is only
        given to a few.</image:caption
