        >On her eightieth birthday, a lawyer gives Frida Borel, the wealthy
        heiress of a textile fortune from St. Gallen, a mysterious pill from the
        legacy of her father, who died long ago. This miracle pill is supposed
        to relieve her of the misery and infirmity of old age. The effect is as
        surprising as it is far-reaching: Frida becomes physically young again,
        although she remains mentally the same age as before. But who is going
        to believe a 25-year-old who claims to be 80? Not even her long-time
        gardener, Roman, recognises her anymore. Suddenly Frida finds herself
        penniless. After being waited on her whole life, she now has to go to
        work for a living. And if that were not unsettling enough, her nephew
        Georg and his greedy wife, Eva, pilfer everything they can from of her
        villa. Frida has to acknowledge that her closest relatives would
        literally walk over her dead body if given the chance.</image:caption
