        >Olivier and Leo, two brothers that are moved to Paris and that life has
        separated ... If the first sees himself as a journalist without
        concessions, the second is an ambitious and opportunistic communication
        adviser. No√©mie, a charming presidential adviser, can not, over the
        years, choose between them. To the amusement of Sylvain, their childhood
        friend, who made his fortune in Pink Minitel, their destinies intersect
        over 20 years, are intertwined, in a funny epic, tender and nostalgic,
        in the 80 / 90.</image:caption
