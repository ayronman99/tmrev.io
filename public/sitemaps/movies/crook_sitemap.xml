        >Bryce has been a crook since he was a kid in the projects. After a
        violent turn of events he's finally got a shot at the big time. Tony De
        Luca, one of the biggest crime bosses in the city, is looking to have
        Bryce get rid of a little problem: a man who can put him and many of his
        associates away for a long time. Bryce however has problems of his own
        when his latest dope shipment gets jacked and has to settle the matter,
        one bullet at a time</image:caption
