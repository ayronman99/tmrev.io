        >In his directorial debut Mad Chad Taylor, the renowned Venice Beach
        chainsaw Juggler, has created a one of a kind documentary that goes deep
        inside the hidden world of street performers. Amid rare footage of the
        most shocking and inspired street acts from around the world, one
        performer after another pulls back the makeshift curtain. Their acts are
        astonishing; their stories, more amazing still. Here is the tightrope
        walker, the razor blade muncher, the sidewalk samurai, the tattooed man.
        Meet The Fireman who lost his teeth to his fire-eating act, and the
        Calypso Tumbler who's buying up real estate in the Caribbean. This is
        the human condition at its most freakishly wonderful.</image:caption
