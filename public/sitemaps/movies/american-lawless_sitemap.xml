        >The year is 2112. The United States is a divided country recovering
        from the results of a second civil war. The law is broken. States have
        reverted back to individual territories. Yet all this is but a mere
        backdrop. Our story focuses on Luke, the former leader of a gang of
        ruthless marauders known as the American Lawless. After an epiphany,
        Luke decides to turn legit and betrays his men by turning them over to
        the authorities. But vengeance comes swiftly when the gang escapes and
        comes looking for Luke and his wife, Rose. Will Luke be able to save
        Rose from the wrath of the American Lawless? Or will she be the price he
        pays?</image:caption
