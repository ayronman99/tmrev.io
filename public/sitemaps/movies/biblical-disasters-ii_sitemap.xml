        >Biblical disasters is a fascinating journey that crisscrosses the Holy
        Land in search of evidence supporting the contention that the scriptural
        sagas were based on actual events. We'll meet with archeologists and
        biblical scholars who are convinced that this is the case, and examine
        the findings that they use to bolster their position. Of course, there
        are more than a few dissenters, and their views are made clear in
        extensive interviews.</image:caption
