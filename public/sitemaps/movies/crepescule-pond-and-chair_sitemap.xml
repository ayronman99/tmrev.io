        >CREPESCULE POND AND CHAIR is a little elegy song, simultaneously
        celebrating a life and mourning a family's personal loss. Disabled by
        muscular dystrophy, Sandra Davis' brother used a wheelchair for most of
        his life. Despite the long, gradual degeneration of his physical
        condition, he lived with great spirit and heart, married, raised two
        children, volunteered for his church, and was still working at his
        profession and building a fish pond on his land, when he died suddenly
        of complications of MD at age 52. When the filmmaker herself was
        disabled in an auto accident, his attitude of practical adaptations to
        physical impairments was one that made it easier for her. In an irony of
        life, a little Christmas message from him arrived two days after his
        sudden death. This event impelled Davis to respond with a film. The
        chair was his mobility in life; the pond he created was his
        dream.</image:caption
