        >Unauthorized by (and therefore completely independent from) Depeche
        Mode themselves or their record company, Depeche Mode: The Dark
        Progression is a new documentary following the development and career of
        popular electronic band Depeche Mode, from their interest in New
        Romanticism at the start of their career through the darkness and urban
        industrial themes that permeated their albums, to the departure of Alan
        Wilder in 1995 and more. Packed with interviews with all the band
        members, contributions from their friends, colleagues, and
        contemporaries , rare performances by Depeche Mode, archive footage,
        video clips, location shots, and news reports, Depeche Mode: The Dark
        Progression is a "must-have" for Depeche Mode fans. Some tracks are also
        included, such as "Just Can't Get Enough", "People Are People",
        "Stripped", "Never Let Me Down Again", "Strangelove", "Personal Jesus",
        "Enjoy the Silence", "Walking In My Shoes", "I Feel You", and
        more.</image:caption
