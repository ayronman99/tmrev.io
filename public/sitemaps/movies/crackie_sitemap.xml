        >Life on the Rock never seemed easy, but for Mitsy it is especially
        rough. The teenager has been abandoned by her mother, a particularly
        unfit parent prone to both the bottle and the sex trade. She is left to
        be brought up by her mercurial grandmother Bride, who is well-meaning
        but oppressively suffocating. Mitsy's dreams for the future hinge on her
        desire to be a hairdresser, but her current emotional well-being
        revolves around a wee dog named Sparky, an unwanted canine misfit to
        whom she becomes hopelessly attached. After Bride agrees to let Mitsy
        take the dog in as a pet, the teen tries desperately to create a happy,
        safe place for Sparky to thrive.</image:caption
