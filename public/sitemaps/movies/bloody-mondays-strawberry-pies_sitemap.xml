        >A substantial part of life is claimed by boredom. Beauty, love, work..
        sometimes it just isn't worth getting out of bed. A girl in a strawberry
        pie factory, a stressed desert nomad, a Wall street stockbroker, the
        last living WW2 female spy, a painter who paints Time for 42 years, the
        first school shooter in history who wounded eleven children and killed
        two adults because: 'I don't like Mondays', are the characters in this
        film. John Malkovich gives voice to the inner bored human being. He
        crawls under your skin prompting questions: Howmany people in the world
        are like me?</image:caption
