        >Boi was originally aimed to relate the living conditions of individuals
        in countries where political and religion issues hamper everyday life.
        But Boi became the story of an inner struggle, a quest for who one
        really is. Boi is the story of a girl who wanted to be boy. Boi keeps
        tracks of Nitzan's life and body changes, following her through her
        journey all over the world. But most important it shows us the
        surprisingly beautiful direction uncertain steps can take. Nitzan
        unveils who she really is: an amazingly attractive and vigorous young
        man.</image:caption
