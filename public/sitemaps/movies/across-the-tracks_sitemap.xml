        >When Billy returns from reform school he has to attend a different high
        school at the other side of town. He tries to start with a clean slate
        but his old rival doesn't make it easy on him and his buddy Louie tries
        to make him go astray again. His brother Joe, quite the opposite of
        Billy, is a good runner and determined to win a track scholarship. He
        suggests Billy to join his school's track team, which pits the two
        brothers against each other.</image:caption
