        >Donya is a young, attractive single woman who has just returned to
        Tehran from abroad. She seeks the help of Hadji Reza Enayat, the
        conservative and stern owner of a real estate agency, to look for a
        house. We sense that she has an ulterior motive but that motive will not
        surface until the end of the movie. She puts on the charm and Hadji
        falls head over heels in love with her and proposes marriage despite
        being already married to a loving and pious wife. Awkward and funny
        situations develop as he tries to keep his affair secret from his
        family.</image:caption
