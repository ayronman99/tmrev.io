        >Swedish politician John Veden vanishes without a trace. There's no hint
        he's dead yet but Beck's team gets the case due to Police Chief Oberg's
        friendship with the man whom she dined with him the evening before he
        vanished. When they find out Veden was a gambler with heavy debts
        battling his addiction the case leads Martin Beck, Gunvald Larsson and
        freshly returned Lena Klingstr√∂m into Sweden's illegal gambling scene.
        And Veden was planning to expose his own addiction and his party's huge
        financial profits from gambling in a confessional book - which his
        political allies got wind of via illegal data theft. With several people
        having an interest that Veden stays missing the team tries to find the
        politician and the true perpetrator while Beck is grappling privately
        with his ambivalent feelings about working with ex Lena
        again....</image:caption
