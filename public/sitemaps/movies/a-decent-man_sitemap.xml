        >Petru is a drilling engineer living in a community of oil industry
        workers. He has mixed feelings. On the one hand he is about to marry his
        pregnant girlfriend Laura, on the other he is involved with the wife of
        one of his colleagues, Sonia, the victim of a serious accident at work.
        His new life seems about to begin while she feels hers is ending. When
        Laura finds out about his relationship with Sonia, all hell breaks
        loose. Petru feels terrible guilt, but also responsibility for the
        baby-to-be.</image:caption
