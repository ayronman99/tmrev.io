        >Ed Byrne is one of the most prolific young comedians in the UK and as
        an observational stand-up considered unrivalled. He has performed five
        hit UK tours and has made his London West End debut in a two-week run at
        The New Ambassadors Theatre. Throughout the spring of 2005 he performed
        a sell-out tout of the UK with his show 'Me Again'. This performance was
        filmed at the City Varieties in Leeds in March 2005 and contains all of
        Ed Byrne's best material from the past ten years.</image:caption
