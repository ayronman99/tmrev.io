        >Park Kyung-Won, dreamed of flying since she was a little kid. To
        achieve her dream of becoming a pilot, Kyung-Won, at the age of 26,
        travelled to Japan and enrolled in an aviation school. While studying at
        the aviation school, she supported herself by driving a taxi. One day,
        Kyung-Won picks up a male passenger, who turns out to be a Korean
        exchange student Ji-Hyeok. Ji-Hyeok is attracted to her and what she was
        trying to accomplish. Although he begins to court Kyung-Won, Ji-Hyeok
        leaves to enlist in the army. A few years later, Kyung-Won flies her
        first flight and becomes a pilot. Her accomplishment is well received
        Korea. Meanwhile, Kyung-Won takes under her wings, fellow female Korean
        aviation student Jung-Hee, who wants to follow in Kyung-Won's footsteps.
        Also, Ji-Hyuk is discharged from the army and is commissioned as a
        officer in a aviation school. Ji-Hyuk and Kyung-Won meet again and soon
        realize their feelings are as strong as ever.</image:caption
