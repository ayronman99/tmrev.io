        >Bob Geldof grew up listening to the radio on the outskirts of Dublin,
        where his loneliness and resentment of prescribed drudgery manifested
        itself in an all-consuming desire to escape. It was an almost
        quintessential rock-star story â€” rebellion, transgression, fame, drugs,
        escapades, fading glory. That is, until he turned on the news one
        late-October evening in 1984 and saw a short story about a famine that
        moved him and changed his life. The next year, Mr. Geldof was in the
        Sahel region of Africa, overseeing distribution of the $140 million he
        and his fellow musicians ultimately helped to raise in one of the
        largest charity efforts ever organized.</image:caption
