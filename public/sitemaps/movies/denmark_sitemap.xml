        >Herb’s life is a mess. He’s lost his welfare, can’t hold a job, can’t
        talk to his son, has a neighbour who won’t shut up and a diet that
        consists mainly of cheap beer and mushy peas. It’s no way to live and he
        knows it. Then he learns from a TV news report that Danish prisoners
        have it way better than he does: a job, accessible healthcare, the quiet
        of the countryside, even an HDTV. They’re practically living in hotels.
        He says goodbye (and good riddance) to his dingy flat and smuggles
        himself to Denmark aboard a cargo ship, landing in a quaint town with
        everything he needs -- including a bank to rob. But when he meets a
        friendly local barmaid and a lovable stray dog that won’t leave his
        side, he begins to wonder if prison really is his only chance of a
        fulfilling life.</image:caption
