        >Before his compulsory retirement, on his last day of work, Marshall,
        JFK airport's chief Immigration officer, detains a group of Latin
        Americans and expose them to a series of humiliating situations. Blinded
        by prejudice, Marshall ends up by causing the death of a young
        Brazilian. After a period in prison, Marshall goes to Brazil, deadly ill
        and in a desperate search in order to purge his guilt. In his quest, he
        is guided by Bia, a young prostitute.</image:caption
