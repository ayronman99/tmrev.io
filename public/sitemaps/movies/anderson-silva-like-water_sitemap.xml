        >Anderson Silva is the deadliest man on the planet - The
        longest-reigning UFC Champion, and the most feared fighter in mixed
        martial arts. Like Water offers a unique perspective of the living
        legend as he trains with fellow fighters Lyoto "The Dragon" Machida,
        Junior Dos Santos, and Antonio "Minotauro" Nogueira, in preparation for
        his career defining title defense against challenger, and arch villain
        Chael Sonnen. A man of few words, Anderson Silva walks the fine line
        between cockiness and confidence. A philosopher in spirit, and dedicated
        family man, Silva's personality contradicts that of Sonnen's, who uses
        trash talk and intimidation to get under his opponents' skin. Balancing
        family and fighting; respect for the sport, and rage for his opponent;
        Silva's mind and body will be put to the test, as first-time filmmaker
        Pablo Croce peels back the layers of an ultimate fighter to reveal the
        heart of a champion.</image:caption
