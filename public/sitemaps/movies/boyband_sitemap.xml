        >It's 1982 and Brad Roberts is the best high school quarterback in the
        country. He dates the sexiest girl in town and is extremely popular, but
        Brad is not satisfied. He wants to prove that he's more than just a
        hot-shot quarterback; Brad tries to turn his heavy metal band into the
        first ever boy band, and they reject him. So Brad, the jock, teams up
        with a stoner, and an ex-figure skater, and a couple of reject
        break-dancers from the Bronx to make their mark in this sweet
        film.</image:caption
