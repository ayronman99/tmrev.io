        >Two historical incidents that deepened the friendship between Japan and
        Turkey are connected in this story of friendship and compassion: In the
        night of 16 September 1890 the Turkish frigate ErtuÄŸrul is caught up in
        a typhoon and sinks off the Japanese coast. Risking their own lives,
        local villagers are able to rescue 69 Turkish sailors. Although being
        very poor and having hardly to eat, the villagers share what little they
        have with strangers from a country 9,000 kilometers away. 95 years
        later, during the Iran-Iraq War, more than 300 Japanese are stranded in
        Tehran. In the morning of 19 March 1985 a Turkish Airlines aircraft
        takes off for Tehran to evacuate the Japanese. But the remaining Turks
        at Tehran Mehrabad Airport still need to be convinced that they won't be
        able to board their own country's rescue flight.</image:caption
