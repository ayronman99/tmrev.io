        >The main character is crazy about about depicting various anomalies in
        art. Accidentally he finds a cinematography archive which makes him
        advance a completely new theory on the reasons why humans became
        bipedal. Yufit proceeds with the plot by describing a scientist
        struggling against the epidemic wave of anomalies in the physical and
        mental world thematically started in his other films. This time the
        struggle takes place on the background of paleoanthropology,
        psychoanalysis and modern art. As materials of the Museum of
        Anthropology and other archives are included in the film, it oversteps
        the boundary between a feature film and documentary.</image:caption
