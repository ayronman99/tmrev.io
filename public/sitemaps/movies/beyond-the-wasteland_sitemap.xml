        >Shot in Australia, USA, Italy, France, Germany, and Japan, Beyond the
        Wasteland follows the fans from around the world who go to extraordinary
        lengths in the name of Mad Max. Transporting us into the world of Mad
        Max, we explore the eccentric world of the fans, their costumes, and
        their machines as these oddball fans find their place amongst the Mad
        Max community. The documentary also follows original cast member,
        Bertrand Cadart as he continues his fight against stage IV leukemia and
        travels from his home on the Sunshine Coast to the “Wasteland,” the
        desert location of Mad Max 2 in Silverton, for the last time. Beyond the
        Wasteland not only celebrates life but the ability to change oneself
        through passion.</image:caption
