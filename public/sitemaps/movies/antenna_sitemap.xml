        >Joshua, an 80-year old Holocaust survivor, discovers one morning, that
        a cellular antenna was installed on the roof of his house. It turned out
        that his neighbor has rented his part of the rooftop to a cellular
        company. Joshua feels a terrible injustice was done. He starts believing
        that all his diseases and pains are caused by the antenna's radiation.
        Joshua obsessively starts feeling the radiation everywhere and develops
        a persecution disorder which risks his life. He goes to war against his
        neighbor. His wife Sarah, and his 3 adult sons are dragged unwillingly
        into this vortex. The crisis reveals the personal problems of each of
        his sons, and they are forced to deal with their father's dark
        shadow.</image:caption
