        The Voice in his head that is obviously not his friend. From waterskiing
        behind a drag boat to “playing” with the attack dogs Titus shows there
        is no limit to his stupidity. Just when you think you know where he is
        going he tells the story of his 30 million dollar fuck up. You read it
        right, then he wades into the darkest year of his life all the while
        keeping it funny. The 30 minute story about meeting Bruce Springsteen
        ends this one hour and forty six minute epic in a way that will make you
        laugh your ass off. That is if you have any ass to laugh off after the
        first hour and fifteen.</image:caption
