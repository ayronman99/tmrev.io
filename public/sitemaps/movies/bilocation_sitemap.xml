        >Shinobu Takamura is an aspiring painter. One day, she is accused of
        using counterfeit money. Shinobu is confused by the allegation, because
        she never did such a thing and was at home when the crime occurred.
        Police Officer Kanou then appears and takes her to a place. When they
        get there, a group of people are already gathered. All of the people
        there are concerned over a doppelganger like existence that looks just
        like them and acts like them. They call that existence
        "bilocation".</image:caption
