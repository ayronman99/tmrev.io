        >When her 80-year-old father Robert needs a caregiver after an accident,
        Ira wants to take care of him at home - despite her difficult
        relationship with him. He had left her and her mother to start a second
        family. But now she sees the opportunity to approach him. However, given
        the high cost of care, she knows how to help but hire the Eastern
        European caregiver Elisaveta, who works for her black - much to the
        displeasure of her husband Marquard, who has ambitions as a local
        politician in addition to his work as a career counselor and never
        before understood with Robert.</image:caption
