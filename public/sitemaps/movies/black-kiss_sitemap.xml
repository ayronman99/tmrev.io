        >Asuka is an aspiring model who moves to Tokyo to pursue her career. She
        moves into a small apartment with a friend of a friend, Kasumi. A
        bizarre murder occurs in the hotel across the street. The body was
        mutilated and repositioned into a lurid work of art. After this, a
        string of murders start happening all around the two girls, as if some
        crazed serial killer was following them. At the scene of each crime, the
        perpetrator leaves a black lip print, and is subsequently dubbed "The
        Black Kiss.</image:caption
