        >BLOODLUST opens in a blaze of blinding white light as young Maria
        Hunter races through her blood-spattered home to her parents room as
        they are being killed by a vampire. Hunter and her infant brother are
        adopted by the Church and grow up in a warm and loving environment until
        one night when the vampire who murdered her parents savagely kills her
        brother. The enraged Hunter leaves the secure confines of the Church on
        a crusade for vengeance on the creatures responsible for stealing her
        family from her.</image:caption
