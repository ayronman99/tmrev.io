        >Bahman, Mahtab, Ramin and Donya Mehdipour are enjoying a perfect summer
        in a small Finnish town. Their routines are fractured by a negative
        decision on their application for asylum by the Finnish Immigration
        Service. But life must go on and the 13-year-old Ramin is about to enter
        an entirely new school, junior high. The Mehdipours use their last
        chance to appeal but continue their everyday lives, fuelled by their
        exceptionally positive outlook and attitude.</image:caption
