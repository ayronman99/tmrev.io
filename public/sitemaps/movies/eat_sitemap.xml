        >Novella McClure is like most struggling actresses in Los Angeles: she's
        in her early 30s, her fake name sounded cooler ten years ago, and she
        hasn't landed a role in three years. To top it all off, she's developed
        a disturbing habit of eating her own flesh. Novella desperately tries to
        hide her strange condition from her motherly landlord, Eesha, and
        somewhat psychopathic best friend, Candice, but her body and mind
        continue to deteriorate in the depressing world of failed auditions and
        sketchy night clubs. Can a romantic relationship with her psychiatrist
        prevent her from self destruction? Or will her fatal habit continue to
        eat away at her?</image:caption
