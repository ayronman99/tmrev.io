        >Last June, I encountered Arno, a twenty-year-old man, with whom I
        immediately fell in love. To be sure that I’d see him, although he
        didn’t share my feelings, I proposed that we work together on a project
        that became "Compilation, 12 instants d’amour non partagé". Through
        summer, from June 21 to September 21, I asked him to come to my house
        daily to listen to music. This music would become the only dialog
        between us. It would be the commentary of the evolution of my feelings
        for him, would drive him into a corner, caress and take him by
        surprise.</image:caption
