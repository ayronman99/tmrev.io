        >This is a story of four friends & school buddies. Out of them, only
        Ashim is an earning person, he is a doctor. Earlier, they started a
        Bangla Band, where Hari was the lead singer, but they were heavily
        thrashed by the public in a stage show in North Bengal. They decided not
        to sing any more. Then they started a traveling agency. On their first
        trip, they start the journey with only 9 passengers and a girl who later
        joins them. The film deals with their journey via Kalimpong. The ten
        passengers are of ten different types and also the four tour operators
        are of four different natures. As the journey progresses, their
        characters were revealed one by one.</image:caption
