        >Dre & Icy, two friends who, while on their annual road trip, make a
        wrong turn and discover a marijuana farm run by an old ruthless
        hillbilly. Thinking they've hit the jackpot, the two clear out the farm
        and head back to the city to sell their score. Little do they realize,
        the hillbilly is determined to get his crop back and has put a $100,000
        bounty on their heads! It's a race against time for Dre & Icy, with one
        main goal. DON'T GET CAUGHT!</image:caption
