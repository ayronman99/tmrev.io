        >Jeffrey Catherine Jones is one of the most revered comic book and
        fantasy artists of all time and a complex character with an unusual
        life, an ideal subject for an insightful and captivating documentary.
        Tracing the early history as part of The Studio with fellow artists
        Bernie Wrightson, Barry Windsor-Smith and Michael William Kaluta through
        to gender transition in later life, Maria Paz Cabardo assembles a
        collage of artwork and archive alongside interviews with collaborators
        and some touchingly intimate conversations with the artist herself
        shortly before she died.</image:caption
