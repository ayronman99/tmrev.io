        >Jérôme, a senior executive, has just left his company. Determined to
        never work for nobody else ever again, he attempts to set up his own
        company, come what may, even ignoring the reluctance of his wife Laura.
        Ugo, their 11-year-old son, is a tennis player and a promising champion.
        To reach his goal, he must make it into the Roland Garros national
        training centre. Just like his dad, he’s willing to do whatever it takes
        to make it. Together, Ugo and Jérôme will realize that not all rules can
        be bent in the quest for success.</image:caption
