        >When the beautiful Leonor arrives at the architecture studio Borla y
        Asociados looking for Nelson Jara, both Mario Borla and his partner
        Marta Hovart and Pablo Simó, the building's oldest architect, claim to
        ignore that name completely. But they all lie. The truth begins to
        unravel through the memories of Pablo Simó. Pablo should carry out the
        unpleasant job of dealing with Nelson Jara, an indignant owner of the
        building adjoining a work of the studio, damaged by a crack in the wall
        of his living room caused by an error in the construction. But the fear
        and nervousness that provokes in the three involved the arrival of
        Leonor and her question "what happened to Nelson Jara?" Show something
        much darker and more suspicious. (FILMAFFINITY)</image:caption
