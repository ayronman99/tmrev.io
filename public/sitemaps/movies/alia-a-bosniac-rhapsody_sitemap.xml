        >Alia Izzet Rahmanovic is one of the prosperous and career-savvy
        Bosniaks of the Tito period Yugoslavia. Captain of Yugoslavia, close
        guard of Tito, army national team captain and Yugoslavia's first world
        karate champion. The civil war in Yugoslavia also changes a lot in
        Alia's life with everyday life. Alia, who lost everything but his family
        in the war, is forced to take refuge with a Bosnian refugee camp under
        the protection of the United Nations, along with Anna, a Serb-based wife
        and two young children. The remaining 65 women were murdered by Bosniak
        Serbs, consisting of children and elderly people. Alia's wife and
        children are also among those who died and went to court. Written by
