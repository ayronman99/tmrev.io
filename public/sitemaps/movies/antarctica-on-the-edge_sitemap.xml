        >Antarctica lives in our dreams as the most remote, the most forbidding
        continent on Planet Earth. It is a huge land covered with ice as thick
        as three miles, seemingly invulnerable, cold and dark for eight months
        of the year. Yet Antarctica is also a fragile place, home to an
        incredible variety of life along its edges, arguably the most stunning,
        breathtaking and still-pristine place on earth. The one constant is that
        it is constantly changing, every season, every day, every hour. I've
        been fortunate to travel to Antarctica many times; most recently with 3D
        cameras, a first for the continent. The result is our new film,
        Antarctica: On the Edge.</image:caption
