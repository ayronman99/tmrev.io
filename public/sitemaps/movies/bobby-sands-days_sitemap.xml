        >By the early 1980s, after two decades of violence and unrest, the
        situation in Northern Ireland took a sudden and profound turn inside the
        infamous Maze Prison. Seeking the right to be treated as political
        prisoners rather than common criminals, Irish Republicans led by Bobby
        Sands began a prison hunger strike that would draw international
        attention to the conflict. In the 66 days that he refused food, Sands
        would be elected to the British Parliament, put the Irish Republican
        struggle centre stage on the world news agenda, and pay the ultimate
        price for his political convictions. The film combines a powerful mosaic
        of archival materials, reconstructions and the illuminating accounts of
        former prisoners, commentators and key players in the drama. With
        Sands's evocative prison diary at its core, the film brings fresh
        insight to an iconic figure who single-handedly created a transformative
        moment in Ireland's history that had global aftershocks.</image:caption
