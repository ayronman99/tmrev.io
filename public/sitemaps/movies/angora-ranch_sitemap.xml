        >Justin is an ad executive whose father sends him on his first solo run
        to a place in Texas. While driving to his appointment Justin swerves to
        avoid a rabbit in the road and his car gets stuck in a ditch that just
        happens to be in front of the home of Jack and his loony senile father.
        After Jack's previous life partner died, he planned never to love again.
