        >Astitva is a bold film with adultery. An ambitious male chauvinist and
        his loving wife are happily married but the guy is not able to give time
        to the family as he want to make it big in life. His work is of
        paramount importance to him. His work keeps him away from his home for
        days and this makes the wife very lonely. In one such instance, she
        succumbs to loneliness and has a physical relationship with her music
        teacher and becomes pregnant. She tries confessing to her husband, but
        he is so excited about her pregnancy, that he does not listen to her
        story. Twenty Five years later, circumstances force the suspicious
        husband's mind to work overtime and confronts his wife with facts and
        figures that when she was pregnant, he had not had any physical
        relationship with her for more than 9 months before the child's birth.
        Then whose child is it? The wife accepts it and ask for
        forgiveness...</image:caption
