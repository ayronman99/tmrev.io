        >Harry Smith was neglected during his life but, as more details about
        his work emerged since his death in 1991, he is now recognized as one of
        the great visionary outsiders of American art. A painter, experimental
        film-maker, occultist, musicologist and self-proclaimed urban
        anthropologist, Smith has been championed by everyone from Bob Dylan
        ('without Harry Smith I wouldn't have existed') to Beck and the Grateful
        Dead. With its stumbling narration (from Igliori herself) and crude mix
        of film footage, interviews and music, this is not a polished
        documentary, but Smith is such a wondrously exotic subject it's easy to
        overlook the formal inadequacies.</image:caption
