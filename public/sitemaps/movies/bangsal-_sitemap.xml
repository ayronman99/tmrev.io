        >Nat and Mina stay overnight in a hospital when they accompany the
        person who is run over by their car. Dr. Aziz places them in Ward 13, a
        long-closed ward that contains many mysteries. At midnight, Nat hears a
        knocking sound on the bathroom floor, and she tells her boyfriend,
        Devon, about it. The next day, Devon comes to the hospital and makes a
        joke by knocking on the door from the inside, something that is
        forbidden. Devon dies and the ghost of the crawling nurse, drags Nat
        into the bathroom gutter.</image:caption
