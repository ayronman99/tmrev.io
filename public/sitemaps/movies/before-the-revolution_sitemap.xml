        >The study of a youth on the edge of adulthood and his aunt, ten years
        older. Fabrizio is passionate, idealistic, influenced by Cesare, a
        teacher and Marxist, engaged to the lovely but bourgeois Clelia, and
        stung by the drowning of his mercurial friend Agostino, a possible
        suicide. Gina is herself a bundle of nervous energy, alternately sweet,
        seductive, poetic, distracted, and unhinged. They begin a love affair
        after Agostino's funeral, then Gina confuses Fabrizio by sleeping with a
        stranger. Their visits to Cesare and then to Puck, one of Gina's older
        friends, a landowner losing his land, dramatize contrasting images of
        Italy's future. Their own futures are bleak.</image:caption
