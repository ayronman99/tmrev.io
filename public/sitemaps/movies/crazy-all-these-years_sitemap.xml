        >Worn out from his life in New York, Ben returns home to take care of
        his dying mother, only to rediscover the reasons he left. Picking up
        their contentious relationship, Ben tries to muddle through his motherâ€™s
        every day demands as well as the unresolved feelings he left behind. His
        only solace comes from the rekindled relationships with his neighbor
        Lori and her hunky brother Joe, who has since turned straight after Ben
        broke his heart. Can Ben mend these wounds and return to his old life?
        Or will he leave again, this time for good?</image:caption
