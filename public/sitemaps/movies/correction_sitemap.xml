        >This is not an easy mystery to solve in all its subtleties. In the last
        paragraph, I give my take on the characters. I won't give away the
        principal spoiler. Still, if you want to exercise your Sherlock skills
        to the fullest, skip that last paragraph. I'll warn you. A man leaves
        prison. He has been paroled. The best he can do at first is stay at a
        shelter for poor people and look for work. In the meantime he tries to
        reconnect with people he knows and to avoid the attention of several
        shady individuals that know him. That's the layout. The mystery elements
        arise from the fact that he is rejected by a few, pursued by a duo of
        suspicious looking men, and approached by a bunch of unsavory roughnecks
        that know him well. Why the rejection? Why the persecution? What is the
        gang about? The film is parsimonious about handing out hints and clues
        that we need to answer those questions. The best we can do is work out
        hypotheses and see if they pan out at the end.</image:caption
