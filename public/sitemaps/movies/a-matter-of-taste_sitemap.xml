        >Nicolas, a handsome, young waiter, is befriended by Frédéric Delamont,
        a wealthy middle-aged businessman. Delamont, a man of power, influence
        and strictly refined tastes, is immediately smitten by Nicolas' charm.
        Lonely and phobic, Delamont offers Nicolas a lucrative job as his
        personal food taster. In spite of their differences, a close friendship
        begins to emerge between the two men. However, their bond of trust and
        admiration soon spirals downward into a dangerous game of deceit and
        obsession for which neither is prepared.</image:caption
