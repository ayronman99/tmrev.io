        >Music fans know Maynard James Keenan as the frontman of such bands as
        Tool, A Perfect Circle, and Puscifer, but in this documentary filmmakers
        Christopher Pomerenke and Ryan Page offer a closer look at one of the
        prolific rocker's more unexpected hobbies -- winemaking. Along with his
        business partner Eric Glomski, Keenan has managed to transform an arid
        stretch of Arizona desert into a lush vineyard that yields some
        particularly tasty grapes. Through unguarded conversations with Keenan
        and Glomski, Pomerenke and Page discover just what got the pair
        interested in winemaking, and why they chose such a hostile natural
        environment to serve as the site of their winery.</image:caption
