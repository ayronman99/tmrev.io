        >Paralyzed at a young age, Jing is a kind piano teacher who leads a
        quiet life. One day, she accuses her doctor Zhou of molesting her during
        a typical medical examination. Zhou is promptly arrested, charged and
        put on trial. The prosecutor of the case is Tim, an idealistic lawyer
        who joined the law world to punish the guilty. However, as Tim's
        investigator Nam helps him peel back the pieces, the more complex the
        case becomes. Soon, Tim begins to question the truth surrounding Jing's
        story.</image:caption
