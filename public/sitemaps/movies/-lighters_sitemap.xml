        >Seventeen-year-old Artyom is invisible in the family and a rebel in the
        technical school. He has a best friend, Kostya, and they do all the
        provocations and tricks together. When the management of the technical
        school compiles an unofficial list of dangerous teenagers -
        "explosives", Kostya, by pure chance, falls into the first place, which
        makes him popular among other students. Kostya revels in interest in
        himself - and betrays his friend, convincing his classmates that he,
        Kostya, is the main and only inspirer of all their antics. Then Artyom
        decides to prove who the “number one bomber” is really here. But on his
        way, a girl, Kira, unexpectedly appears, who is able to influence his
        dangerous plan.</image:caption
