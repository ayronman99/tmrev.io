        >Years of war and ethnic conflict in the Sudan have created a generation
        of young men, known as the "Lost Boys," who have spent more years in
        refugee camps than in their home communities. This intimate film
        recounts the story of Benjamin and William Deng, brothers joined in the
        struggle of a seemingly never-ending exile, who are then separated when
        one is accepted into a United States resettlement program while the
        other remains in a Kenyan refugee camp. It is not only a film about the
        two brother's dreams and reality, it is also a film about war and
        suffering in their beloved South Sudan, lost childhood and innocence,
        the trials of life as a refugee in foreign lands and the existing
        realities of survival. Real life in the so called "Land of dreams" â€“
        America, is not an easy adjustment.</image:caption
