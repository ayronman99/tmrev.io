        >This story of espionage and counter-espionage is based on the novel by
        Ian Adams. Suspicious circumstances surrounded the mysterious death of a
        Canadian diplomat. At the height of The Cold War in October 1964, John
        Watkins, Canada's former ambassador to Moscow and a close friend of
        Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson, is kidnapped and held in a hotel for
        questioning by the RCMP at the urging of the CIA. Several days into the
        interrogation he died. The official obituary claimed that he suffered a
        heart attack in the company of friends during a farewell supper
        celebrating his illustrious career.</image:caption
