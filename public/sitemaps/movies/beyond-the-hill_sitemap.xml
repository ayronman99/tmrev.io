        >In the quiet foothills of Turkey, Faik lives an isolated existence.
        When his second son brings his boys for a visit, Faik takes the
        opportunity to pontificate about the law of the land, as he sees it. He
        shares one unsolicited thought after the next, most particularly
        focusing on the elusive nomads whom he suspects have been trespassing on
        his property. The day and night wear on, and each member of the clan
        takes his turn entrusting the film's audience with his own dark
        secret.</image:caption
