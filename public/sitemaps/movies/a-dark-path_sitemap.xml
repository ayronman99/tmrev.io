        >On their way home from a party in eastern Europe, sisters Abi and Lily
        get lost. With no signal and an unreliable GPS, they try to navigate
        their way out using road signs. Along a narrow road, through a deep
        forest, their front tire suddenly blows out. With no spare or cell
        service, they are completely cut off. Soon they discover that this is no
        ordinary forest and there is a reason no cars come up here, for the
        locals know of what lives deep in the woods and if theyâ€™re woken, there
        is nowhere to run.</image:caption
