        >7 girls and 1 fab gay guy plan a getaway to a remote ranch for a week
        of gossip and grub. They start off where they always do, old rivalries
        in place, extreme vanity covering great insecurities, but with a true
        love for each other underneath the bickering, sniping and sassing. A
        number of drinks into night one and a dark secret is revealed. The house
        they rented is the site of a mass murder of teenage girls 15 years
        earlier. Blood still stains the floors under replacement carpets. The
        killer still runs free. The girls take it for what it seems - a fun
        story for a rainy night by a roaring fire. But after one of them
        disappears and is discovered dead, the story doesn't seem so fun
        anymore. 1 by 1, they die, killed by their own vanity. The fun-filled
        week turns into a race against death. Who will make it out
        alive?</image:caption
