        >Buried in his denial and running from authorities, Bobby Angel produces
        online videos proclaiming his innocence. The audience is exposed to his
        perspective as he battles himself, the demon of his nightmares, finds
        refuge in his delusion and ultimately is lost within it. What he sees
        and the world he creates reveals to us the complex and very terrifying
        reality he experiences.</image:caption
