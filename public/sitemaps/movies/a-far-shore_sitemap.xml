        >An unadorned perspective on impoverished life in Okinawa, an island in
        southern Japan whose modern history was tainted by the bloody battle for
        the Pacific. 17-year-old Aoi works as a nightclub hostess in order to
        earn rent money and to provide for her little boy. She also supports her
        lazy husband Masaya, who has no qualms about giving her a few slaps,
        particularly after he loses his job. What chance does this young family
        have to scrape their way out of the social mire, where they were driven
        by poverty and the imprudence of youth? How dark does reality have to
        get before it stifles the rays of hope that filter through? An intimate
        story that presents a less glitzy picture of Japan than is customary,
        demonstrating that social inequality impacts all corners of the
        globe.</image:caption
