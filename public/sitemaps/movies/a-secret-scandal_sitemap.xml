        >Nineteen year old Hyun Woo is thrilled when he meets his new art
        teacher Seon Ah, who happens to be his longtime boyhood crush. The two
        first met when Seon Ah was teaching as an assistant at Hyun Woo's middle
        school and ever since, Hyun Woo has held a special place in his heart
        for his 27-year-old teacher. One day, Seon Ah gets into trouble after
        being caught smoking in a classroom by a fellow teacher. But when Hyun
        Woo readily takes the blame for her misdeed, the two become closer than
        ever. Trapped in a relationship that has become boring, Seon Ah finds
        Hyun Woo's innocence and raw passion irresistible. As love between the
        two takes center-stage, reason and morality took the
        backseat.</image:caption
