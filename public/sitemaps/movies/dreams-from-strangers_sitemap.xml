        >New anti-gay laws have just been approved in Russia. After a
        competition in St. Petersburg, Italian swimmer Massimo meets a Russian
        of his own age, Vladimir, working as an interpreter for the delegation
        of which Massimo is a member. The two men fall in love, but they will
