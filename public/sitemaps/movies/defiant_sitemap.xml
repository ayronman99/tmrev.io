        >Now that the bulk of Defiants have either vanished in "The Taking" or
        been found and executed by order of the Sovereign Leader, the New World
        has finally come to know true peace. But when a young New World
        soldier's amnesia begins to wear off, the real truth about where he came
        from begins to unravel, and the real truth about what the world has
        become begins to unravel with it. When framed for the murder of the
        Sovereign Leader, this young soldier must now choose who he is: A51-317,
        Sovereign Soldier of the New World, or Paul Wooden, Defiant. He must
        choose whether he can still embrace the New World knowing what he knows
        now or if he must shift his allegiance. He must choose what he knows for
        sure. The choice is his: will he be Defiant?</image:caption
