        >Between age three and four, Vera Loumpet-Galitzine traverses many
        landscapes, exploring where she comes from, to come into her own. We
        follow her to her school and neighbourhood activities in France,
        Cameroon and Russia. As Vera dances, sings and runs around these
        visually engaging landscapes, seemingly easily integrated into her rich
        fantasy world, we attempt to imagine what they look like to her. What
        does she see, think, or imagine?</image:caption
