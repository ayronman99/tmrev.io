        >Maki Eda works for an advertising agency at a large company. She is a
        single and doesn't have good luck with men. She also isn't very good at
        cooking and likes eating junk food. One day, she meets Nagisa Katayama.
        He is an art teacher and a vegetarian. Unlike Maki, Nagisa cooks very
        well. The two people then happen to live together. Maki realizes that
        she is in love with Nagisa, but Nagisa is gay. Through his cooking, they
        solve their own problems and become important to each
        other.</image:caption
