        >In 2007, five-piece rock and roll band I Like Trains were the toast of
        the music industry. They were signed to a major label and playing sold
        out tours around the world. A Divorce Before Marriage picks up the story
        five years later where, due to the decline of the music industry and a
        change in their fortune, the band are now in a very different position.
        Suddenly I Like Trains find themselves lost in a very different musical
        landscape as jobs, family and life start to take over, forcing them to
        question their childhood dreams and ambitions. Told over a period of 4
        years, this is a coming of age story about a band stuck in the
        middle.</image:caption
