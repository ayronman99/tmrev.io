        >Brilliantly funny Britain's Got Talent finalist Daliso Chaponda
        presents his hilarious new show 'What The African Said'. After receiving
        Amanda Holden's Golden Buzzer, Daliso has gone on to amass over 50
        million views online and has sold out venues across the UK on his debut
        nationwide tour. He has been heard on BBC Radio 4 on The News Quiz, The
        Now Show, and his own critically acclaimed series Citizen of Nowhere.
        Join Daliso as he discusses his new found fame, how he deals with online
