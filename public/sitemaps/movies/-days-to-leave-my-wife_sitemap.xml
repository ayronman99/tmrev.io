        >The story of a Thai-Chinese couple Yong and Ngak who's been together
        for 7 years. Yong is a salesman while his wife Ngak is just nothing but
        boring and old. There're many times that Yong thinks of breaking up, but
        he swore to his grandfather that he will never leave Ngak or else his
        life will face bad luck. Later, there is a twist in his marriage life as
        Yong may has to break the word that he promised to his dead
        grandfather.</image:caption
