        >When platinum-selling rock & roll band Thirty Seconds To Mars set out
        to make an epic music video in the environmentally-threatened Arctic,
        the band, fronted by brothers Shannon and Jared Leto, did not expect
        that torrential weather, dangerous icebergs and airline industry
        bureaucracy might conspire to make this production one of the most
        difficult endeavors of their career. "Edge of the Earth" is the
        behind-the-scenes story of one of the music industry's hottest bands
        working to produce a global awareness, high-production-value music video
        against the backdrop of the environmental trouble-spot that is the
        Arctic</image:caption
