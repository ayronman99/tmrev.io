        >Ever wondered how to crystallize the body of a cat? Here M.M. Serra's
        dark and ethereal exploration of counterculture and body manipulation
        extends to the animal kingdom. Artist Katherine Bauer recites her recipe
        for Crystallum, her playfully witchy process of growing crystals on the
        carcass of her deceased feline friend, Pickles. Bauer also quotes "The
        Torture Garden," the 19th Century French novel by Octave Mirbeau,
        accompanied by the dirge of heavy rock music. Serra's passion for
        finding cinematic beauty in the absurd and humor in provocation make her
        work charming, singular and visceral.</image:caption
