        >The assassination of Pancho Villa, on the outskirts of Parral,
        Chihuahua, plunged the city into mourning, and a wake for the
        revolutionary hero was held by his closest collaborators. Conspicuous
        among the mourners were the four women with whom Villa was having
        intimate relationships at the time of his death. Now that Villa is no
        longer around to mediate and keep them apart, tensions between the women
        grow and intensify, with unexpected consequences. An intimate and human
        portrait of the Centaur of the North.</image:caption
