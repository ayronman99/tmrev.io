        >Tai Chi (Francis Ng), who is from a tiny Chinese village, moves to
        Western Central Hong Kong - the big city - with ambitions of becoming a
        private detective. In his new flat, he discovers 99 unopened letters
        with their stamps cut. He reads them and discovers they are for his
        beautiful neighbor Lok To from her boyfriend Gala in France...but for
        some reason she has never received any of them. Unable to tell Lok To
        that he has read such intimate letters, he decides to try and help
        reunite the lovers in another way...He buys the nearby bakery and hires
        her as an assistant. Things get complicated when he begins to fall for
        Lok To himself, and Gala returns from France with another
        woman.</image:caption
