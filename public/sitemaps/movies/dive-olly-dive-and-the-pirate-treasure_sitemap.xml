        >Submarines Olly and Beth join their friend Bobsie, who is convinced he
        is the great-grandson of the Rainbow “Pie-Rats”, to search for the
        legendary secret treasure that reflects the beautiful rainbows in the
        sky. Their exciting treasure hunt is filled with wonder, comedy, thrills
        and adventure. But, they are followed by the unscrupulous Snarky
        Sharkskin and his slippery seahorse gang. As resourceful as ever, Olly
        and Beth manage to overcome all the problems they encounter, survive the
        storms at sea, make a heroic rescue, and find the glittering rainbow
        treasure. However, in the end, the treasure hunt leads them to
        understand that the best treasure of all is family and
        friendship.</image:caption
