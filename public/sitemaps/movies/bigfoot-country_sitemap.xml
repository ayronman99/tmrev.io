        >Some say Bigfoot is just a hoax but when a group of hikers go deep into
        the woods after being warned by a guide that has encountered a
        Sasquatch, they decide to ignore him and go off trail, but the deeper
        the go into the woods they realize that they are not alone. Becoming
        hysterical as night falls, the group is terrorized to their core and
        accidentally shoots and wounds a Sasquatch. Legend says the Bigfoot
        species simply want to be left alone but when provoked, they will
        protect their territory and in this case the damage has been done and
        there is no turning back.</image:caption
