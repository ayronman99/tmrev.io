        >Maureen has her hands full at home and can't take care of her father
        William, who may be suffering from Alzheimer's. Her brothers - Alun, an
        alcoholic trumpet player, and John, an insensitive businessman - don't
        really want to help. William, a lifelong socialist, feels angry and
        resentful towards the British government which has abandoned him in his
        old age. Having been persuaded by his children to buy a council house in
        the booming 80s, he discovers that this selfsame government, which made
        such a virtue of home ownership some ten years earlier, now expects him
        to sell the property in order to pay for his care. Isolated in old age,
        Williams secretly decides to put into action a plan to get back at the
        system.</image:caption
