        >"Greater is the hatred that has inspired us, than the sea that
        separates us from it" reads one of the most significant sentences of
        Simón Bolívar's Letter of Jamaica. The work revolves around this phrase,
        whose words appear and disappear in the course of the sequence of
        images, disjointed from the cohesion that brings them together only at
        the end of the video to form that programmatic declaration that defends
        independence. The sentence is thus evidenced as a procedural symbolic
        knot, the result of a complex history and its possible articulations.
        The images of the video, in a constant swaying of a boat in the water,
        open up to the dimensions of the immensity of that sea that serves
        Bolivar as a metaphorization of the magnitude of the hatred that forces
        him to revolt against the colonizers. It is a sea in which is inscribed,
        in turn, a new history, which, as a possible reading, forces us to think
        of other colonizations and economic dependencies.</image:caption
