        >A multi disciplinary film and photographic art project created by
        Yankunytjatjara artist Derik Lynch and Australian artist Matthew Thorne
        that explores (in dream and memory) Derik's childhood growing up in the
        heart of central Australia. The story follows his road trip from the
        oppression of white city life in Adelaide back to country - Aputula - to
        perform Drag on sacred Inma ground, while memories from his youth
        return. Inma is a 60,000+ year old form of storytelling using the
        visual, verbal and physical. As a place of storytelling it is also the
        place where the history and stories of the past are written and shared
        in the present.</image:caption
