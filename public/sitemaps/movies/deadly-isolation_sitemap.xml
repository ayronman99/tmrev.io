        >In a quaint and quiet island community off the coast of Maine, Susan is
        a young widow suffering from deep grief for the loss of her husband,
        Ron. Two escaped convicts suffer from their own kind of deep grief at
        the loss of their diamonds stolen in a heist they participated in the
        year before, spear-headed by Susan's now late husband. One of the
        convicts, poses as an old college friend of Ron's enabling him to get
        close to a still vulnerable Susan and even closer to the
        diamonds.</image:caption
