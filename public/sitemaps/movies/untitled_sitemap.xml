        >Emerging from the screenâ€™s blackness, a small image appears at its
        lower edge. A young boy sits in a train clattering out of the station.
        Shortly after that another film image is visible at the upper edge: A
        man catches his wife cheating on him. More and more scenes appear until
        the screen fills with 12 sections. A different film is being shown in
        each one.</image:caption
