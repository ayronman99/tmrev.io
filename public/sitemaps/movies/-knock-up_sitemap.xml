        >1,2,3 Knockup approaches the terrifying symbiotic relationship
        resulting from an unwanted pregnancy as well as the equally terrifying
        symbiotic relationship resulting from a young girl suddenly having her
        own sexuality thrust upon her . In both cases the cohabitation of the
        body is oppressive and unpleasant. Two organisms living with each other
        in a sort of parasitism. The roles of host and parasite however are
        interchanging and ambiguous with one element often presenting itself as
        the other.</image:caption
