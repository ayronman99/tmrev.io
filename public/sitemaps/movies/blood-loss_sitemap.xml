        >Jake Reid's father died in a bloody massacre 15 years ago in Covelo,
        California, after participating in a botched robbery-the loot from which
        was never found. Jake comes to this small western town to dig up the
        past and to dig up the money-he digs too deep. As he uncovers the
        circumstances of his father's death, Jake enlists the help of the
        daughter of a man his father killed, and fends off the town's brutal
        sheriff. But Jake isn't the only one looking to haul away the money.
        Escaped from prison, and on the run, Jake's father's surviving partner
        in crime shows up in town to finally collect his ill-gotten gains. The
        sheriff, the outlaw, the locals and the girl go straight to what they
        know-the gun-and Jake, caught in the crossfire, must decide who's side
        he is on.</image:caption
