        >Prague, 1983. The communist regime, in a suffocating atmosphere ruled
        over by the secret police, imposes "normalization". Miki and David need
        some kind of motivation to carry on in the communist wasteland. They
        discover The Clash's album 'London Calling' and, of course, decide to
        set up a punk band. But playing punk during normalization in
        Czechoslovakia isn't the best idea, an opinion shared not only by their
        horrified parents. Many decisions made under the influence of cheap
        alcohol and compulsive music could be more fatal than they initially
        seemed. A story about the revolt of some 18-year-olds against authority,
        against social norms, against adult duties and responsibility. It is
        about the search for one's own models and values. Although based on
        personal experiences from the early 1980s, it could have taken place at
        any time and anywhere, and is more than likely taking place somewhere
        right now.</image:caption
