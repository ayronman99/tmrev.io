        >The girly but bloody otome game re-imagining of Lewis Carroll's classic
        fantasy novel Alice's Adventures in Wonderland with bishounen characters
        and added romance. A parody of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland where
        Alice is smart and non-doormatlike. In this story, Alice is not all what
        she seems. She is practical, strong, yet darkly cynical. Instead of the
        tradition story, Alice is kidnapped unwillingly by a mysterious (yet
        somewhat bishie-looking) man with bunny ears into a place call
        Heartland. Stuck in Heartland due to a trick by the mysterious bunny
        eared man, she meets the residents of this world. Along the way, Alice
        meets Blood, handsome mafia leader; Ace, the psycho yet charming knight
        and moreâ€¦What should Alice do in such a world!? (Source: Manga
