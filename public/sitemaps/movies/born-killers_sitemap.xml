        >John and Michael are taught by their father at a young age that people
        are merely piggy banks... if you need money, just break one open.
        Charming and brilliant, they roam the country robbing and murdering
        anyone foolish enough to get in the car with them. After their
        partnership becomes strained and John sets off on his own, he discovers
        his father had a secret family... another wife and a daughter in another
        state. With a renewed sense of purpose he sets out to find and kill his
        stepsister. But this may be more challenging than he thinks... has he
        met his match?</image:caption
