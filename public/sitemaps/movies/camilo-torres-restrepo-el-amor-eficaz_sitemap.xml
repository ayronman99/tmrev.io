        >An experimental documentary that dares to gather diverse and plural
        audiovisual archive materials, which gives itself the possibility of
        creating an imaginary, but concrete, intense and profound conversation
        between the filmmaker Marta Rodr√≠guez and the indefinable Camilo Torres
        Restrepo. A film that invents the opportunity to talk to a dead man, why
        yes, Camilo died, but his questions, his ideas and his effective love
        remain strong and powerful within Marta's life and political and
        artistic reflection. Who was Camilo Torres Restrepo? The documentary
        tries to answer this question by looking at Colombia today, analyzing
        it, and understanding it, perhaps a little more, in its inequalities and
        its constant violence. Perhaps this is the greatest legacy that Camilo
        left to those who are still alive.</image:caption
