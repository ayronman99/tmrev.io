        >Gehr uses a mini-digital recorder to look back on the Machine Age in
        the form of San Francisco's soon-to-be-shuttered Musee Mecanique. For
        slightly more than an hour, Cotton Candy documents this venerable
        collection of coin-operated mechanical toys—including an entire
        circus—mainly in close-up, isolating particular details as he alternates
        between ambient and post-dubbed (or no) sound. By treating the Musee's
        cast of synchronized figures as puppets, the artist is making a show—but
        is it his or theirs? Gehr's selective take on the arcade renders it all
        the more spooky. There's a sense in which Cotton Candy is a gloss on the
        moment in The Rules of the Game when the music-box-collecting viscount
        unveils his latest and most elaborate acquisition. (It also brings to
        mind the climax of A.I.: The DV of the future tenderly regards the more
        human machine of the past.) (J. Hoberman, The Village
        Voice)</image:caption
