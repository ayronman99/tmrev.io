        >“It was on Foula, the furthest island from the main island [Shetland
        Isles], that we ran into Jovan. Or rather he ran into us, coming off the
        ferry late in the day. The mist was thick and we looked worn-out. He
        took us under his wing and offered to show us around the island the
        following day. There is a long sequence shot of the passing scenery,
        taken from inside his car. Driving along the only road, Jovan pointed
        out to Vincent the island’s disarray: abandoned cars and tractors, heaps
        of rusting scrap metal. Then on another island, Papa Stour, with a view
        of Foula, we filmed what was to become the first part of the
        film.”</image:caption
