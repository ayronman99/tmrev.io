        >Jack is an executive in a financial brokerage firm trying to impress
        the firm’s president, Drew Clayton, in hopes of a promotion. However,
        Jack is dating the fabulously rich and elegant Demi Clayton, who happens
        to be Drew’s daughter. Although Demi’s mother Clarisse doesn’t
        necessarily approve of Jack and would prefer her daughter to date a man
        within their social circle, Jack still plans on proposing. Trying to
        create the perfect proposal, Jack signs up for dance lessons in
        preparation for his proposal to Demi at her father’s lavish annual
        Christmas Dance. But when sparks start to fly between Jack and his dance
        instructor, Christine, Jack will have to make some important decisions
        before it is too late.</image:caption
