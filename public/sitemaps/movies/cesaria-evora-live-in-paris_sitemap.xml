        >Singer Cesaria Evora is the cultural ambassador and greatest star of
        her native country, Cape Verde, a former Portuguese colony off the
        Northwestern coast of Africa. She excels at the highly stylized and
        emotionally intense ballad style known as the "morna," a melodramatic,
        mournful romantic music that is much like the Portuguese fado, full of
        beautiful, melancholy guitars and impassioned lyrics of love lost and
        life both savored and endured. For those of us unlucky enough to be
        unable to attend any of her concerts, here is a splendid presentation of
        Cesaria and her band, recorded live at the Zenith Theatre in Spring of
        2001.</image:caption
