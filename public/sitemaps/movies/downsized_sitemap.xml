        >Ebony and Michael were forced into a modern "shotgun" wedding after
        becoming teenage parents, putting their personal goals on hold in order
        to support their family. Amazingly, the two high school sweethearts
        managed to overcome the odds and establish a seemingly ideal life for
        themselves. However, the success that initially was meant to strengthen
        their family has become the very thing that is driving them apart. As a
        result, Michael desperately tries to hold onto everything he's worked
        his entire life to gain. This leads the family on an unconventional
        adventure to restore the faith, hope, and trust that initially brought
        them together.</image:caption
