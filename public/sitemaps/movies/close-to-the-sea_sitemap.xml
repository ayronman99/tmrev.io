        >10-channel video installation. Sound by Jin Wang. A concert is being
        staged at the seaside. Accompanied by various musical instruments, the
        love story of a young couple is unfolded on the same location. The
        videos set on the centre display two scenarios taking place
        simultaneously: one shows a young couple riding a horse along the sea
        and the other a pair of lovers struggling for survival from a ship
        accident. The other eight screens deliver at the same time the
        performance of diverse instruments, a trumpet and a cello played on the
        rocks, for example. The background music, which is hallucinatory,
        dreamlike and even uncoordinated, reflects the conflicts between ideals
        and reality. The young lovers, despite the threat of death, continue
        with their discussion of ideal, faith and anticipation.</image:caption
