        >Maher addresses contemporary political, social and cultural topics --
        Iraq, President Bush and the so called Axis of Evil. The opinionated
        Maher said about Victory Begins at Home: "We've heard everything about
        the War on Terrorism except what we can actually do to help win it. The
        government used to do that for us through propaganda (the positive kind)
        posters, so taking my cue from the great old posters of World War I and
        World War II ('Loose Lips Sink Ships,' 'Buy War Bonds,' 'Plant a Victory
        Garden,' etc.) I commissioned artists to paint the posters our
        government today should be putting out to help us win this
        war."</image:caption
