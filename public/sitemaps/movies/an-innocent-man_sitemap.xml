        >Jimmie Rainwood was minding his own business when two corrupt police
        officers (getting an address wrong) burst into his house, expecting to
        find a major drug dealer. Rainwood is shot, and the officers frame him
        as a drug dealer. Rainwood is convicted of drug dealing, based on the
        perjured evidence of a police informant. Thrown into a seedy jail,
        fighting to prove his innocence is diffucult when he has to deal with
        the realities of prison life, where everyone claims they were
        framed.</image:caption
