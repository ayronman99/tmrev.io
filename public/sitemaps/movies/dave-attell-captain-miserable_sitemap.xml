        >Dave Attell is funnier and more outlandish than ever in his first solo
        HBO, special, a 60-minute concert performed in front of a live audience
        at The Lincoln Theater, the venerable Washington DC venue. Attell's
        sarcastic wit and quick-fire delivery prove why he has earned the
        reputation as a "comic's comic" and was dubbed one of the"25 Funniest
        People in America" by Entertainment Weekly. His decidedly adult brand of
        comedy covers everything including alcohol consumption, dating current
        events and celebrities, and everything else on his mind.</image:caption
