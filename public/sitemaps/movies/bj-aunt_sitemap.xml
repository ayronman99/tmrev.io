        >Before he goes back to school, Sang-woo moves in with his aunt who gets
        divorced from his uncle who she's been having problems with for her
        carefree ways. One day, Sang-woo comes across an adult broadcasting
        application called Bong-al TV and sees his aunt under the name 'BJ
