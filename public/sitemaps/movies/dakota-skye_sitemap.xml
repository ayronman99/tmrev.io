        >For as long as she could remember, Dakota Skye has been cursed with a
        super power. She has the ability to see the truth in any lie she hears.
        From small, harmless white lies, to the more devious kind, they have
        come from the people that she should trust the most; her family, friends
        and teachers. These lies have snowballed, leading to her becoming bitter
        and apathetic towards the world around her.</image:caption
