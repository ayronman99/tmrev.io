        >A parable of the missteps of life enacted in the hothouse world of late
        1980’s New York, in which the art market and the stock market each
        boomed, and in process spawned a smorgasbord of “yuppie” delusions which
        still persist. Anna, a French actress studying in New York, crosses
        paths with a successful stock-broker, Mark, standing before a Vermeer
        portrait at the Metropolitan, thence ensues a peculiar romance of missed
        meanings and connections, with tangential asides to the steaming arts
        world and stock market, loft-mate conflicts, and, perhaps, love. Wrapped
        up in their blindered worlds, Anna and Mark deflect away from their
        chances, leaving at the conclusion the wistful face of Vermeer’s
        portrait enigmatically asking questions. All the Vermeers in New York is
        a comedy of manners which, as gently as a Vermeer, looks beneath the
        skin of this time and place, and of these characters.</image:caption
