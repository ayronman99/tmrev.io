        >An apparently simple adultery case turns into an intricate and
        suspense-filled plot composed of numerous twists and turns, with a
        surprising ending. Dr. Rafidjian, a renowned physician, seeks out Dora
        Lobo's detective agency, wishing to locate call girl Ana Cíntia Lopes.
        The case soon finds its way into the hands of Remo Bellini and his new
        assistant Beatriz; but the client's brutal murder changes the course of
        the investigation, leading the two detectives into high-risk situations.
        Trying to solve the crime, they canvas the nightlife of São Paulo's
        underworld, where they meet Fátima, a mysterious prostitute who becomes
        involved with Bellini. Based on the book of the same title by the writer
        and musician Tony Bellotto, who is also the film's co-producer and
        co-composer of the soundtrack, along with Charles Gavin, fellow member
        of the rock band Titãs, and Andreas Kiesser, of
        Sepultura.</image:caption
