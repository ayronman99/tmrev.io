        >Ten years ago Hurricane Katrina devastated the coast of Louisiana. Five
        years later the Deepwater Horizon exploded and spilled more than 200
        million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, the worst ecologic
        disaster in North American history. Amazingly those aren't the worst
        things facing Louisiana's coastline today. It is that the state is fast
        disappearing. When on Earth Day 2010 BP's Deepwater Horizon exploded and
        sank many in Louisiana predicted it would change the state's coastline
        forever, both its economy and its people. How has the coast changed in
        the past five years?</image:caption
