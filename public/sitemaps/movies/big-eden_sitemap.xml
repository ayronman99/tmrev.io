        >Henry Hart is a young gay artist living in New York City. When his
        grandfather has a stroke, Henry puts his career on hold and returns home
        to the small town of Big Eden, Montana, to care for him. While there,
        Henry hopes to strike up a romance with Dean Stewart, his high-school
        best friend for whom he still has feelings. But he's surprised when he
        finds that Pike, a quiet Native American who owns the local general
        store, may have a crush on him.</image:caption
