        >Ali, Kwita, Omar and Boubker are street kids. The daily dose of glue
        sniffing represents their only escape from reality. Since they left Dib
        and his gang, they have been living on the portside of Casablanca. They
        live in constant fear of Dib's revenge. Ali wants to become a sailor -
        when he was living with his mother, a prostitute, he used to listen to a
        fairy tale about the sailor who discovered the miracle island with two
        suns. Instead of finding his island in the dream, Ali and his friends
        are confronted with Dib's gang. Matters are getting
        serious.</image:caption
