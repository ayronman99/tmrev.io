        >Nora Danish headlines the film as the lead actress in "Bencinta", which
        is actually derived from the words "benci" and "cinta" in Malay,
        translated to hate and love, respectively. The film tells the story of a
        newly wedded couple whose relationship sours when Faizal, the rich
        husband, begins having affairs and turns abusive. Trapped in the
        destructive marriage due to conservative societal values, Fathia runs
        away to Langkawi and takes refuge with her best friend. Before they
        realise it, the two fall in love, but Fathia first has to deal with her
        husband.</image:caption
