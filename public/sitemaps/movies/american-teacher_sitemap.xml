        >As the debate over the state of America's public school system rages
        on, one thing everyone agrees on is the need for great teachers. Yet,
        while research proves that teachers are the most important school factor
        in a child's future success, America's teachers are so woefully
        underpaid that almost a third must divide their time between a second
        job in order to make a living. Chronicling the stories of four teachers
        in different areas of the country, American Teacher reveals the
        frustrating realities of today's educators, the difficulty of attracting
        talented new teachers, and why so many of our best teachers feel forced
        to leave the profession altogether. But this wake-up call to our
        system's failings also looks at possibilities for reform. Can we
        re-value teaching in the United States and turn it into a prestigious,
        financially attractive and competitive profession? With almost half of
        American teachers leaving the field in the next five years, now is the
        time to find out.</image:caption
