        >In 15-years the Black Mafia Family, or BMF as they were called, made
        close to 300 million dollars trafficking cocaine from Atlanta to Los
        Angeles. In the Hip-Hop music industry they created a front company
        called BMF Entertainment, which was a perfect mix of drugs, violence,
        and street cred that makes their story Hip-Hop's version of the
        Godfather. This film explores the story of the 15-year investigation by
        the DEA, FBI and an elite drug task force called HIDTA, which resulted
        in 41 defendants across the country being charged in one of the largest
        drug conspiracy cases ever.</image:caption
