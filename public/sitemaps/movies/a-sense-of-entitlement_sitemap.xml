        >Art student Jessica and her half-sister model Caroline are told by
        their wealthy father Mr. Blaine that he has decided to financially cut
        off both of them. This causes the two women to re-evaluate their lives.
        Jessica must figure out what is most important to her: family, boyfriend
        Albert or her studies. Caroline must learn independence for the first
        time in her life. As Mr. Blaine and his assistant Benton arrive in town
        to confront Jessica and Caroline, his decision will forever alter their
        lives and their relationships to one another.</image:caption
