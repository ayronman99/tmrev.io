        >Advocate Anand Mathur draws up a will for his client, while reading the
        novel "Godfather", and erroneously makes out the will with a provision
        that the beneficiary must be a criminal don in order to inherit the
        billions of rupees. The beneficiary is a bachelor named Rahul Bhargav,
        who wants no part of being a Don, criminal or anything of that sort. His
        Police Inspector girlfriend, Kanchan Dhillon, has set her sights on the
        billions, and makes him change his mind. She assures him that she will
        use her influence and ensure that he gets to be the Don in no time at
        all, little realizing that this will change their lives forever, and
        make them captives in neighbouring and hostile Pakistan.</image:caption
