        professional life of Alan J. Pakula, a lauded filmmaker and extremely

        ranging filmography including To Kill A Mockingbird, Klute, All the
        President's Men, Sophie's Choice, Presumed Innocent, and The Pelican

        while family and friends share their memories of knowing him as an
        artist, a husband, and a stepfather.</image:caption
