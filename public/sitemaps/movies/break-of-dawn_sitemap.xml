        >In 2038, Yuuma Sawatari is an elementary school kid who loves
        everything about space and astronomy. He was initially excited when his
        parents bought a robot called Nanako, but he was disappointed when he
        learned that she was basically just a boring housekeeping robot.
        However, when he does finally try to talk to her about space, something
        strange happens. Her system crashes and is taken over by what claims to
        be a marooned alien ship! The alien ship wants Yuuma's help to get back
        to space!</image:caption
