        >During the 1920's, Augusto San Miguel (1905-1937) directed, produced
        and starred in the first feature films made in Ecuador. Unfortunately,
        San Miguel's films -like many episodes of his life- disappeared in time.
        The only remains are the movie ads on old newspapers and a mysterious
        legend, by which San Miguel was buried with his films.</image:caption
