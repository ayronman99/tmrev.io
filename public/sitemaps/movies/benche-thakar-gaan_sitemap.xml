        >Benche Thakar Gaan is set in an old age home where Paromita, a young
        gerontologist lands up leaving a lucrative career as a psychiatrist in
        the city. In this home, she faces her boss Dr. Partho Sinha, a strict
        disciplinarian, who has built this home for all those who can afford to
        live well but are not able to live either with their families or alone
        due to certain circumstances. According to Dr. Sinha, the inmates are
        here to spend the sunset years of their lives in peacebut Paromita feels
        otherwise, she believes there is still a lot to live for in the sunset
        years too. To Paromita, even the seniors have a right to enjoy, and
        peace can only come when the mind is happy - - An old age home is not
        where you are thrown out, but it can be a home where new bonds can be
        forged even in later years of life. Benche Thakar Gaan or song of life
        is a positive look at the age which to us is just a number, and its all
        in the mind.</image:caption
