        >John Berger is one of our most celebrated and respected writers and
        broadcasters. A former winner of the Booker Prize, he also wrote one of
        the most influential books on art of our time, Ways of Seeing, which
        became a landmark documentary series on BBC Television. In Ken
        McMullen's engaging and accessible film, Art, Poetry and Particle
        Physics, he travels to the world's biggest particle physics laboratory
        at CERN in Geneva. The film charts an extraordinary and wide-ranging
        series of discussions and collaborations between Berger and the leading
        theoretical and experimental physicists John March Russell and Michael
        Doser.</image:caption
