        >Vito is a bartender from Pegognaga, a small apparently anti-tourist
        town that in winter is obliterated by the fog and in summer by the heat.
        As a joke between friends, he ends up getting stuck between two concrete
        columns placed in front of his bar. However, the joint is so perfect
        that no one is able to free it anymore. The mayor arrives with the
        brigade, then the ASL nurses, the firefighters, but there is nothing to
        be done: Ciccio gets stuck and demolition projects are even made that
        arouse the terror of the tenants of the building. The only possible
        evolution of the story is that Ciccio, now known by all as
        "Cicciocolonna", gets stuck between the columns and becomes "a
        coincidence". In fact, the TV that spreads the news arrives:
        Cicciocolonna becomes a point of reference for the whole country. A kind
        of living monument, but also a sort of essay to which people go to ask
        for advice and even the numbers to play the lottery.</image:caption
