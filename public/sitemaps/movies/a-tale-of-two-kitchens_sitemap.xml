        >Two countries, two restaurants, one vision. At Gabriela Cámara's
        acclaimed Contramar in Mexico City, the welcoming, uniformed waiters are
        as beloved by diners as the menu featuring fresh, local seafood caught
        within 24 hours. The entire staff sees themselves as part of an extended
        family. Meanwhile at Cala in San Francisco, Cámara hires staff from
        different backgrounds and cultures, including ex-felons and ex-addicts,
        who view the work as an important opportunity to grow as individuals. A
        Tale of Two Kitchens explores the ways in which a restaurant can serve
        as a place of both dignity and community.</image:caption
