        >Driss is a jack-of-all trades type who sells fish from his car and
        moves furniture from one end of his hometown Tangiers to the other. His
        girlfriend is a free-spirited and wealthy European lass who runs an
        antique shop. One day, Driss becomes fascinated with Fouad, an old man
        who runs a rundown café by the beach. Fouad disdains his fellow
        Moroccans, calling them lazy, preferring the company of Europeans --
        particularly, as Driss later learns -- young European women. Always on
        the make, Driss offers Fouad a business proposition -- to revamp his
        establishment and turn it into a proper restaurant with Driss as his
        business partner. He is later shocked and hurt to learn that Fouad
        starts to remodel his business but without Driss. Sending out his
        friends as spies, Driss learns a number of unsettling things about his
        would-be associate.</image:caption
