        >Paul's dad unexpectedly picked him up from work today. And then a
        hooker. After dropping them off at a seedy roadside motel, Paul's father
        handed him two hundred dollars and told him not to come out until he's a
        man. These are just a few of the bizarre, sexually charged events that
        Paul recounts to Marco, a charming and seductive hustler he meets in a
        dicey bar on a hidden street underneath New York City's infamous Port
        Authority Bus Terminal, an area officially named but rarely referred to
        as "Area X". It is here in this dark and shady place that Paul must
        navigate his way through what he wants, what he needs, and the high cost
        attached to both.</image:caption
