        >An advocate of sex, but not of marriage, bachelor Daegyu (played by
        singer-turned-actor Im Changjeon), 26, produces bootleg music albums for
        a living. One day, he comes across a plucky, nine-year-old boy named
        Jeon Ingwon (played by Lee Inseong) who insists that he is Daegyu's son
        born out of wedlock. Daegyu tries every possible means to send the bold
        boy back to where he came from, including reporting him to the police,
        deserting him on the street and even pretending not to have known him,
        but to no avail. Ingwon makes an offer to Daegyu: he will leave him
        forever if they first travel across the country together. During the
        journey, Daegyu comes to learn Ingwon's secret and finds a reason not to
        continue their cross-land journey.</image:caption
