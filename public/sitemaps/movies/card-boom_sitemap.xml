        >Cheng Sanhe, the first "Kanu" who successfully filed for bankruptcy in
        Taiwan, went from being inexplicably indebted at the beginning to
        realizing that he had already owed millions of debts. The bank's
        collection and the finance company used threats and intimidation to
        collect debts. Sanhe has since fallen into the hell of "using cards to
        raise cards". Taiwan’s first "card god" Yang Huiru, who successfully
        profited from banks with bonus points, used the loopholes in bank
        bonuses to successfully connect relatives and friends to purchase
        tickets or shopping station goods by swiping cards, and then use online
        auctions to earn the difference. Earning millions in the bank, the bank
        stopped using credit cards. Yang Huiru, who has also experienced
        personal pain, persuaded the card slaves to face reality: "Hurry up and
        cut off the card! Because the interest is too heavy, don’t think about
        borrowing another cash card to pay off the card debt. It’s getting
        deeper and deeper."</image:caption
