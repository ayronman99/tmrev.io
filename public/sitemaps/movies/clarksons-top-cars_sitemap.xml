        >This video continued the trend of its predecessors, with Clarkson
        driving some super cars around a track and destroying a "bad" one, this
        time around a Morris Marina, which he disposes of by hooking up to a
        crane and knocking down a few other despised cars in a giant game of Car
        Skittles. Elsewhere the video focuses on Clarkson's personal top 100
        cars, which he promoted on Granada Television's Men & Motors channel in
        2001.</image:caption
