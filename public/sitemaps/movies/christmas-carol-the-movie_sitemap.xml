        >Animated version of the classic Charles Dickins story. Warned by the
        ghost of his old business partner Marley that his sins would lead to
        punishment in the afterlife, the cruel and greedy Scrooge is visited by
        the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Future to show him how the
        course of his life led him to where he is - and where it will lead if he
        doesn't change his ways.</image:caption
