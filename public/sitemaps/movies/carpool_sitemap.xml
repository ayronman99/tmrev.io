        >A man with an important business meeting finds himself having to take
        care of the carpool for the neighborhood school children when his wife
        gets sick. Stopping to get donuts for the kids, things go even more awry
        when he finds himself a victim of a robbery. However, the situation only
        gets worse as a desperate man who had been contemplating a bank robbery
        robs the robbers and takes the man and the kids hostage in their van as
        his truck is blocked by an armored car. The thing then proceeds into a
        comedic chase movie. The father finds his kids don't really respect him
        and they react better to the robber. The end result is everyone gets a
        lifestyle change, including the original store owner.</image:caption
