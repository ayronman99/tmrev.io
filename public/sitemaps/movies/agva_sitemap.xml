        >A small border town in the south of Slovakia is surprised by the sudden
        arrival of respected builder Mr. Hampl and his young wife Nada. She
        catches the eye of an equally young local teacher, Daniel, who is still
        recovering from his military experience in The Second World War. At
        first, Nada tries to resist Daniel's charm but her decision is
        complicated by the scent of flowering agave in the hot summer air. When
        the agave after 30 years of sleep finally blooms, Nada's primary
        decision not to give in is permanently void... A simple love story on
        the surface opens into to a deep, psychological study set in the hot
        summer of 1947. The Second World War has just ended and the Communist
        coup is waiting in the wings to wipe nearly a whole generation of Slovak
        intelligentsia from the history.</image:caption
