        >Greg founded a company called Alibi.com that creates any type of alibi.
        With his associate, Augustin, and Medhi his new employee, they devise
        unstoppable stratagems and stagings to cover their clients. But meeting
        Flo, a pretty blonde who hates men who lie, will complicate Greg's life,
        which begins by hiding the true nature of his activity. During the
        presentation to parents, Greg understands that GÃ©rard, the father of
        Flo, is also one of their clients.</image:caption
