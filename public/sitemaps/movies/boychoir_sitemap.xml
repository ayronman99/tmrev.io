        >A troubled and angry 11-year-old orphan from a small Texas town, ends
        up at a Boy Choir school after the death of his single mother.
        Completely out of his element, he finds himself in a battle of wills
        with a demanding Choir Master who recognises a unique talent in this
        young boy as he pushes him to discover his creative heart and soul in
        music.</image:caption
