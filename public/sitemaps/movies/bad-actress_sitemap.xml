        >A Latin socialite decides to become the anti Sophia Vergara. As we
        watch her whirlwind of destruction take down everyone and everything in
        her wake as she makes Scarface look like a family movie. As the reign of
        destruction and the dust clears, we see our heroine in her first
        audition as "She Kills It"! Nothing is as it seems in this sexy
        blockbuster comedy with a surprise ending.</image:caption
