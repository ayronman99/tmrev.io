        >Musicologist, Dr Ahmad Sarmast, son of famous Afghan musician Ustad
        Salim Sarmast, returns to Kabul after 15 years to reopen the old music
        school, closed down by Islamic extremists in 1992, with the dream to
        transform it into Afghanistan's first national institute of music.
        Determined to help revitalise his country's devastated music culture,
        Ahmad also has a personal quest: to give Kabul's street kids and orphans
        the chance to go to the music school, believing that the healing power
        of music will transform their lives.</image:caption
