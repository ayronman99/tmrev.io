        >Ram (Viju Khote) and Shaam (Anand Abhyankar) are business partners who
        have an unusual habit to bet with each other on human tendencies.
        According to Ram, a human tends to behave as per the situation around
        him, whereas Shaam believes that no matter what the situation is, it
        cannot change the core of human's nature.For a small bet, they create
        situations where in their honest, successful employee Vaibhav (Sachin
        Pilgaonkar) is forced to see a world of poverty, whereas, a laid back
        beggar named Chandu (Ashok Saraf) gets to live a life of a rich
        businessman. Vaibhav realizes the true value of humanity while Chandu
        comes across the lack of humanity in high society.Eventually Chandu and
        Vaibhav learn about the bet. They decide to even the scores by teaching
        Ram and Shaam a lesson in their own ways. Will the rich duo realize
        their wrong doings.</image:caption
