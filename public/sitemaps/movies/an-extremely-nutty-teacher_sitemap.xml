        >After studying in the capital, the young Cate, 18, returns to her small
        town in Minas Gerais, to teach in elementary school. Enthusiastic, free
        and communicative, she conquers the students in the act, but its leading
        behavior does not appeal to conservative teachers of the 40s. Every day
        she brings new ideas. While they discover the pleasure of learning, the
        school friends also have the first lessons about love, friendship and
        freedom. And the schoolmistress not only winning students: the most
        beautiful boys in town fall in love with her. Created by Tia Cida and
        niece of Bishop Aristides, Cate grew up with his uncle's godson, Beto,
        who became a priest and return to the city after studying
        outside.</image:caption
