        >The Boys' Village was once a village-style holiday camp located in West
        Aberthaw, on the south coast of Wales. Built in the 1920s as a holiday
        home for Welsh coalminers' sons, boasting a pool, sports yards and even
        a chapel of its own. Not much remains of its former glory, though.
        Shattered glass and debris are all over the place; graffiti on the
        walls. There are countless trap falls and opportunities for injury. A
        parent's nightmare, it can be heaven on earth for a certain kind of
        child. It more or less is for Kevin. He has been eleven years old for
        quite some time now. Has it been years or decades?</image:caption
