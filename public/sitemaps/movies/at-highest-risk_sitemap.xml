        >Just as the rivers of the Andes mountains twist and coil in a curious
        maze, so does the grave situation of Peruvian women's health care.
        Through the compelling story of one Andean woman, Judyth Aguero Vega, we
        see the horrors and triumphs of Peru's volatile health care situation.
        Inside a small adobe kitchen, Elsa Romero-Murrado, a midwife in the
        rural town of Capacmarca, takes us through rarely seen birthing
        ceremonies. Down the dirt path, her neighbor Judyth, 27, shares her
        fears of birth as she bestrides the lines of modern and traditional
        medicine. Their town sits seven hours from the nearest hospital. Cerlia
        Mendoza, president of the Mother's Club, testifies to a list of 200
        women who were bribed by doctors to undergo
        sterilization.</image:caption
