        >A shocking crime forces a man to re-evaluate his life, only to find
        that going straight is more complicated than he imagined. Ali is a
        low-level criminal who spends much of his spare time working out at a
        gym with his brother Pulu. Ali spends most of his day stoned on
        marijuana, while Pulu is known to drink cleaning products when he's run
        out of booze. Ali has fallen in love with Inka, a bright woman with a
        mind of her own, and her independent nature occasionally throws him into
        a fit of jealousy.</image:caption
