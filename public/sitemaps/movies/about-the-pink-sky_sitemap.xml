        >High school student Izumi Kawashima, whose daily routine is rating
        newspaper articles, finds a wallet containing a large sum of cash.
        Instead of returning the wallet to its owner, Izumi decides to lend a
        substantial portion of the money to a middle-aged male acquaintance. She
        eventually returns the wallet to its owner, a wealthy high-school boy
        named Koki, who notices the missing money, and as compensation, asks
        Izumi to do something for his friend â€“ to create a newspaper that brings
        happiness to its reader.</image:caption
