        >CONFESSIONS OF A SUPERHERO is a feature length documentary chronicling
        the lives of three mortal men and one woman who make their living
        working as superhero characters on the sidewalks of Hollywood Boulevard.
        This deeply personal view into their daily routines reveals their
        hardships, and triumphs, as they pursue and achieve their own kind of
        fame. The Hulk sold his Super Nintendo for a bus ticket to LA; Wonder
        Woman was a mid-western homecoming queen; Batman struggles with his
        anger, while Supermanâ€™s psyche is consumed by the Man of Steel. Although
        the Walk of Fame is right beneath their feet, their own paths to stardom
        prove to be a long, hard climbs.</image:caption
