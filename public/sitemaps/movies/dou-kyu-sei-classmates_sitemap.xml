        >Rihito Sajo, an honor student with a perfect score on the entrance exam
        and Hikaru Kusakabe, in a band and popular among girls, would have never
        crossed paths. Until one day they started talking at the practice for
        their school’s upcoming chorus festival. After school, the two meet
        regularly, as Hikaru helps Rihito to improve his singing skills. While
        they listen to each other’s voice and harmonize, their hearts start to
        beat together.</image:caption
