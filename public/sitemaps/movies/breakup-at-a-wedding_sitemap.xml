        >On the eve of their wedding, Alison gets cold feet and decides to break
        up with her fianc√© Phil. But rather than face the embarrassment of
        calling off the ceremony, Alison suggests to Phil that they proceed with
        a sham wedding. Phil is more than game to try, secretly hoping that a
        surprise gift he has for Alison will ultimately change her mind. Yet
        once the guests begin to arrive, more complications ensue than either of
        them could have ever imagined - even if they did know their wedding was
        bullshit.</image:caption
