        >"Inflatable" is a raucous, poignant and ultimately uplifting show that
        received five star reviews from Melbourne to Edinburgh, and played to
        sold out audiences across the UK. Adam discusses the intricacies of sign
        language, the politeness of the Dutch, prostate awareness, what it feels
        like to have an "old man rant" and the joy of seeing the Paralympics
        live. Of course, no Adam Hills show is complete without including
        members of the audience, so you'll also see an impromptu boyband, a sex
        toy goody bag and much more. Let Adam Hills inflate you with this
        riotous live show. Joyous. Uplifting. Inflatable.</image:caption
