        >From Klondike to Stampede, Stu Hart's Canadian territory saw many
        changes, more than just in name. There were ups and downs, successes and
        challenges, but Stu built a legacy and a family in front of Calgary
        Stampede Wrestling's backdrop. In this edition of Back to the
        Territories, join Jim Cornette and guest Lance Storm as they delve into
        the history of Stu Hart's territory and the Hart family itself. Go
        inside the Hart Brothers' training camp where Storm was trained and hear
        about the dynamics of the family. Learn the names that built the
        territory and the names that Stu built. There are great stories about
        legends like Archie Goulding and the Dynamite Kid and their roles in
        Calgary. Head up north and add Calgary to your scholarly trek through
        wrestling's great territories with the always entertaining and
        informative Jim Cornette and his guest Lance Storm and head Back...to
        the Territories!</image:caption
