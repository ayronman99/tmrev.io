        >About 25 years ago an unholy child was born in an ancient noble family.
        The parents were the mother and son of the family. The goal was to
        create the perfect daughter, but instead she gave birth to a monster!
        The son, whose only interest are rabbits, called the monster Bunny Man,
        and placed him in a hole in the woods. He supplied his son with food and
        rabbits, to play with. Unfortunately, the lack of human contact made him
        violent, and his rabbits died when during his so called games. One day
        the son forgets to lock the hole and Bunny Man suddenly finds himself
        free, in a world he's never seen and doesn't understand. At the same
        time, a group of kids arrive at a cabin in the woods to throw a party.
        Kids that, to an untrained eye, seem quite similar to
        rabbits...</image:caption
