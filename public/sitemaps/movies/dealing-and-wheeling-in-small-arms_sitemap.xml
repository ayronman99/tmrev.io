        >DEALING AND WHEELING IN SMALL ARMS is a political documentary on the
        uncontrolled widespread of small arms, which rule and ruin the lives of
        a growing number of people in developing countries. Through the eyes of
        different experts whose lives depend on small arms, the film shows the
        causes and impact of the trade—both legal, 'grey' and illegal—in small
        arms and its ammunitions, in particular in regions where the European
        Union and the United Nations are active, such as former Yugoslavia and
        Congo. Especially interesting for the western audience, the film shows
        how brokers—often under some 'organized' legal cover—buy weapons
        collected by the EU and NATO during their mission in Bosnia. These
        brokers transfer the weapons directly to African battlefields where they
        continue their killing lifespan unhindered.</image:caption
