        >The suburbs of Padua, in northeast Italy. Flavia, a hairdresser, is
        closing the shop after 43 years of activity. He is 61 years old. He left
        school when he was 11. He made the hairdresser always. He is leaving
        behind a clientele of older women who did hair for years at a rate of
        regular appointments. He knows every single hair of their
        heads.</image:caption
