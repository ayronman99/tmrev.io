        >The story of how the classic album "Paranoid" was made, with stories
        from band members to those who were influenced by its content, form and
        vitality. Paranoid is the second studio album by English rock band Black
        Sabbath. Released in September 1970, it was the band's only LP to top
        the UK Albums Chart until the release of 13 in 2013. Paranoid contains
        several of the band's signature songs, including "Iron Man", "War Pigs"
        and the title track, which was the band's only Top 20 hit, reaching
        number 4 in the UK charts. It is often regarded as one of the most
        quintessential and influential albums in heavy metal
        history.</image:caption
