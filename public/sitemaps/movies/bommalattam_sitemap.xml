        >An investigation is immediately opened up into the alleged death of
        Trishna, who was in the car. CBI suspects Rana of committing planned
        murder. Here enters Vivek Varma, CBI officer who intent in nailing Rana
        with murder. Vivek does have his own agendas though, as his girlfriend,
        an ardent fan of Rana himself, has gone on to join Rana as an assistant,
        and has gradually grown more attached to Rana than she is to Vivek
        himself, causing their relationship to strain. Vivek probes continuously
        to try to convict Rana with murder, as he reveals that two more murders
        took place within his film sets during the shooting of 'Cinema', and
        believes now that Rana is responsible for all three murders.. He hires
        her as his new muse, and in the shooting spot, they are shown to share a
        very intimate relationship, fueling existing rumors that he is a
        womanizer</image:caption
