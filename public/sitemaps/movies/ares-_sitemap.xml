        >Four crew members of a military spacecraft are faced with an
        unfathomable dilemma after their ship is attacked, leaving them only
        enough air for two of them to return to base alive. In a fight for
        survival, each crew member must decide whether they are to accept their
        fate or betray their friends, as tensions rise and the air slowly leaks
        from the crippled spacecraft.</image:caption
