        >The Amityville legend lives on when a resident of a local boarding
        house dies under mysterious circumstances. Her two best friends,
        Brigitta and Bermuda, Bermuda's sister Sentinel, and the owner of the
        boarding house, Ms. Ernie, are absolutely devastated. This is not helped
        by the arrival of an eccentric and crude detective who never takes off
        his cowboy outfit, Hank Denton. Tensions run high as the girls begin to
        suspect their friend Margaret may still be alive; and as the detective's
        behavior becomes more out of control, the house itself may very well be
        turning on it's residents.</image:caption
