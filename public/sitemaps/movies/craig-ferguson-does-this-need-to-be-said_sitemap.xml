        >If you only know Craig Ferguson as host of The Late Late Show or as
        Drew Carey's sitcom boss, you're missing out. The gloriously ribald Scot
        takes to the stage in this all-new comedy special for a night of jokes
        and storytelling peppered with the kinds of words he's not allowed to
        say on network TV. Before a hootin' and hollerin' Nashville audience,
        Ferguson tackles every topic from celebrity sex scandals to booze to his
        own hilarious heavy metal past - all in an accent that makes him sound
        downright refined.</image:caption
