        >Zaid is a successful heart surgeon with an expensive apartment and
        pregnant girlfriend. One night he gets a visit from his brother Yasin,
        who is desperate for money, but he refuses. Soon after, Yasin is found
        beaten to death and Zaid is overcome with guilt. As guilt gives way to
        anger, Zaid becomes a masked avenger and takes on Copenhagen's criminal
        underworld in his quest for justice.</image:caption
