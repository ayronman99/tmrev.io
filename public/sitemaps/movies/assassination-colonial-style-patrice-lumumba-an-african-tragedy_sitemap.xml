        >Patrice Lumumba – the first Prime Minister of the newly independent
        African state, The Congo. To fellow Africans he was a hero – the man who
        had won his country’s independence from the Belgians. But for the secret
        services of the western powers he was a threat. It was at the height of
        the Cold War, when the superpowers of both East and Western blocs were
        competing for spheres of influence in the New Africa. Congo was vital to
        Western interests because of it’s vast mineral resources. The West
        believed Lumumba was pro-soviet and would open the door to communist
        control of this mineral rich region. CIA agent Larry Devlin received
        100,000 dollars from the Agency along with telegraphed instructions to
        make the “elimination of Lumumba” the “priority goal” of his covert
        action.</image:caption
