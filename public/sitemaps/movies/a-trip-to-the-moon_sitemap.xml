        >At fourteen years of age, Tomás is entering adolescence, that time in
        your life in which not only do you have to face physical and emotional
        changes, but in which there are also memories that start taking more
        traumatic forms. That is why he continuously visits a psychiatrist, why
        he acts a bit weird. He is a bit of a hermit, bearing, as much as he
        can, the extreme normalcy of his family, who are dying for summer to
        arrive so they can go to a time share at the beach, while Tomás wants to
        escape… to the moon.</image:caption
