        >There are elements of Eurotrash in this outdoor Aix-en-Provence summer
        opera production. Nevertheless, the splendid singing and acting
        transform the story, normally treated as farce, into something
        considerably more serious. As many other critics have noted, the young
        lovers have not yet sorted everything out as this performance ends. Act
        One begins with the principal characters running around in the outdoor
        theater -- while the audience takes it in as if they had been advised to
        sit back and enjoy the novelty. Very likely they were also asked to
        refrain from applauding at the end of arias and ensemble pieces, in
        which the three-hour opera abounds.</image:caption
