        >Kath, a shy young woman, befriends Bob, the reclusive gardener at a
        seaside hotel where she's getting married. Kath has never come to terms
        with her mother leaving home when she was eight and that her overbearing
        father, Ken, never talks about her. Now she is getting married to
        escape, only to discover that her fianc√©e, Steve, is completely
        dominated by Ken as well. Bob is a gentle, eccentric man with a dry
        sense of humour and a troubled past. He spent a long time in prison and
        in the years he's worked at the hotel he has never ventured beyond the
        gardens, which he tends with obsessive care. Kath sparks a connection to
        an unresolved relationship from Bob's past with a girl called Louise
        which resonates so strongly that he feels compelled to leave the safety
        of the hotel and confront his past.</image:caption
