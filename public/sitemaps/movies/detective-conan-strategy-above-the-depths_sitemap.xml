        >Fifteen years ago in a barren stretch of the Pacific, a cruise ship
        collided with an iceberg and was lost at sea. More than a decade later,
        Hideto Yashiro—a ship engineer—died in a fatal car accident. The
        unlikely connection between these events only comes to light on the
        luxury liner St. Aphrodite during her maiden voyage. Aboard it on a much
        needed vacation, Kogorou Mouri, his daughter Ran, Conan Edogawa, and the
        Detective Boys enjoy a trip provided by Sonoko Suzuki's family. But
        their fun is soon cut short when a game of hide-and-seek leads to
        Sonoko's disappearance.</image:caption
