        >Mariano has three reasons to invite Antonl√≠n Fair to visit Acapulco
        since the last 50 years. The first one because they were his best
        friends during high school, the second one because he has serious
        intentions to find Carmen Madrigal, a woman from Acapulco who was the
        love of his youth, and the third one he rather not say, but it is the
        reason he carries a pistol and three bullets in his
        suitcase.</image:caption
