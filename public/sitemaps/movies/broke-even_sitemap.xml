        >Rambling account of gambling-addicted losers who are aces at making
        supremely stupid decisions struggles to find some relevancy with a
        strained AIDS subplot accenting an unlikely love story. Dot (Kevin
        Corrigan), Lem (Mick Cunningham) and Curry (Michael Lowry) waste their
        time either chugging down brews at the bar or making bad bets. Their
        losing streak only becomes worse when they fall for a blatant scam
        involving insurance settlements for terminally ill AIDS patients. Guys’
        utter blindness to the con unintentionally places aud in a grossly
        superior position to the characters, ruining any hope of sympathy for
        even Dot, whose affair with spontaneously kooky gal Leslie (Elizabeth
        Berridge) lacks one droplet of chemistry. Combining the worst aspects of
        the Cassavetes school of blue-collar Gotham improv with a poorly
        developed narrative that’s as careless as its characters, “Broke Even”
        has little chance of anteing up to the table with the indie big
        boys.</image:caption
