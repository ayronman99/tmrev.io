        >Elvis Martini is in deep shit. His dilapidated Detroit apartment
        building is about to be foreclosed on by the bank; most of his tenants
        are behind on rent; he's in big debt to bookies and his daughter's
        school. He finds some ill-gotten cash in an evicted tenant's apartment
        and it briefly keeps the wolves at bay, but it brings out a bigger wolf,
        one that wants his stolen money back. When his daughter is kidnapped by
        the mysterious menace he's accidentally messed with, Elvis has 24 hours
        to come up with $25K - cash only.</image:caption
