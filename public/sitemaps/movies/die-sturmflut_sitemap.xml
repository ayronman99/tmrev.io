        >Susanne, a meteorologist Hamburg, has detected signs of an incipient
        sea storm that could devastate the city. Although given the alarm, local
        authorities do not listen to their warnings. To ensure the magnitude of
        the tsunami, Susanne decided to move to an oil platform located
        offshore, which verifies that their dire predictions are to become
        reality, as the storm will soon reach the coast, threatening the lives
        of thousands of people.</image:caption
