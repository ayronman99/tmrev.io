        >Documentary about football fans following England in the 2002 World
        Cup. The film is a product of the Hvidovre studios in Denmark,
        headquarters of Lars von Trier's Dogma 95 movement, which applies rigid
        rules to its film making. Every cut, for instance, has to be clearly
        signalled by a fade to black, all shooting is done on location, lighting
        is natural, and there is no additional soundtrack other than that
        recorded on site. The "victim" is allowed a two-minute right of reply at
        the end.</image:caption
