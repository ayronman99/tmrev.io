        >Moody, atmospheric ghost story starring Mason as a retired tradesman
        who purchases an old mansion that has been vacant for 40 years because
        it is believed to be haunted by the spirit of a young woman who had died
        there. Unaware of the mansion's reputation, Mason and his wife Mullen
        move in and hire a young woman, Lockwood, to keep house. Soon after
        Lockwood's arrival, strange things begin to happen in the household, and
        it becomes apparent that she is possessed by the spirit of the dead
        girl, though Mason scoffs at the idea. On death's door and bedridden,
        Lockwood asks for the same doctor who treated the woman who died 40
        years ago. He arrives and treats her. The next morning Lockwood is
        cured, and it is revealed by the police that the doctor's dead body was
        found in his carriage hours before the time Mason claims he arrived to
        see Lockwood. Convinced that not only the ghost of the girl but that of
        the doctor as well entered his home, Mason finally believes in the
        supernatural.</image:caption
