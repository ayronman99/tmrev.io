        >If ever there was an album worthy of inclusion in Eagle Vision’s
        Classic Albums series it is Queen’s breakout release A Night At The
        Opera. Released in 1975, this was not only the band’s first platinum
        album, but also the one that catapulted them into the spotlight as one
        of the biggest rock acts in the world. Now for the first time, fans are
        offered an in-depth look at one of rock music’s seminal records with the
        Classic Albums DVD Queen — The Making Of A Night At The
        Opera.</image:caption
