        >Confessions of a Sociopath is an autobiographical film on digital video
        and Super 8 film, conceived as a real-life version of Beckett’s Krapp’s
        Last Tape. In this film, Joe Gibbons plays a fictionalized version of
        himself as he discovers a roomful of Super 8 footage from his own life,
        detailing events he can no longer recall. This footage shows his earlier
        film experiments, his descent into destructive behavior, and his
        “bottoming out” on drugs and alcohol. At a certain point, the films are
        replaced by random photos, police records, and psychiatric hospital
        records.</image:caption
