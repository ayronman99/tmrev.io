        >Do you know how to turn ordinary water into a billion-dollar business?
        In Switzerland there's a company which has developed the art to
        perfection - Nestlé. This company dominates the global business in
        bottled water. Swiss journalist Res Gehringer has investigated this
        money-making phenomena. Nestlé refused to cooperate, on the pretext that
        it was "the wrong film at the wrong time". So Gehringer went on a
        journey of exploration, researching the story in the USA, Nigeria and
        Pakistan. His journey into the world of bottled water reveals the
        schemes and strategies of the most powerful food and beverage company on
        our planet.</image:caption
