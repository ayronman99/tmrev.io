        >Based on the acclaimed memoir by renowned guitarist Andy Summers, Can’t
        Stand Losing You: Surviving The Police follows Summers’ journey from his
        early days in the psychedelic ‘60s music scene, when he played with The
        Animals, to chance encounters with drummer Stewart Copeland and bassist
        Sting, which led to the formation of a new wave trio, The Police. The
        band’s phenomenal rise and its highly publicized dissolution at the
        height of their fame in the early ’80s captured by Summers’ camera.
        Utilizing rare archival footage, Summers’ photos, and insights from the
        guitarist’s side of the stage, Can’t Stand Losing You brings together
        past and present as the band members prepare to reunite for the first
        time in two decades later for a global reunion tour in
        2007.</image:caption
