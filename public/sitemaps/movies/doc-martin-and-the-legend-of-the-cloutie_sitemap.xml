        >Doctor Bamford has had enough of village life and is desperate for some
        distance from inquisitive Cornish neighbours. When the local estate
        agent shows him Tregunnt Farm # derelict and miles from anywhere # it's
        love at first sight. But the Bowden family from London also have their
        eye on the property with a view to developing the surrounding land into
        ugly holiday cottages. After being gazumped, the Doc decides to try and
        spook the family into leaving by pretending to be the Beast of
        Bodmin.</image:caption
