        >Community Service the Movie is about a young boy, Billy, who had a
        rough childhood and ends up being committed to a psychiatric center.
        Roughly 20 years later, Billy discovers that one of his old childhood
        tormentors is now in charge of running community service program, which
        is taking place at a campground a few miles away from the psychiatric
        center. When Billy escapes from the institution, eight troubled teens
        are in for more than just a weekend of Community Service.</image:caption
