        >Award-winning filmmaker Sandhya Suri (I for India) skilfully weaves
        together archive footage to create an emotionally resonant story about
        life across India from 1899 to 1947. Drawn exclusively from the BFI
        National Archive, Around India features some of the earliest surviving
        film from India as well as gorgeous travelogues, intimate home movies
        and newsreels from British, French and Indian filmmakers. Taking in
        Maharajas and Viceroys, fakirs and farmhands and personalities such as
        Sabu and Gandhi, the film explores not only the people and places of
        over 70 years ago, but asks us to engage with broader themes of a shared
        history, shifting perspectives in the lead up to Indian independence and
        the ghosts of the past. Around India boasts a superb new score that
        fuses western and Indian music from composer and sarod player Soumik
        Datta.</image:caption
