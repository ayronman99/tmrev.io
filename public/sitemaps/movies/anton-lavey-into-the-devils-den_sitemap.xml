        >In 1989, I met Anton LaVey for the first time. At this time in his
        life, LaVey was seeing only a select few people. For this film, I've met
        and interviewed some of them, to try and create a composite image of
        what he was really like, and what he meant to these people. It's a
        memory lane trip, filled with personal stories, dark humor, great music
        and never before seen material with the Black Pope
        himself.</image:caption
