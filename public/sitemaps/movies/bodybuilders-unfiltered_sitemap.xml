        >Stu and Sophie are pumping iron and eating six huge meals every day.
        They are on a mission to win the World Bodybuilding Finals in Las Vegas.
        We see how their extreme training regime affects their physical and
        mental health and their relationship. Thirty-three-year-old Stu Mac is
        the only professional in Scotland in the international WBFF Bodybuilders
        Federation. Sophie, at just 23, is the only Scottish professional female
        in her class. With combined Instagram followers of 150,000 they are also
        developing a loyal following and are on the cusp of becoming social
        media influencers.</image:caption
