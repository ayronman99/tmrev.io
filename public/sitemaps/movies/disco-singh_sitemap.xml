        >Disco Singh is the story of a struggling singer who was named Lattu
        prasad in a moment of inspiration by his parents. However, there is
        nothing inspirational about his life, which basically involves him
        performing in marriages and parties for his living. Lattu is a failed
        singer who runs an orchestra named Disco Singh. He dreams of only two
        things - success and Sweety. Sweety is a beautiful and successful model.
        Lattu keeps on praying to god to send an angel who can make his dreams
        come true. And sure enough, God does send someone. Bhupinder Singh aka
        Paaji is a dreaded don who is not really an angel but Yamraj. He asks
        Lattu to do a job for him in return of which Lattu will get all the
        money that he wants. And so begins Lattuâ€™s hilarious journey where he
        tries to woo Sweety while trying to save his life from Paaji. Things
        keep on getting more and more complicated for Lattu and how he manages
        to escape from all these pangas is what forms the rest of the
        story.</image:caption
