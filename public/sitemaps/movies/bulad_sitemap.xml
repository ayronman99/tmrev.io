        >Headstrong girl Kenza lives with her father Ouira and grandfather Weljo
        on a car wrecking yard in the countryside of Curaçao. The two men are
        opposites that don't particularly attract: Ouira is a determined and
        rational police officer, while Weljo identifies with the original
        inhabitants and spirituality of the island. As Weljo wishes to prepare
        his passing to the world of spirits, the relationship between Ouira en
        Weljo starts to escalate and the eleven-year-old Kenza searches for her
        own path in-between the two extremes. The down-to-earth and avoidant
        mentality of Ouira no longer offers her all that she needs and slowly
        she opens up to the more mystical and comforting traditions of her
        grandfather.</image:caption
