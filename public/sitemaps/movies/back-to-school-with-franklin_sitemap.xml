        >Franklin and his pals are excited about returning to school after a fun
        summer vacation. They have no idea of just how different and exciting it
        will be until they meet their substitute teacher, Miss Koala, a true
        wonder from down under! Miss Koala sure has a different way of doing
        things. At first the class is a little resistant, but she quickly wins
        them over with her "try-anything-once" attitude. Everyone soon finds
        themselves learning new things and forming their very first soccer team.
        Now, it's up to Franklin and his friends to win one for their favorite
        coach before she's off on a new classroom adventure.</image:caption
