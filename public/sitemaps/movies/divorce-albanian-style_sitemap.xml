        >When in 1961 Albania broke off its relations with the Soviet Union,
        Albanian men married to foreign women were forced to split up with their
        wives and drive them away. The official reason: fear of espionage. Thus
        a coercive mass expulsion of women and children started in Albania.
        Those, who did not obey, spent years in prisons. Families were torn
        apart for more than 30 years. Today these families are trying to
        reunite. Will they succeed? The film tells the stories of three of these
        couples, and of those apparatchiks and officers of the secret services
        who brought about their destruction.</image:caption
