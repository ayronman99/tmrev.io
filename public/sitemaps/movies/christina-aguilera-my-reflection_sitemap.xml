        >Aguilera's first concert video, a repackaging of a slick special that
        aired on ABC-TV in 2000, shows what this "girl" really wants is to move
        beyond the bouncy R&B-flavored pop she's known for. Her cheeky hits
        ("Genie in a Bottle," "Come On Over, Baby," "What a Girl Wants") are
        followed by songs from Mi Reflejo, her Spanish-language album, and My
        Kind of Christmas, her holiday release. She has sweet duets with R&B
        legend Dr. John on "Merry Christmas, Baby" and balladeer Brian McKnight
        on "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas," and shares the stage with
        rapper Lil' Bow Wow (weird, but it works) on "So Emotional" and
        "Christmas Time."</image:caption
