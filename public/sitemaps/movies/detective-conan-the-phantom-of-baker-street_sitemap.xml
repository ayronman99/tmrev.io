        >Noah's Ark—the latest in VR technology and a milestone of human
        innovation—is set for a showcase to Japan's privileged children. They
        have the honour of beginning a new revolution in gaming; however, their
        carefree fun is cut short when a company employee is found murdered,
        with his dying message pointing to a clue hidden within the Ark. Along
        with the Detective Boys and Ran Mouri, Conan Edogawa enters Noah's Ark
        to solve this mystery and ensure the perpetrator is caught. But once
        they're inside the Ark, it takes on a mind of its own, imprisoning them
        and the children within its worlds. To escape and bring the murderer to
        justice, Conan and company must navigate a simulated 19th century London
        and track down the infamous Jack the Ripper—with the lives of 50
        innocent children depending on them.</image:caption
