        >Based on a true story, Cuchera is about Filipino drug mules, drug
        couriers and their recruiters. It follows the story of Isabel, a veteran
        drug mule, in her first attempt at running her own drug transshipment
        operation between Manila and China. Isabelâ€™s character is based on the
        story of an actual Filipina drug mule who was caught with eight capsules
        of heroin lodged in her sex organ, 48 in the rectum and 11 in her
        abdomen after an x-ray was conducted by Chinese authorities. Cuchera
        presents an accurate depiction of how some Filipinos end up becoming
        entrenched in the world of illegal drugs. Currently, the Philippines
        leads all Southeast Asian countries in the number of nationals arrested
        for drug smuggling charges in China. As of 2009, there are currently 95
        Filipinos languishing in various jails in Chinese territories---four of
        whom are on death row. Violators include minors who enter China with
        fake passports.</image:caption
