        >Musician, composer, producer, music theorist, singer and visual artist;
        probably best known for his early work with Roxy Music, his production
        duties for U2 & Coldplay, and as one of the principal innovators of
        ambient music. This documentary film – the first ever about Eno –
        explores his life, career and music between the years 1971 & 1977, the
        period that some view as his golden age. Featuring numerous exclusive
        interviews, contributions from a range of musicians, writers,
        collaborators and friends – plus performance and studio film and an
        abundance of the most exceptional music ever created.</image:caption
