        >A communal house left in trust many years ago to provide art students
        support in the way of free housing, ART HOUSE has accumulated its share
        of legends, lore, art, art junk and a reputation for hard partying. When
        a university dean and an influential descendant of the original
        benefactor decide to turn the place into housing for varsity golf, the
        residents only chance of blocking the move is to prove their value and
        vitality as an artistic community. The burden is on art student Nora Ohr
        (Greta Gerwig), who is energetic, compassionate, but by no means
        perfect. Can the residents of ART HOUSE get their act together and make
        a name for themselves as artists before they're kicked
        out?</image:caption
