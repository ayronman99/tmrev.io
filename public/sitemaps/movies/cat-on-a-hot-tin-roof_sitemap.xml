        >An alcoholic ex-football player drinks his days away, having failed to
        come to terms with his sexuality and his real feelings for his football
        buddy who died after an ambiguous accident. His wife is crucified by her
        desperation to make him desire her: but he resists the affections of his
        wife. His reunion with his father—who is dying of cancer—jogs a host of
        memories and revelations for both father and son.</image:caption
