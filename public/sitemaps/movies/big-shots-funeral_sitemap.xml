        >Yankie director Don Tyler faces mounting insecurity and declining
        health while on location in Beijing, so his assistant hires down-and-out
        camerman YoYo to take the reins. Scrambling, studio boss sells the
        sagging picture to a Japanese media company. But YoYo is determined to
        upstage the whole production by granting the director's wish to have a
        grand "comedy funeral". To raise the money for it, he auctions off
        advertising and sponsorships for the funeral to companies around the
        world. But wait...is Don getting better?</image:caption
