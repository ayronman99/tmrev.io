        >When aspiring children's entertainer Jason gets his long-time crush
        Danny pregnant on their first date, the two choose to make a life
        together as husband and wife. As the prospect of fatherhood looms, Jason
        begins to realize the toll it may take on his career and turns his
        attention toward one last pursuit of his dreams before the baby arrives.
        Feeling ignored, Danny begins to question whether their fledgling
        marriage can survive. The two soon find themselves attracted to other
        people. Jason meets an intern at a local cable station who wants to
        develop a children's show utilizing his talents, and Danny meets a
        pregnancy photographer who goes out of his way to encourage her
        confidence. As these new friendships begin to hint at the possibility of
        romance, Jason and Danny must decide whether they will risk the future
        of their family for the indulgence of a moment's
        pleasure.</image:caption
