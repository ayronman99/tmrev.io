        >An event, which main attraction is the dance marathon, has gathered
        crowds at the market square of the provincial Polish town. Impressive
        prizes compete with another attraction: the concert of the star singer
        Jessica. A local outsider Christian falls for the singer. Soon he
        discovers that her life is far from being a dream and decides to win her
        heart. In the crowd of marathon contestants we will meet many
        individuals who dream of winning the main prize for various motivations.
        Who will turn out to be the winner? Will there be a prize at all?
        Because two small-time crooks, Simon and Silvio, are lurking around. And
        why this persistent notion that our life is so often influenced by
        miracles...?</image:caption
