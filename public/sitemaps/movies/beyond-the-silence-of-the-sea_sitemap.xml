        >The documentary covers the entire maritime sector, its significance and
        contribution in the development in a country. Evergreen Media traveled
        from Karachi to Gadani, to Ormara to Gawadar ports, life of Creeks area,
        Fisheries, Shipyards, boarded the national flag carriers and landed at
        naval combat ships. The voyage unfolds the simple and straightforward
        steps to the prosperity of several nations. The marine sector plays a
        vital role in the economy of a country though it is seldom visible in
        everyday life and thus continues to be undervalued. Maritime activities
        are essential to trade and prosperity. They underpin our quality of life
        by facilitating the safe, reliable and low cost movement of foodstuffs,
        consumer goods and raw materials.</image:caption
