        >The title means "The last postillion (stage-coachman) of the
        St.Gotthard-pass". A company of select people joins the horse-driven
        coach for crossing the center of the Alps over the traditional path high
        on the mountain valley. It is the time of railways as the means of
        modernization. A tunnel is going to be built. The new fast way would
        render useless the small transport industry from which local people had
        made their living. The great mountainous landscape is the background for
        the conflicts which arise between rich and poor, local traditionalists
        and foreign modernizers. The daughter of a local, who is opposed against
        the tunnel, would like to get engaged with a tunnel engineer, but is
        also coveted by a local favored by her father.</image:caption
