        >At winter's end, when the temperature finally climbs above freezing,
        the sleepy bruin emerges from his den. He's lost substantial body weight
        over the cold months and hunger is now his primary motivator. In fact,
        except for a short period during mating season, food will be the black
        bear's primary focus until it returns to its den in the fall. Black
        bears have been known to prey on moose and dear calves but their main
        diet consists of much smaller fare. With up to 800 pounds of bulk to
        support, black bears need to feed constantly to survive and to do so
        they have evolved one of the most omnivorous diets on the planet. You
        name it, they eat it!This film follows the early cycle of the black
        bear's life; its hunting strategies, territorial behaviours, mating
        habits and feeding opportunities.The program will also explore the
        bear's troubled relationship with humans. Although black bears have been
        known to prey on humans, this is extremely rare.</image:caption
