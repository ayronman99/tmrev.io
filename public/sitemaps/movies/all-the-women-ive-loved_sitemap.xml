        >LeBaron Brown would have to be completely nuts to let a vibrant,
        intelligent, sexy woman like Phoenix Morgan walk out of his life. But
        after failing to pop The Question that Phoenix was anticipating on their
        third dating anniversary, he's been dumped faster than he can say
        "commitment phobia." Now, the handsome Washington, D.C., television
        executive is flat on his back in the office of Dr. Leighton Carter,
        psychotherapist, in the hopes of understanding his fear of marriage.
        When Dr. Carter asks him to recall all the women he's loved, LeBaron
        recounts his wild, erotic, risky, funny adventures in and out of bed
        with a bevy of ladyloves. But something is missing. Can LeBaron, who
        thought he knew everything about women, piece together the puzzle of
        himself and still salvage his relationship? Or will Phoenix, on business
        in Paris, discover that when it comes to lovers, the world doesn't
        revolve around LeBaron Brown?</image:caption
