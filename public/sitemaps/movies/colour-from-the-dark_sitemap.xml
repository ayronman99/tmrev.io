        >Pietro and Lucia live on an isolated farm with Alice, Lucia's younger
        sister. Poor farmers, they live tilling the soil. Pietro is a good
        worker and a strong man who, unlike his three brothers, is not at war
        because of a deformed knee. Lucia is a beautiful and reserved woman
        dedicated to her family. Their life is peaceful and good, in spite of
        the hard work. One day, while drawing water from the well, Pietro and
        Alice accidentally free something from Earth's womb. A strange and alien
        color flashes underwater, at the well's bottom, then disappears. From
        that moment on, inexplicable events start happening all around the farm,
        and by night the surrounding vegetation glitters with a sinister glow.
        The color soon takes hold of the whole farm, and dwelling inside Pietro
        and his family's minds, it brings them into its sick world of pain,
        blood and death.</image:caption
