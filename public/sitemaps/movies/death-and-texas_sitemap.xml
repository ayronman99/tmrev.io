        >Barefoot Bobby Briggs, the legendary running back for the Austin Steers
        was today sentenced to die for his role in the armed robbery/murder at a
        downtown Stop 'n Go convenience store... It's five years later, and
        Bobby's appeals have all but run out, and the Austin Steers are - once
        again - on the march to the Superbowl, with a lock on the playoffs, when
        their wide receiver has a season ending injury. With their playoff hopes
        in shambles, the Governor of Texas controversially offers Bobby a
        furlough -- from death row -- to help rescue the Steers' post-season
        hopes, and even play in the Superbowl.</image:caption
