        >Maged, Hisham and Medhat are three friends. Medhat succeeds in finding
        work at a (tourist resort) in Sinai while Maged fails to (get together)
        with his neighbor and sweetheart Sabreen. He resorts to his friend
        Medhat and asks him to help him find work at the (tourist resort) where
        he is employed. Maged saves the life of an elderly American tourist and
        this event helps him find work alongside Medhat. However, (an incident
        occurs) where he flirts with Nesreen, the daughter of the (tourist
        resortâ€™s) owner. He is subsequently fired from his new job. Upon her
        return to her country, the elderly American tourist dies and it is
        revealed that (her faith was Jewish). (Her will stipulates that Maged
        should receive a third of (?) which is valued at 155 million dollars.)
        However a condition is placed specifying that Maged must agree to
        (supervise an attempt to intercede on behalf of Israeli
        interests.)</image:caption
