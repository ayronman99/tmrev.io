        >The sound of flapping bat wings, an empty coffin, glistening fangs,
        tiny punctures on the neck, the sensual taste of blood, a blank
        reflection, fear of the cross, and death from daylight. These are the
        creatures of the night, and as legendary (but fictional) vampire hunter
        Abraham Van Helsing exclaimed: "Gentlemen, we are dealing with the
        undead!" Perhaps the most enduring film genre of all time, vampire films
        continue to haunt us on the big screen. Why are we fascinated with the
        myth of these immortal souls? Could it be the living forever part, or
        perhaps the fact that they have an unearthly sexual attraction to both
        males and females? Whatever it is, audiences around the world can't seem
        to get enough of them.</image:caption
