        >Walking the Earth as an undead spirit has Charlie Jackson in a
        quandary. Unable to interact with his family, Charlie feels he's been
        forsaken by God. Now, his ultimate goal is to get to heaven as soon as
        possible - but that's easier said than done. The battle between good and
        evil for Charlie's soul has begun, and salvation might only come via
        Carol Miller, a darkhunter who brings lost souls back to
        death.</image:caption
