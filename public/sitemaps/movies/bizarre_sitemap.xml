        >Maurice, a reticent young homeless man, somehow manages to get by in
        Brooklyn; he spends his nights in parked cars until he finds himself at
        Bizarre, an underground club renowned for its burlesque shows. Maurice
        is fascinated by the club’s playful revues celebrating self-determined
        sexuality and creative otherness, and the two female club owners both
        adore him. He soon becomes a part of their self-selected family, and
        begins to bond with introverted Luka. But Maurice turns his back on
        Luka’s growing affection. Running away from his true emotions he drifts
        aimlessly through the city. He tries to find his feet at a boxing club,
        where he meets Charlie. Unable to withstand the pressure of his
        repressed feelings, Maurice unleashes a mounting foment of emotions,
        pervaded by tenderness and menace.</image:caption
