        >An astonishing fictional account of the unending series of murders of
        young women in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, which began in 1996. Most of the
        victims are low-paid laborers who have been drawn to the town by the
        possibility of work at American-owned factories. In the film Mexican
        police officer Blanca Bravo is sent to Cuidad Juarez to investigate and
        comes to learn realities of these women's lives, as well as the truth
        about a police force and local power structure embodied by entrepreneur
        Mickey Santos that has ceased to care.</image:caption
