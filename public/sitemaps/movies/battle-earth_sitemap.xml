        >Confirmation of extraterrestrial life appears on television screens
        across the world as a massive spacecraft breaks through the atmosphere
        on a crash course into the Atlantic Ocean. A young paramedic, Greg
        Baker, signs up to fight for his planet against the invaders. Baker
        joins Special Forces members as the squad medic as they escort a
        classified package by chopper over enemy territory. When their chopper
        is shot down they find themselves surrounded and outnumbered. Desperate
        to return to his wife's side and haunted by nightmares, Baker find that
        his role in the war has quickly become much larger than he could have
        ever imagined. The mysterious package may be the key to turning the tide
        of the war, and possibly to saving all of humanity, but Baker must
        decide whether to protect it or sacrifice it to ensure his own
        survival.</image:caption
