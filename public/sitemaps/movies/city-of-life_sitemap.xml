        >A privileged young male Arab at odds with his cultural identity and his
        less fortunate street smart friend; a disillusioned Indian taxi driver
        who bears an uncanny resemblance to a famous Bollywood star; and a
        former Romanian ballet dancer now working as a flight attendant and
        searching for love and companionship ... these individuals all live in
        Dubai and their lives are about to collide for better or for worse in a
        city where ambition, growth and opportunity are encouraged and dreams
        can still manifest. "City of Life" is an urban drama that tracks the
        various intersections of a multi-ethnic cast, examining how random
        interactions and their consequences can irrevocably impact another's
        life.</image:caption
