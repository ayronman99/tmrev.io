        >Serge Morgan is a killer working for the American Mafia. After
        performing a contract in New York for his employers, he takes the plane
        back to Paris and, during the flight, he gets to know Jane, the rich
        daughter of an ambassador. Once in Orly Airport he gets seriously
        wounded by the men of French drug kingpin Henri Emery. He manages to
        escape them though and takes refuge at Jane's. Passion sets in between
        the killer and the young lady. As of then, sex will be intertwined with
        blood and death. For better or worse...</image:caption
