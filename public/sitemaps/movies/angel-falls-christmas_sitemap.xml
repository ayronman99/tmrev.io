        >Ally Morgan is a workaholic ER doctor struggling for work-life balance
        with boyfriend, Josh. On the night they breakup. Ally is miserable alone
        before a chance encounter with handsome barista, Gabe leads her to
        fulfill a Christmas bucket list of fun activities she never would have
        done on her own. Ally's best friend and fellow ER doctor, Dawn has never
        seen Ally so engaged outside of work and is rooting for a Gabe-Ally
        relationship. Now, the saintly Maureen must redirect Gabe's heartfelt
        intentions if Josh and Ally have any chance at reconciliation this
        Christmas.</image:caption
