        >In 1999, filmmakers Joe Brewster and Michèle Stephenson turned the
        camera on themselves and began filming their five-year-old son, Idris,
        and his best friend, Seun, as they started kindergarten at the
        prestigious Dalton School just as the private institution was committing
        to diversify its student body. Their cameras continued to follow both
        families for another 12 years as the paths of the two boys diverged—one
        continued private school while the other pursued a very different route
        through the public education system.</image:caption
