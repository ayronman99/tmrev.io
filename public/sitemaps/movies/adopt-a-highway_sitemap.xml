        >Russ Millings has just been released from prison after serving 21 years
        for a 3rd strike conviction for possessing an ounce of marijuana. As he
        tries to adapt to a world he doesn’t recognize – including trying to
        learn how to use the internet – he finds an abandoned baby in a dumpster
        behind the fast food restaurant where he works as a dishwasher. Unsure
        of what to do, and caught between impulses of kindness and panic, Russ
        soon realizes this could be his chance at redemption. Starring Ethan
        Hawke in a critically acclaimed performance, Adopt a Highway “will
        simultaneously warm and shatter your heart” (Marisa Mirabal,
        Birth.Movies.Death.)</image:caption
