        >Documentary - Set against the rich hues of India, Beyond The Surface
        follows Ishita Malaviya, India's first female surfer, and fellow wave
        riders Crystal Thornburg-Homcy, Liz Clark, Lauren Hill, Emi Koch, and
        Kate Baldwin. While on their journey through southern India, the women
        surfers and the people they meet share experiences and stories related
        to surfing, yoga, and ecological awareness, resulting in mutual feelings
        of hope, a fuel for change, and the empowerment of women. Highlighted by
        the undeniable power of surfing, Malaviya and her group of talented
        women search for the perfect waves as they forge with the people of
        India an unshakable determination to make the world a better place.
