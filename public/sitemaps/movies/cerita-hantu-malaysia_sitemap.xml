        >The film consists of three stories that are interconnected with each
        other. It starts off at an old school where the guard on duty keeps
        experiencing spooky happenings during his shift. This prompts the school
        authorities to call a medium to perform an exorcism to drive the spirits
        away from the school. In the following story, the medium and his
        assistant, Saad, is returning from the school when their car crashes.
        The medium dies from a heart attack. Saad dies when a car hits him. In
        the final story, Jo, Mansur and Akim are looking for their friend, Rose,
        who has been possessed and has gone missing. They encounter many strange
        happenings until they find Saad's and the medium's lifeless bodies by
        the roadside.</image:caption
