        >A teenager visits his mother in search of affection. She lives semi
        isolated from the world, on a house facing the sea and in the company of
        a woman. The meeting of both characters will be rather a disagreement
        that will throw the young man towards other characters that will be
        moving further away from his mother until he disappears. Only at that
        moment will she feel the weight of his absence.</image:caption
