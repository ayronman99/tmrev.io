        >Haiti, a lonely forgotten black island abandoned to its poverty and
        misery. A white woman, Madame lives in a fantasy in which she helps to
        teach, inspire and feed the retched masses of the world. She is in fact
        completely cut off from them â€“ a continent away. The awakening of desire
        between Madame and her black servant boy, Patrick, will lead her from
        her isolation out into the real Haiti, where she will for the first time
        see and hear the land and its people, discover the reality of her own
        body, her identity and come face to face with her own
        mortality.</image:caption
