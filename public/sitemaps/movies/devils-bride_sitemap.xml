        >Anna’s story takes place on Åland Island in 1666, during the beginning
        of the most widespread and systematic witch-hunts in Scandinavian
        history. In all, 16 women were convicted of being in league with the
        devil, and seven of them were executed. For Judge Psilander, who has
        mastered the newest witch theories of the time, the trials are meant to
        cleanse the island of superstition, to have science and common sense
        prevail. The main character, the intelligent and stubborn Anna, gets an
        intimate view of the events, having just started working as a maid in
        the judge’s house. To Anna’s misfortune, she falls intensely in love
        with her friend Rakel’s husband Elias, but his infatuation with her
        quickly fades. A hurt and jealous Anna decides to get revenge and
        falsely reports Rakel to Judge Psilander. It’s only when Rakel is
        arrested, and things get out of hand, that Anna realizes the gravity of
        her doings.</image:caption
