        >Limited Edition DVD included with Drama which is the ninth studio album
        by English musical duo Bananarama, released on 14 November 2005 by A&G
        Records. It features eleven newly recorded tracks, along with a remix of
        their 1986 single "Venus" (done by Soft Cell's Marc Almond) and a 2005
        remix of their 1982 single "Really Saying Something", an underground
        bootleg club hit produced by Solasso. Drama is a comeback of sorts for
        Bananarama members Keren Woodward and Sara Dallin and is their first
        album to be released in their native UK since 1993. The album's first
        single "Move in My Direction" debuted on the UK Singles Chart at number
        14, also becoming their first UK top-40 entry since 1993. The second
        single, "Look on the Floor (Hypnotic Tango)", also reached the UK top
        40, and climbed to number two on the US Hot Dance Club Play chart as an
        import, becoming Bananarama's biggest US dancefloor hit since "Venus"
        two decades earlier.</image:caption
