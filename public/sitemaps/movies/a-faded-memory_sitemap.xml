        >Young-Jae (Ryu Soo-Young) was involved in a car accident two years ago.
        He lost his memory from the accident. Now, Young-Hae runs a used
        bookstore and appears like an ordinary guy, but he has a certificate for
        passing the bar exam in his desk. While Young-Jae was in the hospital
        nobody visited him and he didn't have any numbers saved in his
        cellphone. He has been totally isolated. One day, a parcel is delivered
        to Young-Jae. In the parcel, there is Young-Jae's old wallet containing
        a photo of a smiling woman. The parcel does not have a sender listed.
        Soo-A (Nam Bo-Ra) is an 18-year-old who acts likes she knows everything.
        She expresses to Young-Jae that she likes him. With Soo-A's help,
        Young-Jae tries to find the woman in the picture.</image:caption
