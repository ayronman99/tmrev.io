        >The film is about a high school tech whiz (Laura Marano), who is
        determined to become prom queen. But on the big day, she suddenly wakes
        up having a bad hair day, and her destroyed prom dress, and everything
        that can go wrong, does go badly wrong. A police officer (Leigh-Allyn
        Baker) seeks the necklace that the teen somehow ends up possessing. Prom
        day goes really bad as the pair is pursued by a dogged jewel thief
        (Christian Campbell) on a wild ride cross around the
        city.</image:caption
