        >'Three's Company', the comedy centered on two attractive, young women
        who made the rent on their Santa Monica beach-side apartment by taking
        in a third roommate - a male forced to pretend he's gay to fool the
        landlords and the girls' parents. The series rocketed in the ratings as
        an instant hit - despite the outcry of critics and moralists - who
        objected to the double-entendres and quasi-sexual hijinks on the show.
        However, the true behind-the-scenes story of 'Three's Company' will
        expose a once idyllic workplace that deteriorated into a battleground
        beset by business dealings, contact disputes, cast rivalries, clashes
        between producers and network executives and finally, a round of cast
        replacements which hastened the demise of the show.</image:caption
