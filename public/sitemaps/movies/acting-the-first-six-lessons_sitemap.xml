        >Acting: The First Six Lessons follows The Teacher and his student, The
        Creature, played by Beau Bridges and Emily Bridges. Together they
        explore the craft of acting and evolve in their understanding and
        appreciation of life itself. The story unfolds in six lessons over the
        course of their relationship, nestled within a larger conversation with
        three generations of The Bridges Family. A unique hybrid of narrative
        and documentary storytelling, Acting: The First Six Lessons brings
        Richard Boleslavskyâ€™s 1933 novel to the screen for the first time as
        part of an intimate glimpse into the life and craft of a
        multi-generational acting family.</image:caption
