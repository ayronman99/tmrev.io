        >Tai is now a university student, living alone, working hard at school,
        and working every day, but with his future still undecided. Meanwhile,
        Matt and others continue to work on Digimon incidents and activities
        that help people with their partner Digimon. When an unprecedented
        phenomenon occurs, the DigiDestined discover that when they grow up,
        their relationship with their partner Digimon will come closer to an
        end. As a countdown timer activates on the Digivice, they realize that
        the more they fight with their partner Digimon, the faster their bond
        breaks. Will they fight for others and lose their partner? The time to
        choose and decide is approaching fast. There is a short time before
        “chosen children” will become adults. This is the last adventure of Tai
        and Agumon.</image:caption
