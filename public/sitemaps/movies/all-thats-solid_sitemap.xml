        >ALL THAT'S SOLID (and) MELTS INTO AIR are each separate films shot at
        an exhibition of the urban landscape artist Tyree Suyton in Cambridge at
        Harvard. I was struck by the redemptive critical and visionary character
        of his work which struck me as similar to G.M. Hopkins or Clarence
        Smith. Coincidentally as I was shooting these films I went to a
        screening of Charles Burnett and asked him what film he would like to
        make but couldn't get the money for. He replied, "a feature narrative
        about Tyree Suyton." So I put together four of the films from Spring
        2000 into a four-film work called "4 For Charles Burnett - All That's
        Solid Melts Into Air". They are: ALL THAT'S SOLID, LIGHT LICK,
        TOSCANINI'S EUROPEAN SIDEWALK CAFE, and MELTS INTO AIR.</image:caption
