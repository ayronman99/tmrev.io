        >After languishing in a Barcelona prison for nearly a decade, a busted
        bank robber attempts to find the girl who made off with the cash in this
        suspenseful tale of revenge and betrayal starring Adriana Gil and Eduard
        Fern√°ndez. Ex-con Martin Losada is out of prison and on the hunt. When
        he and his band of anti-Franco bank robbers were busted after a botched
        heist ten years ago, the only member of their team never caught by
        police was his long-gone ex-girlfriend Julia. Now, on the eve of the
        1958 revolution, the recently released ex-con sets his sights on Havana
        in a determined bid to find Julia, and stake his claim on his rightful
        share of the take.</image:caption
