        >Professor Stella Tchaikovski is a concert pianist and teacher. She also
        belongs to the wretched Jews who survived the mass exterminations of the
        Second World War. Today Stella lives in Stockholm but the memories of
        the difficult time she once experienced are still alive, even today she
        avoids some everyday tasks that can make her reminded of Auschwitz,
        whose constant selection and gas chamber she miraculously survived. In
        her apartment she talks about the experiences of the Second World War,
        ideally she does not want to burden her surroundings with her stories
        but she reveals that what she has experienced in Auschwitz rolls like a
        constant ongoing film inside her head – that she has never been able to
        screen herself from.</image:caption
