        >American Meat is a solutions-oriented documentary chronicling the
        current state of the U.S. meat industry. Featuring Joel Salatin, Chuck
        Wirtz, Fred Kirschenmann, Steve Ells, Paul Willis, and farmers across
        America, it takes an even-handed look at animal husbandry. First
        explaining how America arrived at our current industrial system, the
        story shifts to the present day, showing the feedlots and confinement
        houses, not through hidden cameras but through the eyes of the farmers
        who live and work there. From there, the documentary introduces the
        revolution taking root in animal husbandry, led by the charismatic and
        passionate Joel Salatin. Stories are shared of farmers across the
        country who have changed their life to start grass-based farms, and
        everyday solutions highlight actions people can make to support
        America's agriculture.</image:caption
