        >Astronauts Gone Wild: An Investigation Into the Authenticity of the
        Moon Landings is a 2004 documentary film produced and directed by Bart
        Winfield Sibrel, a Nashville, Tennessee-based filmmaker who charges that
        the six Apollo Moon landings in the 1960s and 1970s were elaborate
        hoaxes. Sibrel made this film as a follow-up to his 2001 video A Funny
        Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon, which accuses NASA of falsifying
        the Apollo 11 mission photography. The title of the film is a wordplay
        on the Girls Gone Wild video series.</image:caption
