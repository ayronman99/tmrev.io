        >"A Couple" is a film about a long term relationship between a man and a
        woman. The man is Leo Tolstoy. The woman is his wife, Sophia. They were
        married for 36 years, had 13 children nine of whom survived. Each kept a
        diary. Although they lived together, in the same house, they wrote
        letters frequently to each other. Leo Tolstoy insisted that they read
        their diaries aloud to guests at dinner parties. The Tolstoy’s were also
        a dysfunctional couple, arguing frequently and being very unhappy with
        each other while occasionally enjoying passionate moments of
        reconciliation. The film is Sophia’s monologue about the joys and
        struggles of their life together, loosely drawn from their letters to
        each other and their diary entries.</image:caption
