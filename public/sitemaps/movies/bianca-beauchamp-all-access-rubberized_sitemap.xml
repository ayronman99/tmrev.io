        >Builds up on the original's idea of a fetish-reality-documentary
        melting pot following international latex fetish icon Bianca Beauchamp
        and her kinky friends day and night during a 3-day fetish event, on
        stage, behind the scenes, at home even!, and this time with a lot more
        latex extravagance and glamor! Following Bianca &amp; her friends
        escapades offers a unique perspective on the subject of fetish, often
        considered taboo by many, and sheds a fun light into a world where
        cameras are usually frown upon. The result is a fun and captivating ride
        demystifying international fetish events, its artists, top models and
        party people. The film was shot at the Montreal Fetish Weekend 2007.
