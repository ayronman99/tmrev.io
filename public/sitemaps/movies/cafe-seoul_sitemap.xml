        >Jun, a Japanese freelance reporter, discovers hidden gem of Korean
        traditional bakery "Moran-dang" by chance in the middle of the city of
        Seoul, while covering stories of the city. Moran-dang takes him back to
        his memory of childhood and urges him to stay there for more stories.
        One day, Moran-dang is vandalized by construction villains in town who
        maliciously try to take the spot of the bakery and the owner and chef,
        Sang-Woo gets hands injured. When Moran-dang is in danger of closing,
        little brother Sang-Hyuk returns home after drifting apart. As Jun
        inspires Sang-Hyuk to restore his family tie and the secret recipes,
        Sang-Hyuk and Jun are connected in friendship to save
        Moran-dang.</image:caption
