        >Throughout his career, Haden has constantly sought to transcend the
        boundaries of modern music. Widely considered to be among the greatest
        ever jazz bassists, Haden has contributed pivotal music to a stunning
        scope of genres: avant-garde, small group, big band, world music, folk
        and gospel, to name but a few. From the get-go it was clear for both
        director and subject that the film had to go beyond the generic filmed
        music story: an intimate look at the music and life of one of Jazz’ most
        inspiring and influential musicians. With access to Haden’s own personal
        archive, film sequences shot during concerts and recording sessions,
        interviews with an incredible selection of friends and collaborators and
        great archival footage, the documentary will please diehard jazz fans as
        well as the newly initiated.</image:caption
