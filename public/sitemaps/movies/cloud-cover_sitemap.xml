        >In a city seemingly full of happy people, one young woman walks about
        with a small dark cloud directly over her head. It follows her up the
        stairs and into her apartment. She tries slamming the door on it,
        getting rid of it with a vacuum cleaner, and dumping it in someone
        else's shopping cart. But the cloud doesn't leave her, until she meets a
        young man who has his own sunshine. Is love the way she's going to get
        rid of her cloud? Or will change have to happen from
        within?</image:caption
