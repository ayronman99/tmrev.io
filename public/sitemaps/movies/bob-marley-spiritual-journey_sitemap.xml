        >Bob Marley was the first artist to take reggae music to the masses
        outside his native Jamaica. He also became a symbol of spiritual peace
        and human compassion to people around the globe and is widely regarded
        as one of the true philosophers of both reggae and the Rastafarian
        faith. Bob Marley: Spiritual Journey is a documentary that explores
        Marley as both a musician and a spiritual thinker and, through
        interviews and newsreel footage, attempts to measure his impact on the
        world. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi</image:caption
