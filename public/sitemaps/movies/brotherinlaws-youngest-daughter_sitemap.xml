        >From their college club days, a cohabitation began with Yeon-jeong, a
        female senior who had a crush on him, and Yeong-soo, the president of
        the club. Her circumstances were difficult, and she was taken to Han-soo
        for a while. What confuses Han-soo is Ha-yeon, the daughter of
        Yeon-jeong, who came home late. A face that looks exactly like
        Yeon-jeong in college. But unlike Yeon-jeong those days, she seems
        somehow depressed. Han-soo fell in love with Ha-yeon, who is asleep with
        earphones in the living room, and walks closer and watched her. Ha-yeon
        suddenly opens her eyesand said he can touch it if he wants to.
        Han-soo's mind turned white with Ha-yeon's bold appearance, consistent
        with her blunt appearance.</image:caption
