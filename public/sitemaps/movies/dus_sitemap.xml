        >Siddhant Dheer lives a wealthy lifestyle with his brother, Shashank,
        and sister, Anu. Both Siddhant and Shashank work for India's
        Anti-Terrorist Cell (ATC), along with Aditya and Aditi. After
        interrogating a suspect named Altaf, they get information that
        terrorists are planning a major strike in Canada that may endanger 25000
        lives during the month of May. Altaf tells them the mastermind behind
        this attack is a terrorist named Jambhal, who has a contact named Himmat
        Mehndi. Shashank, and Aditya fly to Canada, meet with ATC Agent Neha,
        and then abduct Himmat, who denies that profusely. The duo team up with
        Canadian Police Officer Danish "Dan", and together attempt to piece
        together whatever information they have gathered from Himmat, only to
        find out that no one is who they claim they are, and the duo find
        themselves entrapped in a web of deceit and lies, with no clues as to
        who is behind the threat - the countdown for which has already begun.
