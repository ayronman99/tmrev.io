        >There’s something very odd going on in space – something that shouldn’t
        be possible. It is as though vast swathes of the universe are being
        hoovered up by a vast and unseen celestial vacuum cleaner. Sasha
        Kaslinsky, the scientist who discovered the phenomenon, is
        understandably nervous: ‘It left us quite unsettled and jittery’ he
        says, ‘because this is not something we planned to find’. The accidental
        discovery of what is ominously being called ‘dark flow’ not only has
        implications for the destinies of large numbers of galaxies – it also
        means that large numbers of scientists might have to find a new way of
        understanding the universe. Dark flow is the latest in a long line of
        phenomena that have threatened to re-write the textbooks. Does it herald
        a new era of understanding, or does it simply mean that everything we
        know about the universe is wrong? .</image:caption
