        >At the beginning of the 2001-02 NBA season, the Los Angeles Lakers were
        the two-time defending champions... at the end, they were an NBA
        DYNASTY! The daunting challenge of winning three titles in a row was put
        to the test in a grueling, seven-game series against the Sacramento
        Kings that found the Lakers on the brink of elimination. Led by
        perennial All-Stars Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, they swept the New
        Jersey Nets in the 2002 NBA Finals and forever put their stamp on
        history. Take an in-depth look into the Lakers' roller coaster season
        that culminated with a third straight championship. This official NBA
        collectible features exclusive interviews, behind-the-scenes locker-room
        access, and heart-pounding game action. From Robert Horry's thrilling
        game-winning three pointers to Phil Jackson's inspiring on-court
        huddles, this DVD captures it all in championship fashion! 60
        minutes.</image:caption
