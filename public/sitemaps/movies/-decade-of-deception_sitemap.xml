        >On the tenth anniversary of the Attacks of September 11th, 2001, expert
        witnesses gathered at Ryerson University in Toronto, Canada to provide
        evidence-based research that called into question the official story of
        9/11. This was known as The Toronto Hearings on 9/11. Over a period of
        four days, these experts in Structural Engineering, Physics, Chemistry,
        and History gave researched and professional testimony to an
        international panel of distinguished judges. The panel of judges, in
        conjunction with the steering committee would go on to publish their
        final analysis of the evidence provided, which called for a new
        investigation into the Attacks of September 11th, 2001. This film is a
        summary of the strongest evidence given over the four days of hearings.
        To see the hearings in their entirety please visit
        http://torontohearings.org/ or read the final report available on the
        aforementioned website.</image:caption
