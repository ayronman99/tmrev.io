        >Brett Gunner left the Secret Service behind him years ago, or so he
        thought. Called back into action when his family is taken hostage at
        gunpoint, Brett must crack an international drug ring that stretches
        from Eastern Europe to the Far East. Landing in Amsterdam, he turns into
        his former self, utilizing his special forces training to track down his
        family and take down drug dealers and pimps along the way. "Loaded with

        Bourne, very entertaining." - Starburst. "Sexy and hip, awesome cars and
