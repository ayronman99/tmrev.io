        >Digital Media: New Learners of the 21st Century takes viewers to the
        frontlines of what is rapidly becoming an education revolution. The
        film, targeted at parents, teachers, and anyone concerned about
        education in America, explores how exceptional educators are
        increasingly using digital media and interactive practices to ignite
        their students' curiosity and ingenuity, help them become civically
        engaged, allow them to collaborate with peers worldwide, and empower
        them to direct their own learning.</image:caption
