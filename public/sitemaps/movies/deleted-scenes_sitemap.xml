        >When 30 something Sean meets Eastern European immigrant Wolf, sparks
        fly. They return to Seanâ€™s apartment and begin a high energy and hugely
        sexual affair. What starts as a mere chance meeting slowly evolves into
        something more. Wolf is easy going, turning tricks to supplement his
        living, while Sean is needy, talkative and neurotic. Creating a stable
        relationship is fraught with problems. With Wolf disappearing for hours
        at a time and Sean doing drugs the two of them seem to be headed down a
        path of destruction.</image:caption
