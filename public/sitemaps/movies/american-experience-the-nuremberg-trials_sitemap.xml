        >One journalist described it as a chance "to see justice catch up with
        evil." On November 20, 1945, the twenty-two surviving representatives of
        the Nazi elite stood before an international military tribunal at the
        Palace of Justice in Nuremberg, Germany; they were charged with the
        systematic murder of millions of people. The ensuing trial pitted U.S.
        chief prosecutor and Supreme Court judge Robert Jackson against Hermann
        GÃ¶ring, the former head of the Nazi air force, whom Adolf Hitler had
        once named to be his successor. Jackson hoped that the trial would make
        a statement that crimes against humanity would never again go
        unpunished. Proving the guilt of the defendants, however, was more
        difficult than Jackson anticipated. This American Experience production
        draws upon rare archival material and eyewitness accounts to recreate
        the dramatic tribunal that defines trial procedure for state criminals
        to this day.</image:caption
