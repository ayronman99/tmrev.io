        >Jody Ann Howells, a survivor of the Still Rivers Massacre now working
        in Bail Enforcement, is on the trail of her latest perp, a young woman
        who is on the run after being found on the scene of a horrific murder, a
        young woman who may be connected to her past. As Howells closes in on
        her she discovers that the killer she faced all those years ago may
        still be alive and kicking and he has his sights on a family making a
        cross country road trip, only this time he's not alone.</image:caption
