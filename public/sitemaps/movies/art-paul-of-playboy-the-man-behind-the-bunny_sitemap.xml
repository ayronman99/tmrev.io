        >ART PAUL OF PLAYBOY: The Man Behind the Bunny, a documentary film on
        the innovation and impact of Art Paul, the creator of the iconic bunny
        logo, founding art director of Playboy, and the magazine's visual guru
        for its first 30 years. Paul is also an extraordinary artist, creating
        thousands of drawings and paintings of his own. The film combines
        interviews with historical footage and artworks--works that were art
        directed by Paul and/or created by him, to bring to life a legendary
        figure of our time. The film is a production of MoraQuest Media, a
        company based in Chicago.</image:caption
