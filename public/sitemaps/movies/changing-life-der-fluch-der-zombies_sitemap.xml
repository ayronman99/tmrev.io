        >A few years ago there was a strange incident in a wooded area near
        Braunschweig. A teacher disappeared with his class during a night hike
        without a trace. To this day the group is missing. It is said that the
        teacher murdered his students and buried them in the forest. Their
        bodies were never found. Residents and relatives of the missing now
        believe that there is a curse on this forest, as they heard voices and
        screams from the undergrowth during evening walks. A group of young drug
        dealers does not bother this old wives' tale very much! They meet in
        this forest to smoke their shit and to let the world sink in. But then
        suddenly things never imagined happen...</image:caption
