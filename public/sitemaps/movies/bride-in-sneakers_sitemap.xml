        >What are the chances that you will meet a bride in a wedding gown with
        sneakers on the subway? Just when Hee-soon was running out of sources to
        write about and found himself in front of a brick wall, a woman arouses
        his curiosity! Web-toon artist Hee-soon followed her. Bo-kyeong calls
        herself the 'unlucky one' and blames herself for everything including
        the time when her groom ran away from the wedding. Why did he run away?
        She didn't know, but she didn't want to resent him for it. So she sets
        out to look for him but the buses have stopped running and she has no
        money for taxi. However, a loser but a nice looking guy asks her where
        she's going. How long will he follow her?</image:caption
