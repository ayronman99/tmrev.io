        >A train speeds through the country on its way to Berlin, then gradually
        slows down as it pulls into the station. It is very early in the
        morning, about 5:00 AM, and the great city is mostly quiet. But before
        long there are some signs of activity, and a few early risers are to be
        seen on the streets. Soon the new day is well underway. It's just a
        typical day in Berlin, but a day full of life and energy.</image:caption
