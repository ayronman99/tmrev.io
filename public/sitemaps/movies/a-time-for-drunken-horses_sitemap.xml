        >After their father dies, a family of five are forced to survive on
        their own in a Kurdish village on the border of Iran and Iraq. Matters
        are made worse when 12 year old Ayoub, the new head of the family, is
        told that his handicapped brother, Madi, needs an immediate operation in
        order to remain alive. This heartbreaking tale shows the lengths to
        which a family will go in order to survive in the harshest of
        conditions, where even the horses are fed liquor in order to
        work.</image:caption
