        >In a small Central African village, boyhood friends Djimi and Koni have
        come of age under a post-colonial government that levies crippling taxes
        and legally robs local farmers of their meager crops. When impulsive
        Koni savagely attacks a visiting government official, the resulting
        massacre forces the two friends on a journey that will transform them
        from boys into men, from farmers into soldiers and from villagers into
        revolutionaries. "We fight in one world so we can live in another,"
        declares Koni as the two battle shoulder to shoulder against government
        troops. But while Koni embraces the politics and carnage of their
        dangerous new guerilla existence, Djimi longs for the simplicity and
        grace of the village life they've left behind. As the rebels move closer
        to victory, the two friends move closer to a clash of their
        own.</image:caption
