        >In 2005, Ben Hibon, with Stateless Films and Blinkink, created an
        animation for MTV Asia's weekly film show called MTV Screen. After a
        very good response, MTV Asia commissioned his company to produce a short
        film on the back of it. “As I was creating concepts drawings,” explains
        Ben Hibon, “MTV Asia was starting to plan their annual Music Awards.
        They then came up with the idea of ‘launching’ our project by using it
        to brand the show; posters, banners, trophy design and intro/bumper
        animations. So the brief changed from ‘short film’ to ‘branding package’
        for the MTV Awards show.” It formed into a seven-minute prologue / intro
        animation to the world of ‘Codehunters’, an on-going MTV/BLINKINK
        project launched around the MTV Asia Awards 2006 in
        Bangkok.</image:caption
