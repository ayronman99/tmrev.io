        >The love of 34-year-old Dora's life, has broken up with her-or worse:
        he has remarried. Her only joy, the pastry shop she owns, also appears
        to be lost. She makes up her mind to get both her ex-boyfriend and her
        pastry shop back, even if it means she has to lie. Along the way, she
        meets other families, as well as her ex-boyfriend's new wife. These
        meetings make her realise the love she is clinging onto has no real
        basis. Dora stops living in a state of romantic self-pity, puts an end
        to the lying and opens up to the possibility of a new real
        relationship.</image:caption
