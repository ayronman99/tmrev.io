        >Following an unexpected breakup weeks before Christmas, Hannah, tech
        wiz and creator of the dating app, Perfect One, heads home for the
        holidays, challenged to save her failing business by re-conceiving a new
        romantic dating model. Upon her return she runs into her high school
        boyfriend, Sam, who she has carefully avoided for years and reluctantly
        makes a deal with her dad to sign up for the townâ€™s Christmas Cupid, an
        anonymous holiday pen pal service. As the season progresses, Hannah is
        smitten by each beautifully written letter she receives and starts to
        believe that her Christmas pen pal could be her soul
        mate.</image:caption
