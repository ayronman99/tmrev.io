        >Released in 2001 , this suite brings together more crews: 13ers, 156,
        BASF, CLM (Controle Le Metro), FMK, GT (Grim Team), MX, SME, Stealing
        Dealing Killing, TMA (The Unknown Crew) and the Swedish WUFC (Writers
        United Fuckin 'Crazy) in Stockholm . The action still taking place in
        Paris , it is considered a classic in the genre of video graffiti thanks
        to some passages having marked the spirits. Notably the first scene or
        the SDK and the WUFC paint an RER, or O'Clock (156) An RER wagon with a
        marker showing great dexterity. In addition to the scenes in the trains
        depots (RER, subway and SNCF trains), there are many passages on the
        street including Jonone (156), Seb (FMK) or the Grim Team, performing
        tags and throw -up. In addition, one discovers the use of the ice peak
        engraving on the metros permanently. A scene is dedicated to the episode
        of 1992 when the subway station of the Louvre was entirely tagged and
        grafted by VEP crew. This event shocked public opinion very
        strongly.</image:caption
