        >With a camera and one simple question, the Chinese filmmaker Liu Wei
        heads for the University of Beijing and Tiananmen Square. "Do you know
        what day it is today?" he asks passers-by, mainly students and young
        people. "June 4th, 2005," most people answer correctly, but many of them
        already guess where the conversation is leading. This is the 16th
        anniversary of the student uprising at Tiananmen Square, which was
        bloodily quashed by the government.</image:caption
