        >Mia, 15, is at odds with everyone. School is hell and her mother is
        always on her back. Mia is only at peace when she is running - something
        she is good at. On a downtown shopping street she meets Zack, 16, who
        runs with a gang of kids who want to become parent independent and live
        as pickpockets. Mia joins them, but finds the pressure difficult.
        Moreover, the police have their eye on them. Mia has a choice, to keep
        ignoring her problems or face up to them.</image:caption
