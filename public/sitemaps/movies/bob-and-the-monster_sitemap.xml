        >Six years in the making, this documentary film follows outspoken
        indie-rock hero Bob Forrest, through his life-threatening struggle with
        addiction, to his transformation into one of the most influential and
        controversial drug counselors in the US today. BOB AND THE MONSTER
        crafts contemporary footage, animation and compelling interviews with
        archival performances and personal videos from Bob's past to reveal the
        complex layers of this troubled, but hopeful soul. Testimony from his
        peers, including Courtney Love, Anthony Kiedis and Flea add texture, but
        it's the depth of Bob's music, interwoven throughout the film, that
        illuminates this unforgettable and inspirational story.</image:caption
