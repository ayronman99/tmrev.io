        >Drew, a young man bullied and abused throughout his life, aspires to be
        a body builder, but can't quite achieve his goals. His sanity ends when
        his girlfriend leaves him for being too much of a health fanatic, and
        he's beaten up and bullied just one too many times. He begins murdering
        local body builders, as he searches for the ultimate key to health and
        strength. Inevitably his search leads him to an ancient secret, which
        adds new truth and meaning to the saying: "you are what you
        eat."</image:caption
