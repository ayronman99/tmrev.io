        >A two-channel installation utilizing both digital video and 16mm film,
        Commensal focuses on the controversial figure of Issei Sagawa, who
        gained notoriety in 1981 when, as a graduate student in Paris, he
        murdered a fellow student and engaged in acts of cannibalism. After his
        release from a mental institution, Sagawa returned to Japan, and later
        appeared in innumerable documentaries and sexploitation films. In
        contrast to earlier journalistic documentaries on Sagawa, the film
        suspends moral judgment and explores a realm that eludes classification
        as either “documentary” or “pure fiction,” to instead chart the
        ambiguous territory between crime, fantasy, and social realities,
        between an individual and the economy of his public
        persona.</image:caption
