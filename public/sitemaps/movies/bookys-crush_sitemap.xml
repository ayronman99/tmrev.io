        >The Thomsons - parents Thomas and Francie, and children Willa, Arthur,
        Beatrice (nicknamed Booky) and Jakey - are a loving working class family
        living in the Depression era in Toronto. Arthur is showing aptitude in
        drawing, and although his parents want to support his skill, Thomas in
        particular wants him to take up a vocation that is a little more stable.
        Willa, the part time librarian, is attracted to Russell, the medical
        student she meets at the library. And 11-year old Booky is happy that
        she has been asked to tutor the new older sixth grade student, Georgie
        Dunlop, in spelling, since she has a crush on him, her first ever. She
        just can't wait for him to ask her to the school dance. But she begins
        to have mixed feelings about Georgie based on a gift he gives to her.
        Digging a little deeper, Booky begins to understand both the good and
        bad of Georgie.</image:caption
