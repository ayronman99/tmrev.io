        >4-Part documentary series where Lee Min Ho films over a 700-day period
        in the DMZ to capture nature and animals. Untouched by humans for over
        half a century, DMZ’s nature would be close to how this land would look
        when the civilization disappears. Nature and wilderness breathe here
        freely, and endangered species have made the place their habitat. With
        the narration of actor Lee Min-ho, the documentary reveals the beauty of
        Korea’s nature in its rawest and purest form. Here, there is a silent
        land where humans stepped down. It is a military demarcation line
        between North and South. It is the foremost front that consumed
        two-thirds of the 37-month Korean War, and the DMZ, a military operation
        area that has not been available for more than 60 years since the
        armistice. It is the largest temperate primeval forest on Earth, where
        human history of heartbreak and the wild survival of wild animals
        coexist.</image:caption
