        >Artist and writer Matt Collings takes the plunge into an alien world of
        equations. He asks top scientists to help him understand five of the
        most famous equations in science, talks to Stephen Hawking about his
        equation for black holes and comes face to face with a particle of
        anti-matter. Along the way he discovers why Newton was right about those
        falling apples and how to make sense of E=mc2. As he gets to grips with
        these equations he wonders whether the concept of artistic beauty has
        any relevance to the world of physics.</image:caption
