        >The critically acclaimed comedian Chris Ramsey brings his latest
        stand-up show exclusively to Amazon this summer. Join the "brilliantly
        engaging natural storyteller" (Evening Standard) as he explores
        everything in his life from his near-miss with Hollywood superstardom to
        his recent near miss with death, what to do when they stop selling your
        favourite underpants, and how to avoid giving up on life in your 30â€™s
        and buying a caravan... all while being sure to watch his tone (at the
        request of his wife).</image:caption
