        >After finding an ad online for “video work,” Sara, a video artist whose
        primary focus is creating intimacy with lonely men, thinks she may have
        found the subject of her dreams. She drives to a remote house in the
        forest and meets a man claiming to be a serial killer. Unable to resist
        the chance to create a truly shocking piece of art, she agrees to spend
        the day with him. However, as the day goes on, she discovers she may
        have dug herself into a hole from which she can’t escape.</image:caption
