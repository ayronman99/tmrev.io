        >Go inside the chaos and courage of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in New
        York in "9/11", updated fifteen years later by the original filmmakers.
        As the only documentary footage from inside the Twin Towers, the film is
        a gripping minute-by-minute account of that harrowing day through the
        lens of French filmmakers and brothers, Gédéon and Jules Naudet, and
        firefighter James Hanlon. The 2016 edition features a new intro from
        Denis Leary, who is closely aligned with advocacy for first responders.
        The updated material focuses on the ongoing health issues that 9/11
        firefighters have battled, and the inspiring stories of “legacy kids” —
        women and men who lost loved ones in the attack and have since become
        firefighters.</image:caption
