        world. His first exhibition in the Capital catches Gloria's eye. She's
        an art student looking for "her" artist. Between the two something's
        born and soon she becomes Adrian's lover and muse, as well as his agent.

        internationally-renowned art critic â€“ and also Gloria's guardian and
        lover before Adrian's arrival.</image:caption
