        >Returning home from a shopping trip to a nearby town, bored suburban
        housewife Laura Jesson is thrown by happenstance into an acquaintance
        with virtuous doctor Alec Harvey. Their casual friendship soon develops
        during their weekly visits into something more emotionally fulfilling
        than either expected, and they must wrestle with the potential havoc
        their deepening relationship would have on their lives and the lives of
        those they love.</image:caption
