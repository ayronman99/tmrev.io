        >After a bank robbery, four criminals escape to Mexico, but a storm
        causes an accident which takes down the plane where several die in the
        crash. The criminals take it into their own hands to continue when one
        survivor is attacked and eaten by a crocodile. The criminals kill it,
        but from then on the mother Crocodile is on a killing spree with a goal
        to kill each survivor. But that is not the only worry, because they're
        trapped within it's world, and if it doesn't kill them, the criminals
        will.</image:caption
