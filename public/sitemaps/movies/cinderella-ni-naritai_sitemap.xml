        >Kuramochi Bon works at a fast food burger joint, taking out the
        garbage. All his life he has been told he is ugly, and has never even
        held hands with a girl. A chance encounter with a mysterious doctor
        leaves him with 3 bottles of a potion which will make him look like
        someone else for 24 hours. When Bon gets transfered to another shop
        temporarily, he decides to use his potion to transform into the most
        handsome employee. With his new-found looks and confidence he reworks
        the shop, and asks the girl of his dreams out on a date.</image:caption
