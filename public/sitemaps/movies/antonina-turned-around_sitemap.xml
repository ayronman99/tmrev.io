        >The main character of this one - Antonina - a wife, mother, mistress of
        the house, wakes up after an unusually bright dream and realizes that
        she has not lived her whole life as she wanted. There were strangers
        around, people she didn't like, and it wasn't her life at all. She
        realizes this so clearly that even at the funeral of her own husband,
        Antonina does not cry, is not killed, and it seems that this death does
        not concern her at all. And this is despite the fact that my husband
        lived a long and prosperous life...</image:caption
