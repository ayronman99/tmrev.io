        >Centre Place is a sophisticated romantic drama featuring Melbourne's
        style, fashion and culture. Set in the very European boutiques, cafes
        and bars of Melbourne's inner lane-ways the film focuses on the highs
        and lows of aspiring artist Lizzie Baxter. Lizzie is a lost soul living
        in denial. At 28, she would prefer to stay in a shallow relationship
        than take charge of her own life. This is Lizzie's unique story but also
        the story of an entire generation; living in limbo and not ready to grow
        up.</image:caption
