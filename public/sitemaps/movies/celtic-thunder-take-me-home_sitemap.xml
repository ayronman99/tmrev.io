        >Celtic Thunder presents Take Me Home, an all new show, as seen on PBS.
        The DVD with a running time of almost 2 hours long features 13 new
        Celtic Thunder performances! After the smash success of the first Celtic
        Thunder production in 2008, producers Sharon Browne and Phil Coulter
        have developed an all-new Irish-music showcase. The sharply dressed male
        vocalists who starred in the first show have returned, and each
        performer gets a chance to show off his pop sensibility. The energetic
        set includes traditional Celtic tunes as well as rock covers and
        original compositions by Coulter.</image:caption
