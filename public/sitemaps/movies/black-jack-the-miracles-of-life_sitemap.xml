        >Black Jack is the "Surgeon with the Hands of God," a mysterious young
        Japanese doctor who travels the world performing feats of miraculous
        surgical genius. Though all recognize his skill, Black Jack is widely
        hated, especially by the medical establishment, because he refuses to
        conform to rules of any kind, and because he charges outrageous fees for
        his services. Black Jack's only companion is Pinoko, a child he created
        out of a special kind of tumor called a teratoma, who insists she is his
        wife.</image:caption
