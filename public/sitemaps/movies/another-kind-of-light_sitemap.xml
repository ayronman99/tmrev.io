        >Sissi and Theo are different, as one can hardly be more different.
        Theo, an intolerant, purposeful businessman who keeps people at bay, and
        Sissi, a young woman who has not yet found her way and still lives with

        Sissi is in rehearsal as a rehab trainer for the blind and Theo her
        first student.</image:caption
