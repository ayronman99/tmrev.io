        >Yvonne is a divorced middle-aged Chinese immigrant who thinks her life
        is over, and she is doomed to spend the rest of her days as a slave to
        her large and eccentric family. Suddenly, romance enters her life and
        Yvonne gets a long deferred chance for true love. However, she falls for
        the last person a Chinese family would ever accept, Jose, a
        Mexican-American dentist. It doesnt matter what race or culture youre
        from, deep down inside we are the same. And from this lesson Yvonne and
        her family begin to love each other for who they are and to accept Jose
        into the family.</image:caption
