        >BEYONCÉ is the fifth studio album by American singer Beyoncé. It was
        released on December 13, 2013 through Parkwood Entertainment and
        Columbia Records. Developed as a "visual album", Beyoncé's songs are
        accompanied by non-linear short films that illustrate the musical
        concepts conceived during production. Its dark and intimate subject
        material includes feminist themes of sex, monogamous love, and
        relationship issues, inspired by Beyoncé's desire to assert her full
        creative freedom.</image:caption
