        >Irina is dying. A predator who stalks streets at night looking for
        blood, she has lived over a century; tormented by memory, living in a
        run-down motel by the sea, Irina has reached the end. Her perceptions
        skewed, her body and mind revolting against themselves, she waits for an
        exit. Her private hell is echoed by the motel manager, driven by an
        obsession to protect Irina and keep her secrets safe, and a broken
        prostitute whose desperate plight may be worse than Irina's. It's the
        tale of three people living a life on the fringe, trapped in world of
        literal and figurative decay.</image:caption
