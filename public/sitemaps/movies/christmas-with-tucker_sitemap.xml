        >While coming to terms with his dad's recent passing in a tractor
        accident, 13-year-old George McCray is living with his grandparents on
        their Kansas farm. George misses his mom, Jill, who has moved to
        Minnesota to deal with her grief, but there is the promise of their
        reunion at Christmas. George feels needed on the farm as he helps his
        grateful grandfather Bo with daily chores and comforts his grandmother
        Cora. He has also made friends with Mary Ann and became attached to
        Tucker, the smart and friendly dog the McCrays take in when his troubled
        owner Frank Thorne lands in jail.</image:caption
