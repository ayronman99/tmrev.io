        >The Korean war does not start well for the US. They are being routed by
        the North Koreans and In July 1950, the early stage of the Korean War,
        at the Jugok Village in the middle of the Korean Peninsula, Chang-yee
        and his friends grow excited over the amateur singing contest knowing
        nothing about what is going on around them. At the time, the US Army
        keeps losing and are pushed back to the village, evacuating all
        villagers to head south. The villagers took refuge like going on a
        picnic believing that the US Army is protecting them, they just follow
        their orders moving south bound.</image:caption
