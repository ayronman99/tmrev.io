        >An Indian folk dancer is caught in his daily struggle of survival in an
        automobile factory. The burden to earn a living for his family and
        preserve his family tradition of ritual Ganesha dancing is humongous.
        His two roles - the sole bread winner of the family and the magnificent
        elephant god Ganesha, are so diverse that his journey from factory to
        village looks like time travel and his existence schizophrenic! Ganesha,
        the dancer lives in the fear of the day when he will have to choose
        between livelihood and art/tradition.</image:caption
