        >Many years ago, the Brooklyn skies were filled with the birds of the
        rooftop pigeon breeders, flying together in complicated and beautiful
        formations. Today the hobby is on the wane, but there is still a small
        group who continues the tradition, some of them flying huge stocks of
        over 1,500 birds. Through interviews with many of the city's longtime
        pigeon fanciers, we are able to explore the lives of these true Brooklyn
        characters, their relationships with each other, and the ever-changing
        neighborhoods in which they live and fly. This project steps into a
        world that exists on Brooklyn's rooftops, where men obsessed with their
        birds have found a connection with nature and the sky above them, one
        that contrasts greatly with the bustling streets only a few flights
        below.</image:caption
