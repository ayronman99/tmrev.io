        >You don’t have to go to the zone to join me in this exceptional
        journey. Thanks to the views from the helmet-cam, you can feel like you
        were really there. You’ll be able to say „I was there” and no one can
        accuse you otherwise. In the film you’ll see places no one has seen
        before (well, almost no one). You’ll also see places no one will see
        again because they don’t exist any more. Everything to make you feel the
        real atmosphere of these places.</image:caption
