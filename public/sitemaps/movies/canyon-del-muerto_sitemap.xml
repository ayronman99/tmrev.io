        >The film, written and produced by Coerte Voorhees, portrays the life of
        Ann Axtell Morris, one of the first female archaeologists. Axtell Morris
        (1900-1945) accompanied her husband Earl on archaeological excavations,
        including in Canyon de Chelly, Aztec Ruins and Mesa Verde, as well as
        the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico. The film is an historical drama
        shooting on location in New Mexico, Arizona, and the Yucatan in Fall
        2020. Axtell Morris was married to Earl Halstead Morris - a primary
        inspiration for Indiana Jones. She is sometimes credited as the
        “co-discoverer” of the Anasazi or Ancestral Puebloan culture, although
        Southwestern Natives might well dispute that terminology.</image:caption
