        >Pak Umar needed a way to get rich quick, so he bought an imp (toyol)
        from a witch doctor. However, he didn't have much money, so he chose the
        cheapest one. One day, Fakhrul and Kudin, two best friends who just so
        happen to be thieves, decide to rob Pak Umar. Having no money, he hands
        them the imp. Unfortunately for the two friends, the imp isn't any good
        at stealing, so they decide to seek out Pak Umar to return the imp.
        However, after some desperate pleading from the creature, they allow the
        imp to have another go. Little do they know that the imp would steal
        from Farah - a girl who is having trouble with a drug trafficker named
        Daniel. Fakhrul and Kudin end up having to help Farah, while at the same
        time trying to trace Pak Umar.</image:caption
