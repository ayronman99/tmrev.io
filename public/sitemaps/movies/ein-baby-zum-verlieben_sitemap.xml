        >Rent-a-baby Traffic policeman Leo Fink has two passions: Firstly the
        revolutionary programme he invented and developed which shall avoid any
        kind of traffic jam and secondly Vera Becker, head of the traffic
        guidance department. She, however, ignores him - at least until she sees
        him carrying a baby. Suddenly, the single woman, otherwise so cool, gets
        interested in Leo who, in turn, scents that this is his big chance. He
        is rather sure that he will be able to win her over to his side with the
        help of the baby and his pioneering plan against traffic jams which he
        wants to introduce to her in a presentation. But there is a small
        problem: Little Felix is not his son.</image:caption
