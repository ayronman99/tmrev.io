        >Covering all aspects of his life from his early years through his
        initial meetings with the other U2 boys and onto early band practise
        sessions and first gigs.The story continues of course, with the global
        rise of U2 and the massive record sales that followed. But it also looks
        at the many other aspects of Bonos life. Using much previously unseen
        footage of both Bono and U2, many exclusive interviews with Bono and
        those whove known him best, and numerous hitherto unseen photographs,
        Gods Favorite Son reveals the complete story of the type of man they
        used to call a hero.</image:caption
