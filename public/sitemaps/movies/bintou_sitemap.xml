        >Bintou wants to make sure that her daughter goes to school, but her
        husband Abel doesn’t think it’s worth it and claims there is only enough
        money to educate their sons. But Bintou won’t give up and starts her own
        business to make the extra money. Abel, wary of losing control and
        scared that Bintou’s newfound financial freedom will lead her to
        adultery, tries to sabotage her efforts. Bintou tackles sexuality,
        gender relations, and the fraught relationship between tradition and
        modernity with joyful satire.</image:caption
