        >All Sides of the Road derives from a twelve-minute 3D video capture of
        Old Highway 101 entering and departing Dewitt, Iowa. After the title
        image, the cameras are pointed directly down at the highway, which
        becomes a rushing microcosm of the world that evokes landscapes both of
        America and of the mind. The resulting spectacle is both utterly
        photorealistic and phantasmagoric. In addition to landscape, this
        digital film also evokes earlier forms of analog film, especially those
        of the American avant-garde, for the physical properties of the highway
        are like those of celluloid. In motion, the textures of asphalt and
        concrete look a lot like film grain, while the lane markers flickering
        by are easily mistaken for the lines and letterings on film leader
        rushing through the projector gate.</image:caption
