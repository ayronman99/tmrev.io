        >The basic content of this film is all about a revolutionary movement
        started by the victims of our stereotypical education system. A
        disheartened IT professor called Tariq Siddhiqi, (Anupam kher) who is
        basically disappointed with the orthodox education system and Devang
        Tripathi (Ashish Vidyarthi) an alcoholic professor who is thrown out
        from Mumbai University for his abstract methodology for teaching and
        Arjun Sheghal, (Ankur Khanna) an under achieving student who disenchants
        the traditional education system as he doesn't believe in grading system
        and Priyanka (Arshi) who wants to break through the typical parental
        pressure of our society to accomplish her passion as a super model.
        Finally as they all possess the same perception towards our
        stereotypical education system, they decide to go against to it and they
        form an abstract pattern of education system to encourage the failed
        students of our society.</image:caption
