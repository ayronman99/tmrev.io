        >Ko Chow is an undercover cop who is under pressure from all sides. His
        boss, Inspector Lau, wants him to infiltrate a gang of ruthless jewel
        thieves; his girlfriend wants him to commit to marriage or she will
        leave Hong Kong with another lover; and he is being pursued by other
        cops who are unaware that he is a colleague. Chow would rather quit the
        force, feeling guilty about betraying gang members who have become his
        friends.</image:caption
