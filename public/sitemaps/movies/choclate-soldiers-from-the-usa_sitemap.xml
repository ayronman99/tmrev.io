        >Chocolate Soldiers from the USA tells the story of 140,000 Black
        American soldiers and thousands of British civilians who crossed a
        racial divide to forge an unexpected bond. While serving in a segregated
        military, Black men and women do much of the U.S. Army's "heavy lifting"
        by day, and introduce the British population to jazz, jitterbugging and
        Black American culture by night. For the first time, Black American
        soldiers experience what it is like to be treated as equals and as
        Americans.t</image:caption
