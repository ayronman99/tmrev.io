        >An old explorer close to freezing in the Arctic re-lives the events
        that brought him there in the first place. He recalls his student days
        at Trinity College in Dublin when he studied under the enigmatic
        Professor Orit, the professor who was driven to madness by his obsessive
        pursuit of the unified theory. Convinced that the answer somehow lay in
        the relationship between the numbers two, three and five, Professor
        Orit's obsession started the journey which has led his former student to
        the top of the world.</image:caption
