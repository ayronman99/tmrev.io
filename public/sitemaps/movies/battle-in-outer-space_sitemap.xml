        >In 1965, the space station JSS-3 is destroyed by a fleet of UFOs, which
        then begin a global siege on Earth, using rays to manipulate gravity and
        control the minds of men. In response, a global council meeting is held
        to determine the source of the attacks and prepare a rocket ship armada
        for a counter-attack, a true battle in outer space. . . The film is a
        sequel of sorts to Toho's THE MYSTERIANS in the reprise of the Etsuko
        Shiraishi character of that film as its heroine. It was edited to 74
        minutes for its American release.</image:caption
