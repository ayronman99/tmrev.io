        >Multi award-winning comedian, Dave Spikey, filmed 'Live' on his sell
        out nation-wide tour. They say that Laughter is the Best Medicine and
        'Doctor' D Spikey is here to administer a massive dose straight onto
        your funny bone. Humour lies in the antics of everyday life and Spikey's
        'Best Medicine' is full of brilliant anecdotes and observations it's
        quite amazing just how funny the world around us really is through the
        eyes of one of Lancashire's finest. Spikey spent over 30 years in the
        NHS and so amongst the stories of school days , cheese addiction,
        monkeys on bikes , llamas on the loose , dancing dobbers and a crash
        course in 'jollyphonics', he delivers hysterical stories about hospital
        life including his recent experiences as a patient with a 'below the
        waist' problem. Our former 'biomedical scientist' bears all and quite
        literally holds nothing back ...... Dave certainly gets close to the
        bone but in over 90 minutes of brilliant ramblings he never oversteps
        the mark HILARIOUS.</image:caption
