        >In 1968, in the Ravenside Military Hospital in a military facility in
        Pennsylvania, the army loses control of an experiment of a lethal
        bacteriologic weapon that changes the DNA and transforms human beings
        into zombies. A group of soldiers is sent to the hospital to eliminate
        the infected staff and interns but private DeLuca steals a test tube
        with the virus and hides it inside a vacuum flask. He is transformed
        into a zombie and killed but the vacuum flask falls in the grass. In the
        present days, a group of patients in the mental institution Ravenside
        Memorial Hospital finds the vacuum flask and later when one of them
        opens the vessel, the culture tube drops on the floor of a bathroom
        contaminating the group and their Dr. Donwynn.</image:caption
