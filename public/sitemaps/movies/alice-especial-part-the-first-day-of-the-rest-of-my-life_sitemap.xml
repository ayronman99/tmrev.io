        >Two years after her arrival in SÃ£o Paulo, Alice continues her
        relationship with Nicholas and has begun to look for a place where they
        can live together. She has also launched a business that produces
        children's shows, and a stable life seems to be taking shape. But as she
        goes about the apartment search and shares in the loves and
        uncertainties of old and new friends, what she observes leaves her far
        less certain of her decisions and her future.</image:caption
