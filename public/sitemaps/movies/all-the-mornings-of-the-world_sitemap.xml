        >It's late 17th century. The viola da gamba player Monsieur de Sainte
        Colombe comes home to find that his wife died while he was away. In his
        grief he builds a small house in his garden into which he moves to
        dedicate his life to music and his two young daughters Madeleine and
        Toinette, avoiding the outside world. Rumor about him and his music is
        widespread, and even reaches to the court of Louis XIV, who wants him at
        his court in Lully's orchestra, but Monsieur de Sainte Colombe refuses.
        One day a young man, Marin Marais, comes to see him with a request, he
        wants to be taught how to play the violin.</image:caption
