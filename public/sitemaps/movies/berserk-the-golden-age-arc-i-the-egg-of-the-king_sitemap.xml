        >Guts, an immensely strong sword-for-hire, has little direction in his
        life, simply fighting one battle after the next. However, this all
        changes suddenly when he meets and is bested by Griffith, a beautiful
        and charismatic young man who leads the Band of the Hawk mercenary army.
        After Guts joins the Band and the relationship between the two men
        begins to blossom, Casca, the tough, lone swordswoman in the Band of the
        Hawk, struggles to accept Guts and the influence he has on the world
        around her. While the two men begin to fight together, Griffith
        continues to rise to power, all seemingly in order to reach his
        mysterious, prophesied goals. What lengths will Guts and Griffith go to
        in order to reach these goals, and where will fate take the two
        men?</image:caption
