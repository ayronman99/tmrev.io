        >'Astram' is the remake of hindi movie 'Sarfarosh' which starred Aamir
        Khan in lead. The movie was a hit at that time. Suresh Krishna has tried
        to match the present cast with that of the original. His selection of
        script is an upset to the audience. He has selected Vishnu in lead but
        failed to have actual grip on the movie. Vishnu has performed well as a
        responsible IPS officer. This can be stated as his best job till now.
        The guy has a long way to go. Anushka, as Vishnu's ladylove, adds
        glamour to the movie. Though Jackie Shroff's role is short, his
        performance is fine. The technical aspects of the movie are pass muster.
        Music by S.A.Rajkumar is a mediocre. Suresh Krishna's direction,
        screenplay are okay.</image:caption
