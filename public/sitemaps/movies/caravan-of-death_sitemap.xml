        >“Where is my son? Why don’t they give him back to me?” In 1973, a month
        after Pinochet seized power in Chile, a helicopter headed north. 4 days
        later it returned. 71 people were dead. What was the real purpose of the
        Caravan of Death? Who gave the order? And where are the dead? 27 years
        later Pinochet is facing trial. Filmed undercover with Judge Juan Guzman
        as he builds the case against Pinochet, this documentary asks whether
        Chilean justice will respect the relatives of the executed and
        disappeared who cannot, and will not, forget them.</image:caption
