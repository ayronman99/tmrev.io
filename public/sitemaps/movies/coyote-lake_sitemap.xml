        >Coyote Lake is a reservoir on the Rio Grande along a dangerous drug
        smuggling route that has become synonymous with cartel violence and
        mysterious disappearances. It is there, on the lake, that Teresa and her
        seventeen-year-old daughter, Ester, run a boarding house where they
        routinely drug, rob and drown the unsuspecting drug-runners and human
        traffickers who stay the night. Teresa justifies the killings to her
        daughter, claiming they are ridding the world of bad people and saving
        the stolen money to leave Coyote Lake and start anew. But when they are
        taken hostage themselves by two intruding cartel gangsters, their dark
        routine is interrupted.</image:caption
