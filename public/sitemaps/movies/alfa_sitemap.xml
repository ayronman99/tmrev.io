        >Alfa, a famous porn actor, must deal with his fears, insecurities and
        memories when he begins work on a new film without Yerry, his former
        partner in life and porn. On his first day of shooting without him, Alfa
        tries to act as in the past but can things be like before? Javier
        Ferreiro's short film reflects on the difficult decision of letting
        someone go to move forward. ALFA is framed in the context of gay porn
        cinema in Cuba where pornography is banned but, little by little, it's
        growing up an underground industry impulsed by foreign
        tourism.</image:caption
