        >A US Navy submarine, the USS Corsair, is operating in the North
        Atlantic, hunting German merchant raiders that are preying on Allied
        shipping. Its new executive officer, Lt. Ward Stewart (Power), has been
        transferred back into submarines after commanding his own PT boat. At
        the submarine base in New London, Connecticut, he asks his new captain,
        Lt. Cmdr. Dewey Connors (Andrews), for a weekend leave to settle his
        affairs before taking up his new assignment. On a train bound for
        Washington D.C., Stewart accidentally encounters New London school
        teacher Jean Hewlett (Baxter) and her students. Despite her initial
        resistance to his efforts, he charms her and they fall in
        love.</image:caption
