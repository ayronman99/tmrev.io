        >Ju Yeon is a young girl who just discovered her homosexuality. She's
        looking for other women like her on the Internet for a movie she wants
        to make and that's how she meets Yeo Gyeong, another lesbian girl who's
        in the same school. The movie also follows Han Na, an office worker who
        lives with her girlfriend Yeong Eun, who will feel betrayed by her
        partner's pregnancy, and Myeong Hee and Hyang Ja, owners of a lesbian
        bar who will face the return of Hyang Ja's estranged
        daughter.</image:caption
