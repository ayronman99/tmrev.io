        >During the civil war years in Lebanon, Akram Zaatari recorded everyday
        life in a diary. Explosions, shelters, and also the purchase of a car
        and driving classes: “contradictions of the life that goes on in
        conflict areas”, says he. The diary was the first contact with image
        production, central in the videos and in the installations that he would
        later do. His work, bearing the marks of the country's changes, feature
        the key subjects of sexuality, politics and history. The film follows
        the artist in his country of origin and in Brazil, and brings as a bonus
        new testimonies from some of the main names in contemporary Lebanese
        art. Zaatari is an active articulator of the Lebanese scene,
        characterised by partnerships and multidisciplinarity.</image:caption
