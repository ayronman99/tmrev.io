        >30-year-old factory worker Simon lives a solitary existence on a
        decrepit farm in the remote French countryside. Devoting his time to
        caring for his sister Estelle, who was left severely disabled when a
        childhood game went horribly wrong, Simon is plagued by guilt and
        depression. But he sees a way out, looking to otherworldly forces as a
        means of liberating both himself and his sister from the corporeal
        prisons in which they are confined.</image:caption
