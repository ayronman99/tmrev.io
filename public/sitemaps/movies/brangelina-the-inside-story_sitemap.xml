        >Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. Brangelina...One of the most iconic and
        sought-after celebrity couples. For more than a decade, the glamorous
        pair fascinated and were idolised by many. For a while, it seemed that
        Brangelina was the perfect love story and that nothing would be able to
        take away the shine of their romance. But...behind closed doors, behind
        the glitz, the glamour, and the fame, the golden couple began to
        crumble. Before it all went wrong, we take a look at the couple that
        will always be remembered as one of the most charismatic, enigmatic and
        compelling duos of present-day Hollywood. Out of a movie set encounter,
        a fictional romance turned into a real-life romance for two of the most
        famous actors of the modern Hollywood scene. After a decade of hysteria,
        the world grieved the loss of one of the world's most influential and
        talented duos. They have come a long way, and they reached an influence
        never before seen in the industry, both together, and
        apart.</image:caption
