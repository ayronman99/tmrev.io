        >Tianyu is a blind child who dreams of a life very different from the
        one planned for him by his mother. Strange as it may seem, she wants to
        turn him into a table tennis champion. When the boy disappears one day,
        his mother sets out in search of him, and she soon understands that she
        needs to hear and feel what her son sees in order to find him. Thus, she
        too must enter a world of darkness.</image:caption
