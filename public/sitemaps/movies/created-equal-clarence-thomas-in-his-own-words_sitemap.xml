        >Justice Thomas tells his entire lifeâ€™s story, looking directly at the
        camera, speaking frankly to the audience. Unscripted and without
        narration, the documentary takes the viewer through a complex and often
        painful life, dealing with race, faith, power, jurisprudence, and
        personal resilience.</image:caption
