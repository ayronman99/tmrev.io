        >The movie centers around Aniq who lives in Penang with his two sisters
        Aisya and Sabrina. He meets and falls in love with Amelia but that was
        where problem arose, because of the traditional standards that both
        families' practices, which require their children to be match-make by
        their parents to the spouse of their (the parents) choices. Not wanting
        to give up, the two love birds eventually cooked up a devious plan where
        they tricked their parents into believing that they are joining a
        "family adoption program", where Aniq will stay in Amelia's family for
        some time and vice versa for Amelia to Aniq's family, in hope of winning
        over the hearts of their potential in-laws. This is, of course, where
        the fun begins...</image:caption
