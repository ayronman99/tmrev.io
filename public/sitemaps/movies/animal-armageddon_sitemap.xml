        >Against a backdrop of global catastrophe, the 6-hour paleontology-based
        documentary miniseries "Animal Armageddon" brings to life an
        unprecedented vision of ancient Earth. From the very beginning, the
        course of evolution has been dramatically altered by catastrophe.
        Numerous mass extinction events have devastated the Animal Kingdom. Each
        time disaster has struck, nature has shown remarkable resiliency.
        Animals have rebounded with with amazing biological innovation and vast
        increases in diversity. Humans have always had a stake in this. From
        tiny flatworms to the first amphibians, our own DNA had to survive for
        us to evolve into what we are now: the first species that can trigger
        its own extinction.</image:caption
