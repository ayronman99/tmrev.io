        >During the economic reform period of the 80’s, three undergraduates
        bind together by a common ambition – to live the American dream. They
        are Cheng Dongqing, a hillbilly who refuses to accept his destiny of
        being a farmer; Meng Xiaojun, a self-confident, cynical intellectual;
        and Wang Yang, an idealistic romantic poet. Xiaojun is the first to
        obtain an US Visa for studying abroad. Yang follows but decides to
        remain in China for his beloved. Poor Dongqing is rejected by the US
        Embassy repeatedly. Baffled, he reluctantly accepts the job as an
        English instructor in the university but eventually gets fired for
        teaching tutorial classes in private. Across the Pacific, Xiaojun fails
        to find a decent job and is driven to work as a busboy in a
        diner.</image:caption
