        >The sport of women's roller derby has made an enormous comeback, now
        with more than 30 leagues nationwide forming the Women's Flat Track
        Derby Association. Blood on the Flat Track focuses on the Rat City
        Rollergirls of Seattle, who formed their league from scratch in April of
        2004. In the first season, the league started playing at a small rink in
        front of about 200 fans; they now sell out of 1,500 tickets monthly.
        This film follows the teams throughout its first two seasons and focuses
        on the women who comprise the league, their teams' struggle to win the
        championship bout and their relationships with each
        other.</image:caption
