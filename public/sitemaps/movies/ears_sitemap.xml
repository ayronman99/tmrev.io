        >A man wakes up one morning with an annoying ringing sound in his ears.
        A note on the fridge says: "Your friend Luigi has died. P.S. I took the
        car". The problem is that he does not even remember who this guy Luigi
        is. This is just the beginning of a tragicomic day during which he will
        be plunged into the folly of the world. One of those days that changes
        your life forever.</image:caption
