        >A rebel's son, Kumander Idel (Manny Pacquiao) pursued his father's work
        as an outlaw who hides in the mountains with a group of men creating
        chaos on the corrupt officials who continue to oppress people. Just like
        a typical anti-hero, he carries a big gun with sexy girls shooting guns
        along with shootouts in the jungle. Using his own unique code of honor,
        he applies justice to all those who deserve punishment. He eventually
        should make a choice between his values and a chance for an easier
        life.</image:caption
