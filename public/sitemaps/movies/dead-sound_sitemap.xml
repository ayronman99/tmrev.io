        >Four best friends from boarding school decide to attend a massive
        blow-out High School graduation party on Block Island. After missing the
        last ferry they decide to hire a fishing boat to take them on what
        should be a simple journey. What they get is the trip from hell, with a
        captain and his first mate that have no intention of taking the kids to
        Block Island, putting them into a fight to survive and to simply make it
        back to land... any land.</image:caption
