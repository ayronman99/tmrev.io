        >Kate Parks has spent the past year on tour promoting her book, an
        in-depth look at the attempted cover up of her husband's death in a
        plane crash. Now all she wants is to return home to her daughter,
        15-year-old Samantha. But when a powerful solar flare strikes her flight
        home, killing the pilot, knocking out the co-pilot and frying all the
        electronic systems on the plane, it looks like she may not get there. As
        panic sets in among the passengers, Kate works with flight attendant
        Jake to manage the growing chaos and tension on the plane as she tries
        to keep 30,000 tons of steel hurtling through the air at 500 miles per
        hour. Flying blind, Kate tries to find a way to communicate with air
        traffic control - one way or another, this plane is coming down. With
        the passengers' lives on the line, Kate will have to find a way to land
        safely... or never see her daughter again.</image:caption
