        >Ben and Bill are the two worst, completely useless agents - real
        losers. But who else would you send on a super-difficult top-secret
        mission? The French have just sold a new high-power M51 rocket to the
        Russians for crazy money. Unfortunately for them, the rocket was
        hijacked before they could get it of their hands. However, not just any
        fool is up to neutralizing this threat, but only the craziest and most
        stupid of them can cope with such a task.</image:caption
