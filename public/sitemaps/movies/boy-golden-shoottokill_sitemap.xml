        >The film is very, very loosely based on the life of Arturo Porcuna
        (Jeorge Estregan). Once upon a time, he was known as Boy Anino,
        notorious leader of the Bahala Na gang. But rival gangster Tony Razon
        (John Estrada) attacked him in his home, leaving his entire gang and his
        family dead in the ruins. But Porcuna survived, and now he returns under
        a new alias, Boy Golden, and he seeks revenge against those that did him
        wrong. Along the way, he meets Marla D (KC Concepcion), a dancer who
        also has a bone to pick with Razon. Together, the two carry out a
        dangerous plan to take on Manilaâ€™s toughest gangsters.</image:caption
