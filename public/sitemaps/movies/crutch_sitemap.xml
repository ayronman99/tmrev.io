        >Two decades of exclusive access, plus a lifetime of archival footage,
        depict Shannon from his early years, to his rise as an award-winning
        dancer and cutting-edge performance artist whose work finds outlet at
        prestigious venues worldwide. CRUTCH examines Shannon’s controversial
        street performances as he exposes the hidden world of assumptions
        disabled people encounter in public, on a daily basis. While the film
        questions his early exploitation of strangers’ good Samaritan impulses,
        it also marvels at Shannon's ability to create solutions and empower
        others to navigate similar challenges. From childhood “cripple” to
        international provocateur, CRUTCH is an emotional story of an artist’s
        struggle to be understood.</image:caption
