        >On a night of April 1957, Albertine, a brillant and rebel 19-year-old
        girl, jumps from the wall of the prison where she’s serving a sentence
        for a holdup. In her fall, a bone from her ankle breaks: the astragal.
        She is rescued by Julien, a justice fugitive, and so is born a burning
        passion between them. He takes her to Paris and hides her. But while he
        leads his gangster life here and there, the young woman struggles for
        her freedom and against the wounds inflicted by Julien’s absence, and
        writes poetry.</image:caption
