        >The city today is as rationalised and regulated as a production
        process. The images which today determine the day of the city are
        operative images, control images. Representations of traffic regulation,
        by car, train or metro, representations determining the height at which
        mobile phone network transmitters are fixed, and where the holes in the
        networks are. Images from thermo-cameras to discover heat loss from
        buildings. And digital models of the city, portrayed with fewer shapes
        of buildings or roofs than were used in the 19th century when planned
        industrial cities arose, amongst them the Lille agglomeration. Despite
        their boulevards, promenades, market places, arcades and churches, these
        cities are already machines for living and working. I too want to
        "remake" the city films, but with different images. Limited time and
        means themselves demand concentration on just a few, archetypal
        chapters. Fragments, or preliminary studies.</image:caption
