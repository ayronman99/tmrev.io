        >Domestic (as long as it lasts) was made in 2002 in Gordon’s one-bedroom
        apartment in downtown New York City. It shows the artist’s foot
        repeatedly kicking the camera around a clean, quiet domestic space until
        the video blacks out. The victim of the booting, the camera itself, is
        recording the footage we see. The viewer is disoriented by the film’s
        upsetting of the conventional relationship between documenting and
        participating, which makes the camera complicit in the
        act.</image:caption
