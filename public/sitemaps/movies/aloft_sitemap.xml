        >As we follow a mother and her son, we delve into a past marred by an
        accident that tears them apart. She will become a renowned artist and
        healer, and he will grow into his own and a peculiar falconer who bears
        the marks of a double absence. In the present, a young journalist will
        bring about an encounter between the two that puts the very meaning of
        life and art into question, so that we may contemplate the possibility
        of living life to its fullest, despite the uncertainties littering our
        paths.</image:caption
