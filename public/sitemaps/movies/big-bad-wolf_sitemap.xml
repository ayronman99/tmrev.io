        >In Cameron, a group of hunters is attacked by a wild animal, and
        Charlie Cowley survives, but sees his brother Scott dying. Seven years
        later, his teenage nephew Derek Cowley steals the key of his
        stepfather's cabin in the isolated Fire Road 13, and travels with four
        classmates and his friend Sam to spend the weekend having a party with
        booze and sex. However, they are attacked by a Beast that kills his
        friends in a sadistic way. Sam and Derek survive, and they suspect that
        his stepfather, Mitchell Toblat, is a werewolf. When Charlie meets Derek
        and Sam, they decide to collect evidence to prove that Mitchell is the
        Beast and kill him, but Mitchell discovers their plot and chases the
        trio.</image:caption
