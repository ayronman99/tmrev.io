        >Sonia and Branca are two close friends at their thirties's sexual peak,
        on the verge of their cosmopolitan loneliness. Despite the long
        relationship that keeps them together, they are so distant, that it's as
        if they didn't really know each other. Cronica Feminina (Women's Tales)
        is a dramatic comedy that talks about women, but essentially approaches,
        from the point of view of its characters, the human need to communicate,
        seduce, fantasize, the need for love in the bottom of all
        things</image:caption
