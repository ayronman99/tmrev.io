        >Hairi (Saiful Apek) is a loser who lives in Metrofulus. While working
        in the lab, he accidentally drinks coffee that has been contaminated by
        a virus-infected gecko. He soon finds himself doing the most insane
        things, such as sticking to walls, making chirping cicak noises and
        adding bugs to his menu. He turns to his best friend and apartment mate,
        Danny (Yusry Abdul Halim), and begs him to find the reason behind his
        strange antics. Meanwhile, the people of Metrofulus are constantly being
        infected by new strains of viruses, and the only cure seems to come only
        from Professor Klon's (Aznil Nawawi) lab. Suspecting something amiss,
        Hairi and Danny launch their own investigation and discover that
        Professor Klon is not only the creator of such viruses, but also has a
        more sinister plan up his sleeve, backed by his business partners, the
        Ginger Boys Ramlie and AC Mizal, who first tend to take revenge on
        Professor Klon's failed experiment on them; making their senses turn
        abnormal.</image:caption
