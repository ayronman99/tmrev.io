        >Could you forgive a person who murdered your family? This is the
        question faced by the subjects of As We Forgive, a documentary about
        Rosaria and Chantal-two Rwandan women coming face-to-face with the men
        who slaughtered their families during the 1994 genocide. The subjects of
        As We Forgive speak for a nation still wracked by the grief of a
        genocide that killed one in eight Rwandans in 1994. Overwhelmed by an
        enormous backlog of court cases, the government has returned over 50,000
        thousand genocide perpetrators back to the very communities they helped
        to destroy. Without the hope of full justice, Rwanda has turned to a new
        solution: Reconciliation. But can it be done? Can survivors truly
        forgive the killers who destroyed their families? Can the government
        expect this from its people? And can the church, which failed at moral
        leadership during the genocide, fit into the process of reconciliation
        today?</image:caption
