        >Szymon Kosowski, a handsome and athletic doctor of one of the private
        clinics in Warsaw, who is the object of sighs among patients and female
        staff, especially nurses Pati, notices a beautiful and witty corporate
        employee and roller lover - Basia, which flows into one of the city's
        fountains. Soon they both fall in love with each other at first sight.
        Unfortunately, a series of unlucky coincidences causes them to lose
        contact. From then on, they do everything to find each other. Meanwhile,
        Basia catches the eye of playboy, the son of wealthy parents, a friend
        from primary school - Leon Glec, who received an ultimatum from his
        parents: he will either get married quickly or be
        disinherited.</image:caption
