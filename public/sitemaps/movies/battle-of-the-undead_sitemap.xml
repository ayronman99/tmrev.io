        >Doron, a security operative, who takes on one last mission: to capture,
        number 3 in the terrorist organization of Hezbollah, in Lebanon. With an
        elite force, Doron enters Lebanon to complete his last mission. Very
        soon he discovers that reality is not so simple, and that a new and
        unknown enemy is to be dealt with - and Hezbollah are the last thing on
        his mind. Doron has to deal with a ticking clock in the form of
        extensive I.D.F attack and a bloodthirsty enemy, Now that their enemy
        has changed its face, it's up to him and his unit to wage a new war, a
        different war, to find an antidote, get back across the border, before
        the middle east conflict is changed forever.</image:caption
