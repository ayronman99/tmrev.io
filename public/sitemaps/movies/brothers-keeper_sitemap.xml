        >Yusuf and his best friend Memo are pupils at a boarding school for
        Kurdish boys, secluded in the mountains of Eastern Anatolia. When Memo
        falls mysteriously ill, Yusuf is forced to struggle through the
        bureaucratic obstacles put up by the school's repressive authorities to
        try to help his friend. But by the time the adults in charge finally
        understand the seriousness of Memo's condition and try to get him to the
        hospital, the school has been buried under a sudden, heavy snowfall.
        With no way out and now desperate to reach help, teachers and pupils
        engage in a blame game where grudges, feelings of guilt and hidden
        secrets emerge, as time ticks mercilessly on and threatens to run
        out.</image:caption
