        >A young immigrant seeking his fortune and new life in America begins to
        unlock secrets of his forgotten past in unexpected ways thanks to a
        spiritual connection with a distant stranger he never knew existed. Adam
        grew up on a small farm in the mountains of communist Poland. Abandoned
        by his parents at a young age he was raised by a kind, ever-loving woman
        named Julia Baron. Confronted with the astounding lack of opportunity
        facing everyone, Adam leaves his home life in search of a better life.
        With some difficulty getting out of the country, including a threat from
        his girl friend to turn him in for treason, he arrives in America to
        find both what he did- and did not- expect. Upon his arrival he finds a
        limo waiting for him, driven by a mysterious person who takes him on a
        cross country tripwithout any apparent destination.</image:caption
