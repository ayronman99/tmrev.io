        >Based on the book “The Legend of Mickey Tussler”, this film follows the
        story of eighteen-year-old Mickey Tussler, who lives on a farm with his
        father and mother and who has Asperger’s Syndrome, a form of autism. But
        he can throw apples at an amazing speed. When a chance meeting occurs
        with the baseball manager of the semi-pro team the River Rats, from
        Clayton, Ohio, Mickey gets a chance to pitch for the team and to prove
        to his father he can do more than live hidden away on the family farm,
        taking care of his pig Oscar.</image:caption
