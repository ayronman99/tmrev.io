        >Captain Fedor Volkonogov works in law enforcement. He is on the good
        books of the management, and his colleagues respect him. But one day,
        his life abruptly changes: he is declared a criminal. The Captain
        manages to run away before he is arrested. Suddenly he turns into an
        outcast, whom his former colleagues search across the whole city. At
        night Volkonogov is visited by a messenger from the other world, who
        warns him that after death he will go hell and be tormented forever. But
        he has an opportunity to change his fate and get to paradise if he
        repents, and at least one person forgives him. The Captain embarks on
        his way to find forgiveness. But he cannot even fathom what tests are
        awaiting him on this way.</image:caption
