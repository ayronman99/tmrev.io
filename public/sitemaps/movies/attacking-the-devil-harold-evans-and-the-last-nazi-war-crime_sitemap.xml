        >As editor of The Sunday Times for fourteen years, Sir Harold Evans
        proved to be the right man in the right place at the right time. In an
        investigative climate all too rare by today's standards, Evans had the
        freedom and resources to allow teams of journalists to work on long-term
        projects, including the exposure of Kim Philby as a Soviet spy. As Evans
        himself details in this stylish documentary, his longest and most hard
        fought campaign was for the victims of Thalidomide. Originally developed
        by the Germans in World War II to counter effect sarin gas, post-war the
        drug was blithely prescribed by British doctors as an antidote to
        morning sickness, leading to tens of thousands of children born with
        serious defects. The Sunday Times' fight to win compensation for their
        struggling families would take more than a decade, as Evans tenaciously
        pursued the drug companies through the English courts and
        beyond.</image:caption
