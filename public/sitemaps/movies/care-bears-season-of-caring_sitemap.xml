        >Celebrate the seasons with the Care Bears, as the fun, friendly little
        creatures love and laugh all year round. Hugs and Tugs are kept inside
        by the rain in "It's Raining, It's Boring," but they manage to overcome
        their boredom with lots of fun activities. Champ helps a young skiier
        gain the confidence to hit the slopes after an accident in "No Business
        like Snow Business," while elsewhere Beastly and Shreeky try to stop
        him. In "The Cloud Monster," Bright Heart is busily creating a cloud
        machine to capture the monster that Beastly made. Other episodes include
        "Caring For Spring," "Ski Trouble," and "The Frozen
        Forest."</image:caption
