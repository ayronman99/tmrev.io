        >Brit, Sophie, Todd, and Andy, a very unlikely group, find themselves
        working together on an economics project their teacher Miss Rose
        assigns. Each student, believes they are in control and wiser than they
        really are. They face harsh consequences that their parents are
        oblivious to. Sophie deals with a slutty reputation and a virgin's frame
        of reference. Todd feels invincible and decides to mug a stranger with
        dyer results. Andy faces a homosexual experience when the disrespect for
        his parents forces them to lock him out after curfew. And Brit finds
        that being a bitch that does drugs is a hard thing to hide when you are
        the most popular girl at school.</image:caption
