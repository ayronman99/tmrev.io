        >The impressive building of the Moscow Hotel, erected in the heart of
        the city back in 1935, has been one of the most familiar architectural
        and historical symbols of our capital for 70 years. For the first hotel
        built under Soviet rule, this symbolic place was chosen - a stone's
        throw from the Kremlin. Its walls were mute witnesses to all the most
        important events of Russian history – military bombing and Victory Day
        parade, Stalin's funeral and the first Moscow Film Festival, fireworks
        and political rallies of the early 90s. And recently, because of the
        emergency condition, they decided to demolish the hotel, and build a new
        one in its place, looking exactly the same ... but only with an
        ultramodern five-star filling.</image:caption
