        >Based on actual events about the harsh realities of teenagers living
        life in a group home (where over 100,000 American juveniles live each
        year). The story: Roy (Josh Keaton), a new kid and artist from the
        suburbs is tested by Daryl (Carl Gilliard), the group home leader and
        his military style rules, a forbidden romance with Laura (Chloe Taylor),
        his streetwise and reactionary roommate (Danny Arroyo), and his own
        troubled past as he tries to survive until 'graduation day'. In the end,
        only his art can save his dreams of love, hope and
        freedom.</image:caption
