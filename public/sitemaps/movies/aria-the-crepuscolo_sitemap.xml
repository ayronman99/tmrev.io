        >The season is fall and the city of Neo-Venezia is covered in fallen
        leaves. Something is bothering Anya, who works at Orange Planet. Her
        senior colleagues Alice and Athena haven't seen each other due to their
        busy schedules, which is making Athena feel sad. But for some reason,
        Alice seems to be avoiding her altogether. With her friends Ai and
        Azusa's help, Anya tries to find a definitive way for Alice and Athena
        to get together. But during this time, Anya learns of a situation that
        only she can see because of where she stands.</image:caption
