        >John Palmentario is desperate not to follow in his father's
        footsteps... NOT to make the same mistakes. At 34, John looks back on
        his life as a paid thug who won't kill or carry a gun and realizes that
        his life is not such a far cry from that of his father's. John buys a
        ring and tells his best friend he's ready to quit and marry his
        girlfriend. Stunned, he convinces John to do just 2 more jobs so that he
        can get settled but John's life is suddenly turned around with the
        appearance of a mysterious stranger. Can John make the choices to change
        his life, or is it BRED IN THE BONE?</image:caption
