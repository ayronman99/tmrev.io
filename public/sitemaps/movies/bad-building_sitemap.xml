        >The Desmond - the building's pleasant sounding name hides a troubled
        past. The high rise has a long history of fires, murders, madness and
        even colonial era genocide upon the site. The towering building has
        stood empty for the better part of a century and even squatters dare not
        enter it's fortress like walls. But now Johnny Craig, the host of the
        popular TV paranormal investigation show 'America's Most Haunted' is
        planning to do a prime-time special from inside The Desmond. With no
        known way in, or out, Craig has contacted a group of urban explorers to
        help him and his film crew enter the building. But when Craig and his
        team set foot inside The Desmond the events that caused the building to
        be abandoned in the first place begin to repeat.</image:caption
