        >This documentary explores the life of jazz singer Anita O'Day. As a
        child, Anita had a tonsillectomy, during which her uvula was
        accidentally removed. The surgery prevents her from singing vibrato and
        holding long notes, but lends to her much-revered percussive style.
        Anita overcomes her vocal hurdle, as well as many others -- including
        poverty, heroin addiction and jail time for a drug arrest -- to become
        one of the most prolific and respected jazz vocalists of the 20th
        century. Initial release: 30 April 2007</image:caption
