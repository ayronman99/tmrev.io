        >When a young cellist called Eve Taylor gets kidnapped and imprisoned in
        a dungeon-like basement, Police Detective Barnbrooke believes it is the
        work of the notorious psychopath the media has named "The Pied Piper".
        But having failed to stop him in over fourteen years and with three
        other girls missing-presumed dead, Police Detective Barnbrooke knows all
        too well that if he canâ€™t pin down his only suspect this time, that Eve
        will find the same fate as the other Pied Piper Victims. Knowing the
        identity of the Pied Piper is one thing, but proving it in time is a
        different deadlier story.</image:caption
