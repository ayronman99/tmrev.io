        >Live at Shepherds Bush Empire is an official DVD/home-video released by
        Björk on November 19, 2001. The live show was recorded at the end of the
        Post tour on February 27, 1997, at a special fan-club only free concert
        at the Shepherds Bush Empire in London, England. The majority of the
        songs are taken from the album Post, as well as some from her first
        album Debut. The track "I Go Humble" is a B-side, and appears on the
        "Isobel" single. Many of the performances from this concert can be found
        on the Post Live album, released as part of the Live Box in 2003 and
        later made available separately. The song that appears over the end
        credits is "Glóra", a flute instrumental recorded when Björk was in The
        Elgar Sisters. Two track that were performed on the night are omitted
        from this DVD - "It's Oh So Quiet" and "Big Time Sensuality" (these were
        performed after the last track included here).</image:caption
