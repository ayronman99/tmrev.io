        >A usual chain mail is forwarded to a group of people. Some pass it
        while others ignore. One dies and is followed by series of sudden and
        unexplainable deaths of others. Soon after, a revelation begins to
        unfold, the chain mail is cursed and so she has to find the origin and
        mystery behind to stop the misfortunes it may cause to anyone who fails
        to pass it before another life perish again. Sandra also suspects Anne
        is behind the tragic incidents that happened to their friends. Will she
        break the curse before it's too late or will she become one of the
        victims?</image:caption
