        >Susan is a newspaper staffer who decides to generate some Christmas
        spirit by writing an article about her family’s storied 100-year-old,
        hand-carved, heirloom Christmas angel. This leads her to accidentally
        meet Brady, a cute, upbeat artist who insists that he and Susan become
        fast friends (at least). It turns out that this angel also has the
        spiritual power to bring people together – as it seems to be doing with
        Susan and Brady. What’s behind this enchanted ornament? As time moves
        on, more about this captivating artifact is revealed.</image:caption
