        >In 2001 Jack Cardiff (1914-2009) became the first director of
        photography in the history of the Academy Awards to win an Honorary
        Oscar. But the first time he clasped the famous statuette in his hand
        was a half-century earlier when his Technicolor camerawork was awarded
        for Powell and Pressburger's Black Narcissus. Beyond John Huston's The
        African Queen and King Vidor's War and Peace, the films of the
        British-Hungarian creative duo (The Red Shoes and A Matter of Life and
        Death too) guaranteed immortality for the renowned cameraman whose
        career spanned seventy years.</image:caption
