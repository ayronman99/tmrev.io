        >This documentary is about an Ethiopian couple who has become the victim
        of age-old traditions of forcing girls to marry at a very young age.
        They become pregnant, too young to give birth, their pelvis not fully
        grown. The result: obstetric fistula, continues loss of urine and often
        banishment from their communities. Often the baby dies and the mother is
        left with fistula. It is the story of Yezina and Mesganow. They live in
        a small village, many miles from the nearest town and civilization.
        Mesganow want his wife to heal so they can have a child together. He
        sells his ox in order to finance the surgery in Fistula Hospital in far
        way Addis Abeba. Yezina is lucky with her husband. Most men abandon
        their wives, since they are being looked upon by their community when
        they don't have children.</image:caption
