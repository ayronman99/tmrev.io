        >The legendary press conference in San Fransisco at KQED studios on Dec.
        3rd 1965. This was a pivotal year in Bob Dylan's career. In the early
        part of the year he released "Bringing It All Back Home", the first
        album that saw him move distinctly away from his folk music origins. In
        the summer he followed it with "Highway 61 Revisited", an out and out
        rock 'n' roll album, and the single "Like A Rolling Stone" hit No.2 on
        the US charts. His appearance at that year's Newport Folk Festival saw
        him use an electric guitar on stage, a hugely controversial move at the
        time that saw him booed by much of the audience. Against this
        background, Dylan went into the studios of TV station KQED in San
        Francisco for a broadcast press conference hosted by Ralph J. Gleason,
        his only one from this era ever to be filmed.</image:caption
