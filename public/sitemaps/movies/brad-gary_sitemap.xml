        >This short film created by director Pyer Coffin is the story of Brad
        and Gary, two creatures living in an unknown world. The plot revolves
        around the big idea that joining forces to overcome one's shortcomings
        really is the only way out. Or in. Or maybe out again? It's also a tale
        about friendship, its ups and downs, ins and outs... This fresh look on
        solidarity was brought to life by the Illumination Mac Guff Studio, the
        team behind the success of Despicable Me.</image:caption
