        >Arturo Bola√±o is a mediocre insurance salesman who loves women, booze
        and any short cut he can find to Easy Street. He thinks he's found it
        with the beautiful Rebeca Solis, the wife of the owner of the hotel
        where he stays on business. Rebeca wants nothing more than to escape
        from her husband and after Arturo falls in love, she asks him to help
        her get rid of him. The plan goes without a hitch but just as they think
        they are going to get away with murder, they receive an anonymous letter
        from a witness to the crime.</image:caption
