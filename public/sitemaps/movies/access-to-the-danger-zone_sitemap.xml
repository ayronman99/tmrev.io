        >Directed by Peter Casaer and narrated by Daniel Day-Lewis, this
        documentary provides a harrowing look at the challenges of delivering
        humanitarian aid in armed conflicts. “Access to the Danger Zone”
        explores the strategies that Doctors Without Borders has employed to
        save lives in the world’s worst war zones, including Afghanistan,
        Somalia, and eastern Democratic Republic of Congo—strategies that are
        tested each and every day. Interviews with key experts from Doctors
        Without Borders, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and the
        United Nations are accompanied by dramatic footage shot in these
        countries in 2011 and 2012.</image:caption
