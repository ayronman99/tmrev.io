        >Matt (Matt Farley) has recently been elected mayor of Thomasville, a
        small New England town. Along with his assistant Charlie (Charlie
        Roxburgh), Matt has caused quite a stir by making radical proposals,
        such as the banishment of motorized vehicles and the construction of an
        underground pedestrian walkway. When he announces plans to develop a
        vast wilderness tract known as Cruben Country, Matt angers some of the
        cityâ€™s most powerful residents. Despite this stressful situation, Matt
        does his best to nurture a budding relationship with Melanie, a local
        newspaper reporter. With the covert Druids scheming against them, Matt
        and Charlie are about to find out that they not only have to fight for
        their political opinions, they also have to fight for their
        lives!</image:caption
