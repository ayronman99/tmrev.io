        >Arhingsaka was born in India to a noble family. Despite his noble
        birth, his horoscope showed to be born under the sign of thieves, and
        thus was preordained for a wicked life. On his 16th birthday his father
        sent him to complete his education and Arhingsaka became the teacher's
        favorite; the other jealous students told the master that Arhingsaka was
        flirting with the teachers wife. Deciding to punish his former star
        pupil, he told Arhingsaka : "You have almost completed your training;
        there is just one thing left to do. Once you finish your life of
        suffering will be over, and you will become a Bodhisattva. You must
        single-handedly kill 1,000 people"</image:caption
