        >When Ahab's mother dies in childbirth, the infant's gruff father places
        his son in the care of his pious aunt. It is Rose who sparks the
        imagination of the young boy by teaching him to read the Bible, though
        when Ahab is reclaimed by his father a decade later the growing boy
        strives to become a hunter like his old man. Later, after Ahab warms to
        his father's lover Louise, the old man dies and the boy is sent back to
        his God-fearing aunt. Rejecting Rose and her abusive husband Henry's
        unforginv brand of discipline and infuriated that his aunt confiscated
        the locket given to him by Louise, young Ahab boldly stages his own
        kidnapping as an ingenious escape plan.</image:caption
