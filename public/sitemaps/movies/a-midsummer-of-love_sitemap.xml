        >The Swedish summer is on and Göran, recently dumped by his girlfriend,
        is searching for the woman of his dreams. Göran is not altogether in
        harmony with himself or his work situation and is trying a little bit
        too hard to please everyone around him. Unlike his best friend however,
        he is not prepared to compromise with love and settle for the less than
        perfect girl. In pursuit of love he sails out to a Midsummer party in
        the seductive Swedish archipelago. Unexpected love lurks in the bright
        Swedish summer's night ready to rock the raft of romance. Comedy and
        romance are the main ingredients when a story unfolds about young urban
        self conscious people in a high society setting.</image:caption
