        >Los Angeles artist David Choe's kaleidoscopic work can be playful,
        confrontational and sexually frank. His personal life is no less
        complicated, as revealed by close friend Harry Kim, who documented
        Choe's life and crimes from 2000 to 2007. From the manic highs of
        commercial success and dinosaur hunting in the Congo to the
        self-destructive lows of Japanese jail sentences and bouts of self-doubt
        and depression, what begins as a gleeful portrait of a bad-boy artist
        slowly becomes a poignant celebration of one man's journey, both
        artistically and spiritually, toward his own uncertain salvation.
