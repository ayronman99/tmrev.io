        >Film about an important episode in Brazilian History: the Araguaya
        guerrilla. In the 1970s, when Brazil was ruled by a military
        dictatorship, some left-wing militants and peasants took arms against
        the Army, in the Amazon. Right in the middle of the conflict, there
        stood a French priest who had come to the region in the 1960s, and got
        involved in the events leading to the rebellion.</image:caption
