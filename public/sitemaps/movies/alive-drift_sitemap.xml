        >E-sports gamer Koichi tries his hand at real-life racing when he is
        contacted by a drift team who is on the verge of shutting down. Koichi
        demonstrates his mastery in a real car, but he is up against
        professional drivers who challenge him in races of life and death.
        Koichi`s blossoming technique, passion, courage, and teamwork break down
        the barriers between the virtual and the real, taking him and his team
        to new extremes.</image:caption
