        >In many ways it was the perfect match: Ernest Hemingway whose heroes
        personified his definition of courage - "grace under pressure" - and
        Gary Cooper, the man who often portrayed those characters on screen. Yet
        in other ways-politically, intellectually, and personally- Hemingway and
        Cooper were a study in contradictions. The story of this extraordinary
        20+ year friendship is the focus of this documentary, the film narrated
        by Sam Waterson, features interviews with such Hollywood luminaries as
        Kirk Douglas, Charlton Heston, George Plimpton, and Patricia
        Neal.</image:caption
