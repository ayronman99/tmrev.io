        >Earth is peaceful following the Tournament of Power. Realizing that the
        universes still hold many more strong people yet to see, Goku spends all
        his days training to reach even greater heights. Then one day, Goku and
        Vegeta are faced by a Saiyan called 'Broly' who they've never seen
        before. The Saiyans were supposed to have been almost completely wiped
        out in the destruction of Planet Vegeta, so what's this one doing on
        Earth? This encounter between the three Saiyans who have followed
        completely different destinies turns into a stupendous battle, with even
        Frieza (back from Hell) getting caught up in the mix.</image:caption
