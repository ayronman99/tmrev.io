        >In the brutal trench fighting of the First World War, a British
        Infantry Company is separated from their regiment after a fierce battle.
        Attempting to return to their lines, the British soldiers discover what
        appears to be a bombed out German trench, abandoned except for a few
        dazed German soldiers. After killing most of the Germans, and taking one
        prisoner, the British company fortifies to hold the trench until
        reinforcements can arrive. Soon, however, strange things being to happen
        as a sense of evil descends on the trench and the British begin turn on
        each other.</image:caption
