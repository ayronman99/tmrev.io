        Maybe because she's blind. What Ferdi doesn't suspect: She's just
        pretending to be blind to be able to live cheaply in subsidized housing.
        How long can she maintain her charade? Can love, which is supposed to
        make you blind, even work out that way? Director Tom Lass takes a closer
        look, shooting with blind actors and old Berlin buddies, acting the lead
        himself – paying tribute to a way of life beyond our way of seeing the
        world.</image:caption
