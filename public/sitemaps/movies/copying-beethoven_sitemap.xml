        >A fictionalised exploration of Beethoven's life in his final days
        working on his Ninth Symphony. It is 1824. Beethoven is racing to finish
        his new symphony. However, it has been years since his last success and
        he is plagued by deafness, loneliness and personal trauma. A copyist is
        urgently needed to help the composer. A fictional character is
        introduced in the form of a young conservatory student and aspiring
        composer named Anna Holtz. The mercurial Beethoven is skeptical that a
        woman might become involved in his masterpiece but slowly comes to trust
        in Anna's assistance and in the end becomes quite fond of her. By the
        time the piece is performed, her presence in his life is an absolute
        necessity. Her deep understanding of his work is such that she even
        corrects mistakes he has made, while her passionate personality opens a
        door into his private world.</image:caption
