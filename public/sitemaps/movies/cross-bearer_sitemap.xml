        >Heather is broke. She has a soul sucking job as a stripper. Her live-in
        girlfriend Victoria has a baby and a coke problem. Her boss Harry is an
        abusive maniac. Life cannot get much worse... or so she thought.
        Determined to get out of this living hell, Heather and her lover, Bunny,
        plan to rip off Harry, ditch Victoria, and leave town to live out their
        days on the Greek islands in peaceful bliss. One big score is all they
        need, and Harry gives them the opportunity when he asks them to take
        care of a drug deal with one of his clients at an old
        warehouse.</image:caption
