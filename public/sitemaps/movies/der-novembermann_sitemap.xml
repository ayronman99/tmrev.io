        >For ten years Lena Drömer has been traveling to Tuscany alone for four
        weeks every November - at least that's what her husband, the Protestant
        pastor Hermann, and her daughter believe. But this time it will be a
        journey without return. Shortly after her departure Lena is killed in a
        bus accident near Bremen. Her death gives up Hermann Rätsel. Why did she
        die in the north, when she wanted to go to the south? When, as every
        year in November, a postcard from Lena arrives from Italy, Hermann sets
        off in search of the truth.</image:caption
