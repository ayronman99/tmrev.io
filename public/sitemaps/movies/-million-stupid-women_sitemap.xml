        >A handful of insults and fighting best friends, not quite the Birthday
        presents every girl hopes for. Melissa s not every girl. She is
        determined to collect insults from all of her past boyfriends before her
        birthday night is over. But her journey to rid herself of her bad
        hook-up karma leads to some pretty strange situations, and by the nights

        start looking up for the insulted party girl, or will she be stuck with
        bad karma for another year?</image:caption
