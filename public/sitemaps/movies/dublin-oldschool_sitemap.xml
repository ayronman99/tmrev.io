        >Join Jason on a chemically enhanced trip through the streets of Dublin
        as he stumbles from one misguided adventure to another. Somewhere
        between the DJs, decks, drug busts and hilltop raves, he stumbles across
        a familiar face from the past, his brother Daniel. Daniel is an educated
        homeless heroin addict living on the streets of Dublin. The brothers
        havenâ€™t seen or spoken to each other in years but over a lost weekend
        they reconnect and reminisce over tunes, trips, their history and their
        city. Two brothers living on the edge but perhaps they have more in
        common than they think.</image:caption
