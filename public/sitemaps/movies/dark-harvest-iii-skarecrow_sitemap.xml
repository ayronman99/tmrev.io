        >Timeline: 1921 - It began in the backwoods of Tennessee, way up in a
        hollow...There lived an old woman who some say she had powers, the kind
        that could curse people. The James Brothers knew of her, these five
        brothers being of the worst kind, evil, vile, and reckless. They wanted
        the old woman's cabin and land for their own. They needed a place
        private to make moonshine. The old woman knew the brothers were going to
        taker her possessions anyway they had to. So she prepared for them an
        evil to beget evil. A curse so powerful she laid upon the brothers and
        any of their kin. Hence the Skarecow became...and the vengence was
        delivered... Timeline: 1981 - Now sixty years later the grandson of
        Willie James has returned to the cabin...and the curse is still very
        much ALIVE!!!!!</image:caption
