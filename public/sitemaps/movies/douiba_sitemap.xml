        >The film is a tale of authentic Moroccan heritage, which tells the
        story of a poor family made up of Father Salem, known as "Zatat", who
        accompanies and guards commercial convoys from bandits. Due to the
        intensity of the father's attachment to his three daughters and his fear
        for them, he stopped working and stayed with them. But one day, he had
        to travel, the fatherâ€™s news disappeared, and the three sisters believed
        that he had perished. Aouisha, the youngest daughter, professes
        deception to take care of her two sisters, and each time the sovereign
        "Moulay Abid" confronts her with a holster of the monument, she escapes
        him because of his excessive intelligence and his
        insight.</image:caption
