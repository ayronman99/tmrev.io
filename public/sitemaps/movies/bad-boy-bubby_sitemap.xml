        >Bad Boy Bubby is just that: a bad boy. So bad, in fact, that his mother
        has kept him locked in their house for his entire thirty years,
        convincing him that the air outside is poisonous. After a visit from his
        estranged father, circumstances force Bubby into the waiting world, a
        place which is just as unusual to him as he is to the
        world.</image:caption
