        >Kari Tellenbach was born with a cleft palate. His mother takes care of
        him like a bird that has fallen out of the nest. As a young man Kari
        decides to become a barber and despite his handicap he wins the heart of
        Annemarie with his humour, charm and sensitivity. His happiness seems
        almost complete – but Annemarie’s middle class parents have already made
        other plans for their daughter.</image:caption
