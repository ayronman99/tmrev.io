        >Bride-to-be Jessie Patterson calls off her third engagement - during
        the ceremony! She swears off serious relationships, until she meets and
        is pursued by Aiden MacTiernan. Aiden, on the other hand, has bet his
        friends he is marriage material, and can find a fianc√© in the four weeks
        leading up to Christmas. When Jessie and Aiden begin to fall for each
        other, Jessie must decide if she is ready for serious love, and Aiden
        must decide if his bet is worth risking his relationship with
        Jessie.</image:caption
