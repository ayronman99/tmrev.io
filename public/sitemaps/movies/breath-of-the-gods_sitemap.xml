        >A Journey to the Origins of Modern Yoga. Yoga is known to go back to
        God Shiva, who perfected 8,4 million postures, according to Indian
        tradition. Far less known is the fact that yoga is at the same time an
        early 20th century-creation of Indian savant T. Krishnamacharya, which
        is what this film is about. Krishnamacharya's life and teachings are
        seen through the eyes of the director on his search for authentic yoga.
        His journey leads him from students and relatives of Krishnamacharya's
        such as the legendary teachers Iyengar and Pattabhi Jois to the source
        of modern yoga: the palace of the Maharaja of Mysore, where
        Krishnamacharya founded the first ever yoga school. A feature-length
        documentary including rare historical footage as well as lavish
        reenactments.</image:caption
