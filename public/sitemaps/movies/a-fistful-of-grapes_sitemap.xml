        >The brothers Michele and Roberto Mannu and their brother-in-law Stefano
        Fais run the Babbudoiu Estate, a wine farm founded in 1948 in the
        surroundings of Sassari. The three partners are totally careless of the
        economic crisis and they waste money organizing lavish conventions for
        the success of their wines. But all this is doomed to an end. As a
        matter of fact the three partners suddenly find out that their company
        has 500,000 euros of debts and they only have 15 days to find the money.
        And it won't be easy: they'll try whatever, with an escalation of
        despair, comic situations, misunderstandings and absurd episodes that
        will lead to nothing. And when all seems to be lost, they find the
        solution which was right under their eyes: a glass of Bianco di
        Babbudoiu.</image:caption
