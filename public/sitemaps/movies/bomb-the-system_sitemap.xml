        >Anthony ‘Blest’ (Mark Webber) is one of the most talented and notorious
        graffiti artists in New York City. Despite the tragic loss of his older
        brother during a nightly 'bombing' foray with a graffiti crew, Anthony
        has the same insatiable addiction. With the other members of his ‘crew,’
        Anthony parties, shoplifts spray-paint and 'tags' virgin walls with his
        signature 'Blest.' He does his best to avoid run-ins with the cops and
        hostile rival crews, but he can’t avoid the pressure from his mother to
        attend college, and from his girlfriend to leave New York with her. As
        tensions rise, a physical threat from the cops causes the crew to
        intensify their bombing excursions, calling an all out war on the city.
        When the inevitable confrontation happens, a tragedy results that pushes
        Anthony to make a decision that has even darker
        consequences.</image:caption
