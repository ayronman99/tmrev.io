        >In 2010 David Crowley, an Iraq veteran, aspiring filmmaker and
        charismatic up-and-coming voice in fringe politics, began production on
        his film Gray State. Set in a dystopian near-future where civil
        liberties are trampled by an unrestrained federal government, the film’s
        crowd funded trailer was enthusiastically received by the burgeoning
        online community of libertarians, Tea Party activists and members of the
        nascent alt-right. In January of 2015, Crowley was found dead with his
        family in their suburban Minnesota home. Their shocking deaths quickly
        become a cause célèbre for conspiracy theorists who speculate that
        Crowley was assassinated by a shadowy government concerned about a film
        and filmmaker that was getting too close to the truth about their
        aims.</image:caption
