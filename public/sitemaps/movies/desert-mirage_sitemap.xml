        >Aspiring cartoonist and middle-aged gumbuster Cliff Morelli (Jeremy
        Koerner, Black Cat Whiskey, New York Lately) spends his days at the
        Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk performing minimum wage janitorial duties.
        When he is put on suspension after harassing a teenager and his parents
        threaten to throw him out of the house, Cliff decides to actively pursue
        his lifelong animation dreams by reconnecting with his rich brother
        Jack. After a failed attempt and a string of bad luck, Cliff finds
        himself at the mercy of the animated characters he has created, and
        together, they form a devilish plan to exact revenge on all those that
        have wronged him.</image:caption
