        >Kristine and her husband Dr. Richard Carlson had an amazing life with
        their two daughters. But when Richard tragically passes away, Kristine
        is knocked off balance. Comfortable with living in Richard’s shadow, she
        is now forced to navigate the unchartered territory of becoming a single
        mom while dealing with pressure to become the new face and voice of the
        “Don’t Sweat the Small Stuff” brand. Looking deep inside herself,
        Kristine comes to understand the true essence of emotional authenticity
        and not sweating the small stuff, which leads to the resilience and
        confidence needed to carry on the legacy of the beloved
        brand.</image:caption
