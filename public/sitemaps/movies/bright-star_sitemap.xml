        >In 1818, high-spirited young Fanny Brawne finds herself increasingly
        intrigued by the handsome but aloof poet John Keats, who lives next door
        to her family friends the Dilkes. After reading a book of his poetry,
        she finds herself even more drawn to the taciturn Keats. Although he
        agrees to teach her about poetry, Keats cannot act on his reciprocated
        feelings for Fanny, since as a struggling poet he has no money to
        support a wife.</image:caption
