        >Cinema a century ago was a new, exciting and highly democratic form of
        entertainment. Picture houses nationwide offered a sociable, lively
        environment in which to relax and escape from the daily grind. With
        feature films still rare, the programme was an entertaining,
        ever-changing roster of short items with live musical accompaniment. 100
        years on, this special compilation from the BFI National Archive
        recreates the glorious miscellany of comedies, dramas, travelogues and
        newsreels which would have constituted a typical night out in 1914. Our
        selection includes a comic short about a face-pulling competition, a
        sensational episode of The Perils of Pauline, scenes of Allied troops
        celebrating Christmas at the Front, and an early sighting of one of
        cinemaâ€™s greatest icons.</image:caption
