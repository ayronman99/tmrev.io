        >Built Upon the Rock is a story of two brothers and how an inheritance
        teaches them about their own foundation and eternal life. In the
        beginning of the video, Gideon is dying and has asked that his two sons,
        Thomas and Sahara work together overseeing his vineyards after he is
        gone. When Gideon dies, Sahara takes control of the vineyards and begins
        to sell grapes that are not yet ripe to loyal customers. Thomas is
        greatly disturbed and seeks out a lawyer named Josiah to help him regain
        his part of his inheritance. Josiah has left law practice to follow
        Jesus. He encourages Thomas to listen to the words of Jesus to find the
        answers to his problems. Jesus is giving his sermon on the mount and
        shares the beatitudes, or the actions, attitudes and blessings true
        believers should experience. He tells the people they need to go beyond
        just believing and act upon their faith. Jesus uses the parable of the
        wise man who built his house upon a rock...</image:caption
