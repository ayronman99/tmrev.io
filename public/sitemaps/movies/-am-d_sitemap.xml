        >Thailand's latest horror omnibus is made up of three chilling stories.
        Two sisters who own a wig shop are haunted by a female ghost whose hair
        were made into one of the wigs on sale. A funeral home employee falls in
        love with a female corpse who died alongside her fiance in an accident
        just before their wedding. Two company directors who love playing scary
        pranks on their employees finally get their comeuppance when they
        themselves face a real ghost. Three stories set at 3 AM, the scariest
        hour of the night, where all spirits are free to roam.</image:caption
