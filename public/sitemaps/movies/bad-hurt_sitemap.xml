        >Elaine and Ed Kendall have more than their share of grief and
        suffering. Once a young couple in love they now struggle for a sense of
        stability in their Staten Island home. Their eldest son is suffering
        from the physical and psychological effects of war; his younger brother
        takes it upon himself to bring him peace and relief. Meanwhile, their
        special needs daughter brings another kind of chaos to the family. Even
        though Ed and Elaine explore options for her care, theyâ€™re really just
        hanging on to hope that things improve somehow.</image:caption
