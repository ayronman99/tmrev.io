        >Pupul is twelve years old. But, instead of studying and playing like
        other twelve year old, the only thing that interests him is solving
        cases. His two friends, Tatai and Bhebli, are equally enthusiastic on
        being sleuths and assisting Pupul. Pupul calls himself Captain Spark ,
        roams around with a toy pistol and dreams of possessing a durbin
        (binocular), which, according to him, will make him a real detective. So
        when his uncle presents him one on his birthday, disaster strikes.
        Looking through the durbin, Pupul witnesses a murder and decides to
        catch the culprit.</image:caption
