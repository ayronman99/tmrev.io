        >Three hours outside of Addis Ababa, a bright 14-year-old girl is on her
        way home from school when men on horses swoop in and kidnap her. The
        brave Hirut grabs a rifle and tries to escape, but ends up shooting her
        would-be husband. In her village the practice of abduction into marriage
        is common and one of Ethiopia’s oldest traditions. Meaza Ashenafi, an
        empowered and tenacious young lawyer, arrives from the city to represent
        Hirut and argue that she acted in self defense. Meaza boldly embarks on
        a collision course between enforcing civil authority and abiding by
        customary law, risking the ongoing work of her women’s legal aid
        practice to save Hirut’s life.</image:caption
