        >Gong Pil-du is a detective recruited for his athletic skills and
        achievement, a bronze Universiade medalist in wrestling. Since then,
        however, he has had little success in his career, and remains a 40-year
        old bachelor with a terrible credit record. His greatest crisis comes
        when his beloved father needs money for crucial surgery. To get the
        money, Gong makes a deal with a vicious crime boss. This makes him more
        miserable than ever, as he is now suspected as a corrupt cop. Gong goes
        on a quest to prove his innocence. Will he be successful for once in his
        life?</image:caption
