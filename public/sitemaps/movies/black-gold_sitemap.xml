        >On the Arabian Peninsula in the 1930s, two warring leaders come face to
        face. The victorious Nesib, Emir of Hobeika, lays down his peace terms
        to rival Amar, Sultan of Salmaah. The two men agree that neither can lay
        claim to the area of no man’s land between them called The Yellow Belt.
        In return, Nesib adopts Amar’s two boys Saleeh and Auda as a guarantee
        against invasion. Twelve years later, Saleeh and Auda have grown into
        young men. Saleeh, the warrior, itches to escape his gilded cage and
        return to his father’s land. Auda cares only for books and the pursuit
        of knowledge. One day, their adopted father Nesib is visited by an
        American from Texas. He tells the Emir that his land is blessed with oil
        and promises him riches beyond his wildest imagination. Nesib imagines a
        realm of infinite possibility, a kingdom with roads, schools and
        hospitals all paid for by the black gold beneath the barren sand. There
        is only one problem. The precious oil is located in the Yellow
        Belt.</image:caption
