        >Atlantis is known across the world as a myth. But is this really the
        truth? No matter what cultural history we explore, we discover a story
        very similar to the one we know about Atlantis...why? For years, experts
        and researchers have been looking in the wrong place, at the wrong
        people and for the wrong thing. For too long historians have focused on
        a few words left to us by Plato whose meaning they misunderstood. The
        fact is, even Plato didn't understand what had been told to him. The
        startling truth is that the remnants of Atlantis are all around us right
        now and have been for a very long time - long before recorded history.
        New research and insight exposes Atlantis to be a pivotal part of our
        ancient beginnings. The legendary lost city that many think of as myth,
        was in fact a very real and highly advanced civilization that was
        uniquely aware of the laws of the universe and was able to access hidden
        dimensions and make contact with extraterrestrial races.</image:caption
