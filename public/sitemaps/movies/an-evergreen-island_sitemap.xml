        >In 1989, the landowners of Central Bougainville closed one of the
        world's largest copper mines that was destroying their land. It remains
        closed to this day. In response, a blockade was imposed around the
        island. From scratch, the Bougainvilleans built their own schools, they
        revived their traditional bush medicines, they used solar and hydro
        power to generate electricity, but the most fascinating invention was
        the use of fermented coconut oil as a substitute for fuel. "An Evergreen
        Island" is a story of courage, survival and persistence - of
        inventiveness, imagination and creativity on a little-known Pacific
        island.</image:caption
