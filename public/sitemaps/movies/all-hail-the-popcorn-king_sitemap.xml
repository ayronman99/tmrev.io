        >Made in cooperation with Joe Lansdale, we explore his life growing up
        in 1950's east Texas and how he has used his experiences to create what
        can only be described as his own genre. Our interviews with Joe, his
        family, friends, fans and colleagues gives us a glimpse into the man
        behind Bubba Ho-tep, Hap and Leonard, and incident on and off a mountain
        road among dozens of other books, films, comics and stories. We discover
        his dedication to martial arts and his decades of generosity offering
        advice to aspiring writers and creators.</image:caption
