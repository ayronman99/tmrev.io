        >The BFI's fascinating collection of 60 short films all made before 1911
        aims to give wider access to some of the extraordinary film material
        held in the BFI National Archive, much of which has been restored.
        Although most films made at this time were actualities and newsreels,
        this collection contains mostly fiction films, ranging from the dramatic
        to the comic and the fantastical.</image:caption
