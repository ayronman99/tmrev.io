        >Sweet and savvy talking golden retriever, Bailey, is one doggone lucky
        pooch when his devoted owner, Constance Pennington, leaves him her
        entire billion-dollar fortune. Bailey is lucky, that is, until he
        becomes the target of an elaborately-designed dognap scheme hatched by
        Constance's nasty nephew Caspar and his money-hungry wife Dolores. The
        despicable duo's wicked plan is to ultimately gain custody of the canine
        so they can get their greedy paws on his inheritance. Unfortunately for
        them, there's a thing or two they don't know about Bailey. Not only does
        he have great street smarts, he has great pals too. Bailey's loyal
        guardian Ted, kind-hearted animal advocate Marge, her daughter Sam, and
        a clever border collie named Tessa set out on a hilarious madcap
        adventure to free their four-legged friend and put the nasty dognappers
        out of business-for good!</image:caption
