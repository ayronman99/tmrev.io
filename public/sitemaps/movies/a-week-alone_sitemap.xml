        >Maria is a girl in her early teens whose family lives in an upscale
        gated suburb. Maria's parents are going out of town for a week, and
        rather than leave her with relatives or hire a babysitter, Maria is put
        in charge of looking after her little sister Sofia, with housekeeper
        Esther serving as a nominal adult authority figure, though for the most
        part she lets Maria and the others do what they please. With only their
        parents bedroom off-limits, Maria and Sofia have the run of the house,
        and soon they and their friends Facundo, Quique, Rodrigo and Timmy are
        spending their days exploring the place. As the kids begin creating
        their own rules to run counter to the ones their absent parents set
        down, Esther brings a young relative, Fernando, to play with them, and
        the privileged kids begin to get a notion of the ways of the outside
        world.</image:caption
