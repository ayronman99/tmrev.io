        >On September 11 and 12, 2007, singer / songwriter / guitarist Ani
        DiFranco played two sold-out shows before a hometown audience in
        Buffalo, New York. What made those nights so special wasn’t just the
        music—because that’s always special at an Ani show—but the fact that she
        was playing the inaugural shows in her very own venue, a downtown church
        once slated for demolition that has been beautifully restored as a
        state-of-the-art music hall and newly renamed “Babeville.” Ani took the
        opportunity to fashion a two-night retrospective of sorts, performing
        songs from every stage of her fabled career in breathtaking new
        arrangements with her latest touring band; Allison Miller on drums, Todd
        Sickafoose on upright bass and Mike Dillon on vibes and percussion. The
        spirit of celebration was in the air, and energy in the room-both
        onstage and in the audience—was extraordinary.</image:caption
