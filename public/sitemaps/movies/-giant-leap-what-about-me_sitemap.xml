        >One Giant Leap have created a unique music, TV and film project. What
        About Me? is the culmination of 4 years work visiting 50 global
        locations collecting wisdom and musical jewels. It's an inspiring and
        alarming look at our collective insanity: how we are ego-driven, needy
        in relationships, insatiable in desire, addicted to status, wounded by
        childhood and unable to stop thinking, but how we still manage to be
        inspired and creative. Unscripted, with no storyboard, these
        conversations all reveal how we are connected not only through our
        creativity and our beliefs but most of all through our madness!
