        >When Emily complains that she's having trouble writing a poem for a
        school assignment, her dinosaur pal Barney recruits his good friend
        Mother Goose for a one-on-one tutorial about rhythm and rhyme. The
        fun-to-follow curriculum features a lineup of nursery rhyme standards
        and sing-along favorites, including "Baa Baa Black Sheep," "London
        Bridge," "Old King Cole," "Little Boy Blue" and "The Old Lady in the
        Shoe."</image:caption
