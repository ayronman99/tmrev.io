        >Mehmet is a man living with his family in a mountain village in the
        Black Sea region. He earns his living by breeding a few animals, while
        passionately looking for a mineral reserve on the mountains, but his
        pursuit is seen useless by his family. Devastated by vain efforts, his
        hope is renewed with a competition. Mehmet will attend the bull fight
        held in Artvin, but he returns from Artvin completely lost, once again.
        This simple story pictures the naive portrait of a touching life, a life
        struggle in hardship and the relationship between nature, animals and
        human beings.</image:caption
