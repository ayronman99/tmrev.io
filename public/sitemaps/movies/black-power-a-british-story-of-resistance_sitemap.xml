        >An examination of the Black Power movement in the late 1960s in the UK,
        surveying both the individuals and the cultural forces that defined the
        era. At the heart of the documentary is a series of astonishing
        interviews with past activists, many of whom are speaking for the first
        time about what it was really like to be involved in the British Black
        Power movement, bringing to life one of the key cultural revolutions in
        the history of the nation.</image:caption
