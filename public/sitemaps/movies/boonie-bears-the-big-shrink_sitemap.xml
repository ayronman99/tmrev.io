        >Briar and Bramble, two bear brothers who constantly annoy Vick, are
        about to have a rude awakening. Vick goes to meet them to make them
        disappear and remove them from his life. During the commotion, all three
        are caught in by a shrink ray and miniaturized. The tiny team must
        return to the device to reverse the effects, but their efforts are
        thwarted by Vick's father. All three of them embark on a crazy race
        through a beautiful world, right under our feet, not only to return to
        their right , but also to find their families.</image:caption
