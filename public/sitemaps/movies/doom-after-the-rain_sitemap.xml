        wrecked world can be unpredictable but the results are worse to stand. A
        rain all of a sudden divide mankind apart. The ones who get wet in the
        rain and else. The ones get in the rain lose their minds. A handful of
        people, trying to protect themselves against both the rain and also the
        “crackheads” Someone named this as the doomsday. Who get crazy? The ones
        who get wet in the rain? or, The ones who suppose they don’t? It’s no
        matter why it rains, it’s the protection effort of the people against
        the rain.</image:caption
