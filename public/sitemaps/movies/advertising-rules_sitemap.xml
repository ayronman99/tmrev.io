        >Edward Kaminsky, an aging ad man, wants a golden parachute from his
        agency; he must first land the Opel auto contract. Rosa, a youth with
        wealthy parents, wants to establish herself as an artist. The clumsy and
        enthusiastic Viktor, not quite honest, wants work. When he wanders into
        Kaminsky's meeting with Opel and says something about irony, the Opel
        director wants him in on the campaign. Then he steals an idea from Rosa
        that the Opel director loves. Before Rosa discovers he's expropriated
        her idea, Rosa and Viktor become lovers. Father-son feelings materialize
        between Kaminsky and Viktor. Can the impulsive Viktor hold it together
        before Rosa learns the truth and flies away?</image:caption
