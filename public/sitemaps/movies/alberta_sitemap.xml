        >Freek is a 49-year-old advertising executive and media figure. He
        appears to have it all: he has won many awards in his field, has a great
        wife Iris and a ten year old adopted son Werner. Iris is 39 and a strong
        partner, professionally and personally. She's beautiful, smart and a
        workaholic. Freek is known in the advertising world as a charmer and
        womanizer. He meets a dazzling young woman, the 24-year-old Alberta,
        whom he falls for. She persuades him to go to the place she shares a
        name with; Alberta, in the Canadian Rockies. The plan is to escape life
        in the Netherlands and paint expressionistic landscapes of the Canadian
        scenery together. Boredom strikes sooner than anticipated and Alberta
        goes in search of adventure elsewhere, leaving Freek hopeless and alone.
        Can he handle life on his own?</image:caption
