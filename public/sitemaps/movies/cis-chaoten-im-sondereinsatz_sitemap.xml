        >Lukas Maler is a butcher. Albeit more out of necessity than out of
        passion: As the “Karajan with the scalpel”, his vocation was always
        forensic medicine. When he accidently destroyed all evidence against the
        “24-hour-killer”, his career as a coroner was done for. And not far from
        it was his marriage with his great love Diana, whom he could not offer
        anything anymore as a broken man. But Lukas gets a second chance when
        once again a serial killer terrifies the city because the murders
        resemble those of the “24-hour-killer”. Diana – who has ascended to head
        of the forensic institute in the meantime – knows that only the best one
        can solve the case. But he is not available. And so, she gets the
        second-best one: the most over-qualified butcher in town…</image:caption
