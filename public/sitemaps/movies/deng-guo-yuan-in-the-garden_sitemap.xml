        >During a trip to China with Vincent to meet people in art schools and
        universities, I discovered the work of Deng Guo Yan, the director of the
        Tianjin school of contemporary art. A painting style that seemed to me
        to be a mix of traditional Chinese painting, Claude Monet and Cy
        Twombly, and which I liked. The black and white of his large ink brush
        paintings on paper, almost the size of a mural, made it possible for me
        to jump from black and white to colour in this film, as I had done in
        the Recueil but with other connotations: with excerpts from Jean Renoir
        in Aline Cézanne, photos of Le Havre destroyed in Papa, Maman, Perret et
        moi, and infrared images taken by Georges-Arthur Goldschmidt in Le
        Paysage pour témoin”.</image:caption
