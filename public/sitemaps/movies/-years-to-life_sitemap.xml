        >First of all, the title does not refer to someone sentenced to jail. It
        is a movie about 6 lifetime friends who are all hitting the big `3-0'
        together during the same year. Each one looks inside themselves to see
        where has my life gone and what am I going to do with my future.
        Actually, what I saw was a black Seinfeld comedy. Tracy Morgan, who is
        one of the main characters, is a struggling comedian just like Jerry
        Seinfeld. He gives his opinion of what women want in a man in one of his
        comedy routines. Melissa De Sousa is looking for a man before time runs
        out. She is just like Elaine in Seinfeld. I don't remember the big
        problem with turning thirty, however, all the characters in this movie
        can show you what they are, such as not having fame, riches, a husband,
        a thin body, and staying young. Their life stories are probably repeated
        many times around the world.</image:caption
