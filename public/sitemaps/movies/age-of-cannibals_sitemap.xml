        >Öllers and Niederländer have everything under control. For the past six
        years, the two successful business consultants have been traveling
        through some of the seediest countries around the world in order to
        satisfy their clients greed. They have achieved almost everything, but
        there is one career move left: to finally become a partner in the
        company! When they find out that their team colleague Hellinger made the
        cut, they are at their wits end. Up or Out is the name of the game. The
        fact that Hellinger falls from an office window for no explainable
        reason doesnt seem to help the situation. Of all people, the young and
        ambitious Bianca steps in for Hellinger. Öllers and Niederländer are
        irritated, sarcasm spreads, neuroses break out. The fight for survival
        within the company takes its toll the AGE OF CANNIBALS
        dawns.</image:caption
