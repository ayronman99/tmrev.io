        >Known as one of the best and most prolific comedians working today,
        Christopher Titus releases his sixth 90-minute comedy special, The Angry
        Pursuit of Happiness, his best performance to date. The show takes the
        audience on a wild ride from Titus’ solution to the world’s problems,he
        fixes everything in a way you wont believe, to his insight on “Here’s
        how life goes” to his ‘me-logy,’ where Titus gives his own eulogy. Titus
        takes this special to new comedic places he hasn’t gone yet. At an hour
        and 45 minutes it’s double what a normal special brings, as Titus says
        “We need comedy to get rid of our desire to kill”</image:caption
