        >Martin has not worked as a cook since the accidental death of his wife,
        with whom he ran a restaurant. The single father manages himself and his
        little daughter Katrin as a taxi driver. When the strict judge Annemarie
        withdrew his taxi license because of a minor offense, Martin had to hire
        himself out as Nikolaus at the Christmas market. The picky paragraph
        rider constantly runs into him. He would love to give her his opinion -
        instead the spark jumps over. It is well known that love goes through
        the stomach. But to do this, Martin would finally have to do what he
        does best: cook.</image:caption
