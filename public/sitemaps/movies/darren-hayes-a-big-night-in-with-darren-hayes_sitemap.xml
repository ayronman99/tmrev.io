        >A Big Night in with Darren Hayes, was recorded in the Concert Hall of
        the Sydney Opera House in Sydney, Australia in July 2006. It was the
        third tour undertaken by Australian singer-songwriter Darren Hayes as a
        solo artist. The tour was undertaken to celebrate the release of Savage
        Garden's 10th anniversary greatest hits album. The staging for the tour
        was simple, with a 'living room' feel, featuring a bar, dining area and
        wardrobe. The show featured a great deal of audience
        participation.</image:caption
