        >Pinocchio 964 is a memory-wiped sex slave who is thrown out by his
        owners for failure to maintain an erection. It is unclear in what ways
        he has been modified beyond having no memory and being unable to
        communicate. He is discovered by Himiko while wandering aimlessly
        through the city. Himiko has also been memory-wiped, possibly by the
        same company that produced Pinocchio, but she is fully functional.
        Himiko spends her days drawing maps of the city, to aid other
        memory-wiped people. Himiko takes Pinocchio home and tries to teach him
        to speak. After much effort he has a breakthrough and finally becomes
        aware of his situation. At this point his body erupts in an inexplicable
        metamorphosis and it becomes clear that his modifications were much more
        involved and esoteric than simple memory loss. Himiko also begins to
        transform, though in a much more subtle manner.</image:caption
