        >The definitive documentary about wrestling legend Dynamite Kid and his
        impact in the world of professtional wrestling. What resulted was a very
        emotional journey into a career cut short by the abuses of steroids,
        alcohol, drugs, and a complete disregard for his own physical
        limitations. Dynamite Kid started as a young Englishmen trained in the
        infamous Snake Pit by Ted Betely and turned an opportunity given to him
        by the Hart Family in Calgary into a phenomenal worldwide wrestling
        career. Dynamite Kid was on the front lines of changing professional
        wrestling from a big man carnival act into an exciting action based
        entertainment industry where lightweight and physically gifted
        performers were the focal point of the show. He dazzled an international
        audience with matches against Tiger Mask that are still a bench mark
        today.</image:caption
