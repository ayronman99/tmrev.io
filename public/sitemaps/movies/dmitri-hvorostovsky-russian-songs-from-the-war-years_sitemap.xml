        >A magnificent concert event. As the Russian journalist Elena Karakoleva
        writes, "These songs were known and loved by everybody in this country.
        A number of highly talented composers and poets were among their
        authors, and no Soviet family get-together could pass without these
        songs being sung by all of the guests.... [This concert] given by Dmitri
        Hvorostovsky in the vast 6,500 seat hall of the State Kremlin Palace in
        Moscow [made us feel] happy and united, because the music reminded us of
        the meaning of life and of our great cultural heritage." Booklet
        includes complete texts and translations. 59 minutes, 2003, Color,
        Stereo.</image:caption
