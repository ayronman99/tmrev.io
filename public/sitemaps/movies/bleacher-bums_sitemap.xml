        >Adapted from a 1979 stage play written by Chicago's Organic Theater
        Company, BLEACHER BUMS details the exploits of a group of baseball fans
        as they sit in the bleachers of Lakeview Park watching a game between
        the hometown Bruins take on the St. Louis Eagles. Marvin (Brad Garrett)
        and Decker (Peter Riegert) gamble. So does Zig (Wayne Knight), even
        though his wife constantly nags him about the money he loses. Meanwhile,
        blind Greg (Matt Craven) enjoys the game through pretty Melody (Sarain
        Boylan), who describes it to him. A seasoned ensemble case of TV and
        film veterans create winning chemistry in this slice-of-life
        comedy.</image:caption
