        >Producer Allison Tripp wakes up dazed and confused in an LAPD safe
        house. When Detective Mark Janus asks her about the dead bodies found in
        a Los Angeles warehouse she begins to remember... they had been shooting
        an ultra-low budget movie for infamous producer Ozzie Felcher when men
        with guns had come by and massacred the entire cast and crew. Janus is
        relentless in his questioning. He wants to know everything, before the
        trail to the killers gets cold. The more she talks the more she is
        forced to relive the nightmare</image:caption
