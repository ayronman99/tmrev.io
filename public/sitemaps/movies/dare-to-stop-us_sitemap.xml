        >In Spring 1969, 21-year-old Megumi Yoshizumi goes to Wakamatsu
        Production. The company makes films popular with young people. Pink film
        director Koji Wakamatsu gathers there with young talented people who are
        all fascinated with movie making. When they are not making movies, they
        spend their time smoking, drinking alcohol, scouting for actresses and
        looking for material for their next film. When filming begins, everybody
        immerses themselves into the production and will do everything on the
        filming set from running, shouting to acting.</image:caption
