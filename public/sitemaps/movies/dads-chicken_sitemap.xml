        >Black Jesus just can’t take it any more. He hates his dying wife and
        his transsexual son - but not for the reasons you think. She won’t let
        him obsessively cut coupons, and he/she fetishizes guns to the point of
        distraction. His other daughter is a dope fiend, and his recently
        deceased father was an out and out pervert. And don’t even bring up
        autistic child prodigy Hobie. Desperate to play the violin, the
        partially blind boy spends his days roaming around the city, instrument
        in hand and toilet paper tube up to his bad eye. When the youthful
        talent meets European Ernie, it seems like everything will be all right.
        He coaches the child, and even suggests someone who might be able to
        teach him a thing or two. In the meantime, Mom and the sexually confused
        Shamu build a bomb. With Black Jesus out of the house, they intend to
        avenge the cultural attacks on religion once and for all.</image:caption
