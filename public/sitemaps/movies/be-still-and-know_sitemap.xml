        >19-year old CJ, has lost touch with her childhood friend, Sophia, ever
        since she left small-town Willow Springs for college the year prior.
        Realizing how much they've grown apart, Sophia insists that CJ spends
        fall break at her grandfather's cabin, where they used to spend summers
        together. Reluctant, CJ gathers her new group of friends to join her for
        a fall escape they won't soon forget. Jocelyn and Amber, city girls at
        heart, embrace the wooded retreat but their excitement quickly turns to
        dread when they discover a vagabond living in a run-down trailer on the
        property.</image:caption
