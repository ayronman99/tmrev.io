        >Sivaraman belongs to a low caste and is a cobbler by profession. He was
        orphaned as a little boy and has since been brought up by a couple
        belonging to the lower caste. A trip to the 'agraharam' brings back
        memories of his childhood and he realises that he is in fact a Brahmin
        and the son of the head priest at the temple. Wishing to help his real
        family while at the same time unable to forget the parents who adopted
        him, he shuffles between the two vastly different worlds. Maheswar, a
        lower caste woman, waits for him back home while Gayatri falls in love
        with him in his new life.</image:caption
