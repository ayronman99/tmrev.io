        >An Australian shopper phoning Coles Myer, an English housewife ringing
        Harrods and a New York stockbroker calling American Express all have one
        thing in common―their customer service queries are likely to be
        re-routed to India and answered by Indians impersonating local

        and set-up costs are low yet the staff is keen and highly educated.
