        >Bud Spencer plays Banana Joe, a brawny yet friendly man who lives in a
        small rainforest village called Amantido with a huge number of his own
        children and regularly delivers bananas to a South American river port
        (hence his name). One day, the henchmen of a local gangster boss named
        Torsillo come ashore in Amantido to initiate the construction a banana
        processing plant. Of course, Joe (in typical direct-approach manner)
        evicts the goons, who promptly return to their boss. Torsillo finds out
        that Joe is trading bananas without a license and decides to exploit it.
        Upon his next delivery, Joe is apprehended by the police and given the
        choice of either acquiring a legal license or getting his boat taken
        away and himself arrested for illegal shipment. Joe travels to the
        nearest city, which to him is a new world, as he grew up in the
        rainforest.</image:caption
