        >On the night of Oct. 2, 2005, Hart and Dana Perry's 15-year-old son
        Evan jumped to his death from his New York City bedroom window. This
        moving film is the story, told by his filmmaker parents and others who
        knew him, of Evanâ€™s life and death, and his life-long struggle with
        bipolar disorder. It delves into the complexity of Evan's disease,
        sharing his family's journey through the maze of mental illness. In
        showing how one family deals with generations of loss and grief, the
        film defies the stigma related to mental illness and suicide and tells a
        human story that touches everyone.</image:caption
