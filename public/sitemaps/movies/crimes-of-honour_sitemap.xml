        >Throughout the Islamic world, each year hundreds of women are shot,
        stabbed, strangled or burned to death by male relatives because they are
        thought to have “dishonoured” their families. They may have lost their
        virginity, refused an arranged marriage or left an abusive husband. Even
        if a woman is raped or merely the victim of gossip, she must pay the
        price. Crimes of Honour documents the terrible reality of femicide – the
        belief that a girl’s body is the property of the family, and any
        suggestion of sexual impropriety must be cleansed with her blood. We
        meet women in hiding from their families, a brother who describes his
        reasons for killing the sister he loved, and a handful of women who have
        committed themselves to the protection of young women in danger of
        losing their lives.</image:caption
