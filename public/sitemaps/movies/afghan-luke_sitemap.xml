        >Disheartened when his story about Canadian snipers possibly mutilating
        corpses in Afghanistan is buried, Luke (Nick Stahl) quits his job but is
        even more determined to return to Afghanistan to get the real story.
        With his offbeat buddy, Tom (Nicolas Wright), tagging along, Luke
        returns to Afghanistan and intends to gather enough evidence to get his
        old story into print. But he soon finds that the country is an even more
        dangerous place than when he left. To make matters worse, his old friend
        and fixer, Mateen (Stephen Lobo) has been hired away by Luke's
        journalistic nemesis, Imran Sahar (Vik Sahay). Soon the trip for Luke
        and Tom in Afghanistan turns into a surreal and perilous adventure, a
        journey into an alternate reality, filtered through a haze of gun
        smoke.</image:caption
