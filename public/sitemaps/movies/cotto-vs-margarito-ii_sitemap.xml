        >Miguel Cotto lived up to his promise. At the final news conference,
        Cotto warned Antonio Margarito, "I'm going to slap you like a little
        girl." I'm pretty sure Cotto hits harder than most little girls, and
        Margarito would probably agree. Cotto dominated for most of the match,
        and eventually won on a technical knockout in nine rounds. As with all
        boxing matches, there are plenty of things to be learned about each
        fighter. As a result, I have compiled a list of four things we learned
        from Saturday night. Feel free to let me know what you think about the
        list, or the fight itself</image:caption
