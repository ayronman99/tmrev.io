        >Broadway: The Golden Age is the most important, ambitious and
        comprehensive film ever made about America's most celebrated indigenous
        art form. Award-winning filmmaker Rick McKay filmed over 100 of the
        greatest stars ever to work on Broadway or in Hollywood. He soon learned
        that great films can be restored, fine literature can be kept in print -
        but historic Broadway performances of the past are the most endangered.
        They leave only memories that, while more vivid, are more difficult to
        preserve. In their own words — and not a moment too soon — Broadway: The
        Golden Age tells the stories of our theatrical legends, how they came to
        New York, and how they created this legendary century in American
        theatre. This is the largest cast of legends ever in one
        film.</image:caption
