        >AMERICAN EMPIRE is an indictment on the country that has supposedly
        nurtured us, but is slowly destroying us. Beginning with the founding of
        the Federal Reserve our economy is controlled by a system of debt and
        inflation. It has become an economic empire that is destroying our
        planet and all its natural resources driven by a relentless need to
        amass money and power. How can we let this happen! How can we as a
        people, allow these so called officials get away with it? Who is
        benefiting and why? Their actions have affected our food, our health,
        and our very freedom! We have become both the enablers and sadly, the
        victims! This no-holds-barred documentary dares to lay bare the real
        truth behind the AMERICAN EMPIRE!</image:caption
