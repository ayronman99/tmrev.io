        >Sakshi is eight months pregnant with her first child when she and
        Hemant are forced out of their home. They escape from the city and seek
        refuge in a house located deep inside sugarcane fields. The house is
        ridden with dark secrets that start unravelling as the story unfolds,
        posing a threat to Sakshi and her unborn child. Even as Sakshi tries to
        save herself and her unborn baby, scary sightings of three mysterious
        kids and a charred monster coupled with an eerie lullaby, emanating from
        an old transistor, wreak havoc with her sanity.</image:caption
