        >Police officer in the Southern Precinct, WU Ying-xiong, has been
        revered as a hero in the Harbor City ever since he stopped the
        terrorists on a Boeing 777 airplane and kept the city safe.
        Unfortunately, the peace is only temporaryâ€¦ Panic spreads the whole city
        as a series of bomb explosions happen within hours and this is just the
        beginning of a tight-knit conspiracy. Facing the unprecedented crisis,
        the two-men team of totally opposite characteristics is the only hope to
        reverse the situation. Nonetheless, when moral standards are turned
        upside down, what faith should they keep to maintain the so-called
        justice?</image:caption
