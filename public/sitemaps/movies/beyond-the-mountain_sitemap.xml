        >In a quite mountain temple Chim-hae follows a path of asceticism under
        the instruction of the High Priest, Pop-yon. One day, the high priest
        sends him on an errand to another mountain temple known as Sowondang.
        Sowondang was widely renowned for the beautiful Buddhist nun, Myo-hon
        who lived there. On Chi,-hae's way back he spots the delightful Myo-hon
        in the distance. From that moment he realizes her existence is
        overpowering to his. Days later, his craving is fulfilled when he gets
        to meet her in their mist at Sowondang. They are immediately attracted
        to each other in this wonderful first rendezvous. However, they foresee
        a grim future lying ahead. While returning to his temple, Chim-hae gets
        lost in the mist causing great concern and confusion among the other
        followers. Three days later Chim-hae awakes to find himself at home in
        the temple after having been rescued by the monk. Known as Mubul who had
        found him in the mountains.</image:caption
