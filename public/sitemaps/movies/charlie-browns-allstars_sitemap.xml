        >After their humiliating 999th defeat, Charlie Brown's whole baseball
        team quits on him. All seems lost...until Charlie Brown learns that his
        team can join the Little League and become an official team with real
        uniforms! But as the team's enthusiasm sparks, Charlie Brown learns that
        neither girls nor Snoopy would be allowed to play. Charlie Brown faces
