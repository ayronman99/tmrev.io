        >During the British rule in India, several Indians were lured by the
        British to travel to distant Mauritius where they would have a better
        life. Upon reaching this island, the Indians were enslaved, tortured and
        made to labor in what is now known as the "Coolie Ghat". After the
        British left India, the Indians in Mauritius decided to continue to live
        there along with other nationals from different
        countries.</image:caption
