        >Bob Friends (Michael Waite) is a thirty-something salesman who works
        two jobs and lives with his sister. He has a dream of opening a fast
        food restaurant for kids selling only pink and blue food. When his boss
        (Evan R. Press) tells him to spend a few days with the company's top
        seller, Stephanie (Gheree O'Bannon), he accidentally gets involved with
        an eccentric con woman named Verushka (Yelena Danova) instead. She
        implicates Bob in her daffy get-rich-quick schemes, usually on the wrong
        side of the law. By the time he figures it all out, he's fallen for her
        charms.</image:caption
