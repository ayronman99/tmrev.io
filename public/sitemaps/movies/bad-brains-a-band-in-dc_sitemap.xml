        >Bad Brains are one of the most important and influential American bands
        still working today. They melded punk and reggae into an innovative
        style that has yet to be copied. Their impact and influence can be heard
        in groups like Beastie Boys, No Doubt, Nirvana, Jane's Addiction and
        countless more. Despite the troubles of an eccentric front man they have
        stayed together for 30 years without ever reaching the level of success
        so many think they deserve. Using rare archival footage and original
        comic illustrations the film re-constructs Bad Brains' rich and
        complicated history.</image:caption
