        >For Kathleen, Christmas has always been an unwelcome reminder of her
        father’s abandonment almost 30 years ago. Although she has tried to
        forget her past, it has not forgotten her. In the days leading up to
        Christmas un unforgiving blizzard traps her in her own home with two
        unlikely roommates. Same, a gentle older man Kathleen took in for the
        night and Lucy, the daughter of her soon to be fiancé bring her face to
        face with the hurts of her past. Will she be able to let go and grab
        hold of a life-changing forgiveness or will she continue to be haunted
        by the pain of the past?</image:caption
