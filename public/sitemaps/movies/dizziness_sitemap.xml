        >In the final scene of my last work, A SILENT DAY, a girl was filming
        herself with an 8mm camera on a railway bridge. Although the film
        doesnâ€™t depict the incident, she later jumped off the bridge in an
        attempt to kill herself. Two girls witnessed her attempted suicide, and
        in this film I am attempting to depict the broken state of their
        psyches. In this piece, various images have been generated as a result
        of my professional interaction with a number of young people with mental
        illnesses, and the unstable state of mind which I have often experienced
        in recent days - Takashi Ito</image:caption
