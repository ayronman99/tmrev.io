        >Six years after her son went missing, dedicated mother Jung-Yeon still
        hasn't lost hope - even after her husband's shocking accident while
        rushing to follow up on a potential sighting. Although she's in
        mourning, drowned in despair for her losses, she doesn't give up. Just
        when everything feels like it's in vain, she hears about a young boy
        living in a fishing community outside the city who seems to resemble her
        lost son. Facing strange surroundings and corrupt cops covering up child
        abuse, Jung-yeon may not be able to handle all the obstacles in her way,
        let alone fend for herself.</image:caption
