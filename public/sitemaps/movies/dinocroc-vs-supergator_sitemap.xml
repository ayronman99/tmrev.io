        >On a lush tropical island, working under a secret government charter,
        Martin Drake has not only grown sprawling acres of giant vegetables, but
        inadvertently spawned two mammoth reptiles as well. Now they've broken
        free of their enclosures, and Drake has only one option: kill the
        creatures before word gets back to Washington and they close him down.
        When Drake's first team of well-armed mercenaries gets wiped out within
        hours of setting down in the jungle, he turns to one lone hunter, The
        Cajun, to go in single-handedly. But will The Cajun be cunning enough to
        find the creatures and destroy them before they turn the blue waters red
        with the blood of tourists. The only hope is to bring the monsters
        together and make them fight. When one emerges victorious, that will be
        the time to strike and kill the other. It's a risky plan, but ultimately
        the only one that may work. One of David Carradine's last
        movies.</image:caption
