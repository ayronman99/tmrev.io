        >This DVD presents the last night of Cliff's 70th birthday week of shows
        at The Royal Albert Hall in London, October 2010. This is a different
        kind of show from Cliff; a show featuring a swing band (the titular
        brass), a different take on old songs, and a host of songs he has never
        sung before. Fans have known for years that Cliff has been interested in
        doing something like this. Indeed, he tried out the formula in his 40th
        anniversary show (also at Royal Albert Hall) and others.</image:caption
