        >Subhamoy is a widower and he has two children Munni and Gaurav who is
        an extremely talented cricketer, but extremely dull when it comes to
        studies. He is father's ultimate dream is to see his son grow up and be
        something good, not a cricketer. When Gaurav fails in school and his
        principal refuses to allow him to sit for Madhyamik, his father asks the
        principal to give him 5 days within which Gaurav would produce the
        desired results. When things remain the same and there is a heated
        argument one day, Subhamoy strikes Gaurav and his head hits the bed and
        he starts bleeding and falls unconscious. He is taken to the hospital
        where he falls in to a coma. He remains like that for a few months
        before he is taken back to his house on the doctor's
        advice.</image:caption
