        >As South Africa celebrates its 20th anniversary of the advent of
        democracy in 1994, it is difficult to believe the ‘Mandela miracle’
        nearly didn’t happen. In an orgy of countrywide violence, some were
        intent on derailing the first free elections. Now, for the first time,
        those responsible for countless deaths and widespread mayhem explain how
        they nearly brought South Africa to its knees. 1994: The Bloody Miracle
        is a chilling look at what these hard men did to thwart democracy, and
        at how they have now made an uneasy peace with the ‘Rainbow Nation’ in
        their own different ways.</image:caption
