        >With a folk singing Janis Joplin, the 13th Floor Elevators, peyote, LSD
        and the first psychedelic music venue in Texas, Austin was a fertile
        ground for the emerging counter culture of the 1960s. Seen as
        nonconformists, Beatnik inspired students were drawn together by folk,
        country and Blues music while dabbling with peyote and later exploring
        with LSD. Traditional values became challenged as they sought a
        lifestyle outside of the system. Civil Rights and the war in Vietnam
        were galvanizing factors in 1960s American society, but the advent of
        psychedelics made it electrified! This is how Austin became
        groovy.</image:caption
