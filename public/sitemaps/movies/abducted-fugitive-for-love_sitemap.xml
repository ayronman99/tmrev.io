        >Jack, a man wrongly convicted of murder is sent to a prison where the
        unscrupulous warden has political aspirations. The warden manipulates
        his wife, his political adviser/lover, the prisoners and the voters, all
        while maintaining a smiling "I'm a great guy" facade. After noticing
        Jack's interest in his neglected wife Melanie, the warden puts Jack into
        a no-win situation in an attempt to make Jack do something Jack doesn't
        want to do. The result has Jack abducting Melanie, followed by the
        police across the state. Then Jack reveals to Melanie the reason why he
        abducted her</image:caption
