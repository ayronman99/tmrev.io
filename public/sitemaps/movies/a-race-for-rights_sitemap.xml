        >This film documents Fiji's constitutional history and provides a
        background to the coup of 17 May 2000 led by George Speight. In 1999
        Fiji had it's first democratically elected Indo-Fijian prime minister,
        Mahendra Chaudhry. There were issues of race, power, religion, loss of
        land, indigenous rights. The coup shook the deeply spiritual country to
        the core and had huge economic and social impacts from which Fiji is
        still recovering.</image:caption
