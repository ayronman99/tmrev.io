        >There has been a grave massacre within a highly successful insurance
        company in Puerto Rico. The owners, a married couple, have been
        slaughtered along with their employees. While the police are
        investigating, a private investigator, Isabelo, is hired. The
        investigation takes place in an underworld of frayed relationships and
        foul connections. It is a detective story that revolves around
        unforeseen secrets dealing in the occult and certain passions that only
        appear to spawn loathing.</image:caption
