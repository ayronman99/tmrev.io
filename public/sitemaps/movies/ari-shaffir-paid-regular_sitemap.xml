        >My debut Comedy Central special, PAID REGULAR, is a tribute to my
        stand-up origins. I shot in the Original Room at the Comedy Store in
        Hollywood. It's where half the great comics for the last 40 years have
        worked out on a nightly basis. It's where I've gone up on stage more
        than anywhere else in the world. To me, this is what comedy is supposed
        to look like. My bits are about me exploring the hackiness of racism,
        life in weed-challenged NYC, and all the ways you too can challenge
        authority. And you also get some of my favorite material that we had to
        cut down for the broadcast edit. The Walking Dead bit was the one that
        hurt the most to have to cut out for TV. And there's a public service
        announcement that you should for sure watch with that special person in
        your life (unless you're both lesbians).</image:caption
