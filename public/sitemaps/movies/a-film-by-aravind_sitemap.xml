        >Aravind (Rajiv Kanakala) and Rishi (Rishi) are childhood buddies. They
        struggled together to come up in life and settle as director and hero
        respectively. They delivered two consecutive hits together and are in
        search of a script for a 3rd film. Of the scripts sent by various story
        writers, Aravind finds one script to be interesting. But that script was
        smudged with ink after 60th page (25th scene). He summons his assistant
        to scout for the writer and takes Rishi for story discussions on that
        script to his remote wooden guesthouse located few kilometers away from
        the city. The scenes mentioned in the script come alive. As the things
        get scary, Aravind wants to see what would happen in the next scene and
        realize that the rest of the script is smudged by ink. The rest of the
        story is all about what happens next.</image:caption
