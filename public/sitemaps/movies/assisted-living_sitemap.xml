        >"Assisted Living" chronicles a day in the life of Todd, a janitor who
        spends his days smoking pot and interacting with the residents for his
        own entertainment. Todd's detachment from his surroundings is
        compromised only by his unlikely friendship with Mrs. Pearlman, a
        resident who begins to confuse him with her son. On this particular day,
        Todd must choose whether or not to play the part. "Assisted Living" is
        shot and staged in a real nursing home and gains much of its unique
        effect and style from the participation of actual residents and staff
        members. During much of the film, it is impossible to distinguish
        between what is real and what is fiction.</image:caption
