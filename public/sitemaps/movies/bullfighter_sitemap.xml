        >Jack is a wanderer whose aimless roaming leads him to a number of
        interesting locations and into the company of many interesting people,
        and despite his fascination with bullfighting he leads a largely
        peaceful existence. When a crime boss' daughter is accidentally gored to
        death, Jack is implicated in the unfortunate event and singled out for
        termination by a seemingly unending army of lethal hitmen. As Jack wages
        an uphill battle for survival against the harsh desert terrain and a
        hail of gun smoke and lead, his will to live depends on his ability to
        exercise his demons and come to terms with the fact that he may not live
        to see another sunrise.</image:caption
