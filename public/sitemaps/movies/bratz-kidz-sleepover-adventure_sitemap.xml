        >When a new girl in the neighborhood, named Ginger, invites Jade, Cloe,
        Sasha, Yasmin and Meagan over to her house for a sleep-over, the girls
        happily accept the invitation to make a new friend. They have fashion
        shows and lots of fun stuff. But before they go to bed they tell scary
        stories. After, the girls try to convince a frightened Ginger to tell
        the last scary story of the night. Ginger is too frightened to tell and
        she runs away. The girls look for her and her parents but there no where
        to be found. The girls find Bats in one of the rooms and run outside.
        Once they are outside they find out its actually an abandon house
        supposedly haunted. Then the monsters that they were talking about in
        the stories come out to life.</image:caption
