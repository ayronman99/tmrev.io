        >King T'Challa returns home to the reclusive, technologically advanced
        African nation of Wakanda to serve as his country's new leader. However,
        T'Challa soon finds that he is challenged for the throne by factions
        within his own country as well as without. Using powers reserved to
        Wakandan kings, T'Challa assumes the Black Panther mantle to join with
        ex-girlfriend Nakia, the queen-mother, his princess-kid sister, members
        of the Dora Milaje (the Wakandan 'special forces') and an American
        secret agent, to prevent Wakanda from being dragged into a world
        war.</image:caption
