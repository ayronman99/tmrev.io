        >The documentary focuses on the creation of The River, a thrilling
        double album that featured Bruce Springsteen concert 1980. Springsteen's
        first top 10 hit “Hungry Heart” along with such classics as “Cadillac
        Ranch,” “Point Blank,” “Out In The Street” and the haunting, cautionary
        title track. It also will include previously unreleased archival footage
        from the River Tour, which raised the singer-songwriter’s profile
        worldwide, and more than 100 recently unearthed photos of Springsteen
        and the E Street Band during the recording sessions. Also featured are
        previously unheard demos and outtakes from the 14-month recording
        process, including such songs as “Stray Bullet,” “Chain Lightning,” “The
        Time That Never Was,” “Cindy” and “Take ‘Em as They
        Come.”</image:caption
