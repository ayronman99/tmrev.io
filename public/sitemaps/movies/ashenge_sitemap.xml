        >On the eve of the Second World War about one hundred fifty Italians
        aircrafts bombarded the northern part of Ethiopia with poisonous gas. On
        March the 6th 1936 the town of Ashenge was shocked by an atrocious mass
        murder which changed the life of Kassa forever. During the Italian
        occupation, the Ethiopian patriots fought to restore peopleâ€™s freedom
        but few Ethiopians collaborated with the enemy, creating seemingly
        insurmountable challenges to the freedom fight. To overcome these years
        of agony, Serke must deal face-to-face with the man responsible for
        heinous killing of both her parents.</image:caption
