        >Samantha "Sam" works at a crisis hot-line where she listens to
        strangers and helps them deal with their pain. It's a pain she knows
        well since the hot-line saved her life once when she lost her sight and
        didn't know how to live in a world of darkness. On her last night on the
        job, Sam receives an terrifying visit from one of her regular callers
        who feels betrayed that she's leaving him. This man is no ordinary
        caller. He's a sadistic serial killer she's unknowingly been keeping
        from killing himself for over a year. With only a skeleton on the
        graveyard shift, there's very little that stands between him and Sam.
        He's come for her and won't let anything or anyone stand in his way.
        Will Sam survive the longest, darkest night of her life?</image:caption
