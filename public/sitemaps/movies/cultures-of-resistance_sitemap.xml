        >In 2003, on the eve of the Iraq war, acclaimed director Iara Lee
        embarked on a journey to better understand a world increasingly
        embroiled in conflict and, as she saw it, heading for self-destruction.
        After several years, traveling over five continents, Iara encountered
        growing numbers of people who committed their lives to promoting change
        through the arts. This is their story. From IRAN, where graffiti and rap
        have become tools in fighting government repression, to BURMA, where
        monks acting in the tradition of Gandhi take on a dictatorship, to
        PALESTINIAN refugee camps in LEBANON, where photography, music, and film
        have given a voice to those rarely heard, CULTURES OF RESISTANCE
        explores how art and creativity can be ammunition in the battle for
        peace and justice.</image:caption
