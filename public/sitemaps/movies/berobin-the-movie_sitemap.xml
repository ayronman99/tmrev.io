        >A documentary about Margaret Cho's homeless outreach campaign inspired
        by the philanthropy of Robin Williams. After the death of her friend
        Robin Williams, Margaret Cho took to the streets of San Francisco with
        the mantra "Don't grieve Robin, BE Robin." What started as Margaret
        busking on the corner with a bag of socks and a guitar case, rapidly
        turned into hundreds of musicians, comedians, and homeless advocates
        spreading food, clothes, money, and awareness in an amazing humanitarian
        street theater experience. The film that captured these events, is not
        only entertaining, but deeply moving and above all else
        inspiring.</image:caption
