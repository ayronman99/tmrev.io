        >"A woman is born to give her body to men; her father or strangers
        should make no difference." Respectable Police Commissioner Josephine
        reinvestigates an insignificant murder case of a 11 years old girl. The
        murderer is the mother of the victim, Becky. Under intense
        interrogation, Becky refused to admit that she knew all along that her
        boyfriend was raping her little daughter at home. The harsh
        interrogation drives Becky into killing herself. What is the truth that
        the raging Commissioner is trying to find out? What is the seemingly
        defenseless mother hiding? Or is she acually telling the truth? Is the
        phrase, "A woman is born to give her body to men." the whole
        truth?</image:caption
