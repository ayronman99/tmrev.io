        >Witness the earth’s greatest wildlife, shot by the world’s greatest
        wildlife cinematographers, in a spectacular 2-hour special originally
        broadcast on National Geographic, Sunday July 9th, 2017. Hosted by
        award-winning actress Jane Lynch and award-winning television
        personality Phil Keoghan, Earth Live gives viewers access to key
        locations across six continents — from South America to Asia and
        everywhere in between — as world-renowned cinematographers use
        cutting-edge technology to showcase a number of wildlife firsts. And,
        for the first time, viewers will watch live wildlife lit only by the
        moon, in full color, via new low-light camera technology.</image:caption
