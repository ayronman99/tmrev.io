        >Siti Zahrana’s academical success makes her parents worried. Zahrana
        hasn’t married by her early thirties. There have been many men who
        solicited her, but she has refused them all politely. Zahrana’s
        conflicting issues spring up: to follow her parents’ wish or to pursue
        her own dreams. Actually she has relented once. She turns down a
        teaching post at Gadjah Mada University. The reason, her parents who
        live in Semarang don’t want her to be away. So Zahrana teaches at a
        Semarang university and stays with them. Then she also passes up a
        doctoral scholarship opportunity from China.</image:caption
