        >The era of the feared sea pirates Klaus Störtebeker and Gödeke Michels
        is coming to an end. After a long period with no booty at last a bulging
        ship appears on the horizon. However, Störtebeker is badly wounded in
        the attempted capture and the pirates suffer ignominious defeat. Not
        only their ship is down the drain - Störtebeker himself is suddenly
        plagued by anxiety and doubt about his very existence as a pirate. He is
        drawn to the beautiful country girl Bille, while Michels gets rebuffed
        by the friesian princess Okka. In the very moment that the crew have
        mutinied and co-captain Michels is literally at the end of his tether,
        they discover on board their ramshackle old tub a most unique wonder
        weapon. Glory days are quickly revived - until the mighty Hanse
        consolidate their power and weaponry and go to war against the pirates.
        Störtebeker and Michels are forced to decide: To live as a farmer or to
        die as a pirate.</image:caption
