        >The story is set in the town of Ranasthali, in year 1989. Bhagat
        Panigrahi (Nara Rohit) is preparing to become a police officer. His
        father Chandrasekhar Panigrahi (Sayaji Shinde), a former Naxalite
        returns after 20 years before giving up his fight for the society for
        the reasons only known to him. He comes back home and questions his
        son's ambition of becoming a Police Officer. Meanwhile a local don,
        Shakti Patnaik (Randhir Gatla) is slowly building his empire,
        terrorizing police and anyone who opposes him. One day, Bhagat meets
        Subbalaxmi (Vedhicka) at the railway station and rescues her from the
        tragedy of her life. When her ex-husband involves Shakti's gang to
        abduct her, it triggers a series of consequences between Bhagat and
        Shakti. The rest is about how Bhagat never gives anything for his
        ambition, which inspires others to stand up for the fight against the
        tyranny of Shakti.</image:caption
