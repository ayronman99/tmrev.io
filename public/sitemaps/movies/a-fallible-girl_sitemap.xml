        >Lifei, decides to set up a mushroom farm in the desert between Dubai
        and Abu Dhabi with her best friend. It's been hard earned cash for these
        2 Chinese girls in working in Dubai, now they are ready to go clean,
        become business women. Life quickly gets tough for the girls, and
        whereas her best friend is quick to return to her former life, Lifei is
        resolute. She has to manage a team of workers from Bangladesh, find
        investors and keep growing and delivering mushrooms throughout Dubai.
        Just as she gets a grip on the matter, and gains some control over her
        life, personal tragedy pushes her to return to China. The only problem
        is she is unable to leave until she pays back the mounting debt she has
        got herself into.</image:caption
