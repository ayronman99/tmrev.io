        >The film is set over the course of a New Year's Eve night in the
        Croatian port city of Split, where it follows three parallel plots. The
        first plot line features a small-time drug dealer Nike (Marinko Prga)
        and a young widow Marija (Nives Ivankovic); the second plot line deals
        with a drug addict called Maja (Marija Skaricic) who decides to have sex
        with an US Navy sailor called Franky (Coolio) in exchange for some
        heroin; the third one shows a young couple, Luka and Andela (Vicko
        Bilandzic and Ivana Roscic) who spend the night desperately looking for
        a place to celebrate the New Year by having their first sexual
        experience. The plots are connected through Dino Dvornik's concert,
        where all of them pass through at some point, and through the
        omnipresent fireworks that dot the night sky over the course of the
        film.</image:caption
