        >Ever judge someone just by looking at them? Of course, we’ve all made
        snap judgments about people. But what if we really got to know them? How
        would our opinions change? And what if we were forced to become them…
        how would the shoes fit then? Stressed-out high school teacher Trish
        Fahey can’t understand her students’ lack of effort and why their
        parents don’t seem to care. This perspective dramatically changes when
        Trish meets Molly, a mysterious stranger intent on helping her see
        things differently. When Trish wrecks her car, Molly is there as Trish
        wakes to find herself living the life of Cindy Kremer, the woman she has
        personally judged and criticized. Trish discovers that there is often
        more to the story and learns a powerful lesson that affects everyone she
        interacts with. Her husband, her daughter, the ex-Marine next door… No
        one is left unchanged.</image:caption
