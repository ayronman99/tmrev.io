        >"Clair de Lune" was fully animated and scored when it was deleted from
        Fantasia in early 1940, a casualty of Fantasia's excessive length. In
        February 1942, inking, painting and technicolor photography were
        completed for "Clair de Lune" as a short subject, but it was not
        released. In 1946 it was edited , reshaped and re-scored as the popular
        music sequence "Blue Bayou" in "Make Mine Music". Previous attempts to
        recreate "Clair de Lune" were frustrated by missing animation and
        Stokowski footage. A nitrate workprint of the original version located
        in 1992 has allowed "Clair de Lune" to be completely reconstructed as
        Walt Disney intended it to be seen.</image:caption
