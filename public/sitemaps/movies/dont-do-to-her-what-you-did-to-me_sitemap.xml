        >"One sees a close-up shot of a glass being filled with water. Bubbles
        are formed but slowly the water regains its still quality. The glass
        then acts as a deformative device between the viewer and the artist, as
        a hand is writing "don't do to her what you did to me" on the back of
        the photographs. Everything is still again for a short while until,
        slowly and majestically, a flush of black ink flows downwards, staining
        the water... The ink preludes the more dramatic fate of the repeated
        haunting images, the deceased woman. One hears a metallic sound as the
        photographs move in a more frenetic spin. One is aware of the glass
        again, of the limited space where a struggle takes place between a
        probable spoon and the photographs which dematerialise under one's eyes.
        The sheer immediacy of the destruction process is intensified as the
        image dissolves into an organic paste. Then, a woman, the artist, drinks
        the solution, the last ironic phase of the talisman."
