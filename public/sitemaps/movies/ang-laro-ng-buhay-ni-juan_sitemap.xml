        >The Game of Juanâ€™s Life explores two hours in the life of Juan Reyes, a
        live-sex performer at an underground gay bar, who has decided to leave
        Manila and go back to his home province. On the day of his departure, he
        will take us with him as he makes life decisions, big and small. The
        most important one of all is leaving the impoverished place he called
        home for the past year, capping it with emotional goodbyes to his lover,
        Noel. Then, he will lead us to the underground bar for his last
        performance, and an event that will cause him to question his
        resolve.</image:caption
