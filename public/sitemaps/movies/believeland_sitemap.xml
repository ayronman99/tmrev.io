        >The Drive. The Fumble. The Shot. The Decision. José Mesa. And so it
        goes for Cleveland sports fans. BELIEVELAND attempts to explain the
        masochistic devotion many Browns, Indians, and Cavs fans have when it
        comes to cheering for teams that continue to break our hearts. Including
        interviews with ghosts of sports heroes past, current Cleveland
        personalities, and many of the very fanatics that keep taking their
        licks, BELIEVELAND is like group therapy where the patients are the ones
        asking “why, Why, WHY!” Only true Clevelanders can understand our love
        for our city, our loyalty to our teams, and the mentality that hungers
        for more even though it’s been 50 years since our last championship. And
        that’s because one day–one day–we’ll be able to say, “I told you so” to
        everyone who refuses to believe.</image:caption
