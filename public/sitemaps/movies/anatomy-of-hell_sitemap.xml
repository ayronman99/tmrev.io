        >A man rescues a woman from a suicide attempt in a gay nightclub.
        Walking the streets together, she propositions him: She'll pay him to
        visit her at her isolated house for four consecutive nights. There he
        will silently watch her. He's reluctant, but agrees. As the four nights
        progress, they become more intimate with each other, and a mutual
        fascination/revulsion develops. By the end of the four-day "contract",
        these two total strangers will have had a profound impact on each
        other.</image:caption
