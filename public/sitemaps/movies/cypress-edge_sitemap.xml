        >Reeling from the news of his sister's suicide, Beau McCammon returns
        home to his family after a long absence. His father, who has just barely
        won another term as senator, doesn't take things well when Beau
        approaches him with the sinking suspicion that the suicide may have
        actually been a murder. Determined to solve the mystery, Beau uncovers a
        plethora of family secrets, deception, and implications of unspeakable
        political wrongdoings.</image:caption
