        >Industry insiders like Stan Lee and Neil Gaiman (The Sandman) reflect
        on the way their colorful creations reflect society at large. They have
        spread from the pulpy pages of nickel comics to Saturday morning
        cartoons, the big screen and beyond. They have evolved from simple,
        All-American heroes to tortured, complicated characters reflecting the
        dreams, desires and fears of modern society. From Superman to The
        Sandman, Comic Book Superheroes Unmasked is a fascinating,
        feature-length look at the evolution of an art form that has proved
        remarkably adaptable and enduring. Filled with classic images from DC
        and Marvel Comics as well as extensive interviews with modern masters of
        the graphic novel like Neil Gaiman and Frank Miller (The Dark Knight
        Returns), this documentary, originally aired on the History Channel,
        goes far beyond the superficial escapist fantasies to probe the forces
        that shaped the characters who have become legend...</image:caption
