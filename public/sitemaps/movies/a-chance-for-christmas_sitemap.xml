        >Social media influencer Christina Chance promotes the perfect family
        image. This year, she has the chance to become the face of lifestyle
        brand, Love Handles, on the condition that her Christmas Eve special
        delivers at least two million engagements. Seems easy enough except
        Christina’s family is far from perfect. When her Love Handles account
        manager, Devon, shows up and discovers Christina’s life is all smoke and
        mirrors, he helps Christina keep up her ruse. With a Christmas wish,
        Christina and Devon are given the chance to relive the day until
        Christina can get the views she needs to win the endorsement. As
        Christina and Devon work together, sparks fly, and they learn the power
        of family is far more important than views.</image:caption
