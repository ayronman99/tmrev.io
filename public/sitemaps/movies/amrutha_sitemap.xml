        >This film deals with an emotional story. Screenplay of the film is
        good, but not tight. Taking of the shots is excellent. Direction is
        extraordinary when is come to the individual scenes. There are three
        scenes in which he leaves his mark strongly on us. One of that is the
        flashback narration to Amrutha after which the entire flashback is shown
        like Simran is reading it from a book. Second scene is the one in which
        the daughter and mother meets in the climax. Third one is Amrutha
        talking to a stranger in Sri Lanka who later on turn out to be a suicide
        bomber who blasts himself by jumping on to an army convoy. But Mani
        Ratnam should have considered inserting commercial elements to make it a
        movie more commercially viable.</image:caption
