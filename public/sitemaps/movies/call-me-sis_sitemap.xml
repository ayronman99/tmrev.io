        >Mi-ae, a middle aged woman is facing a midlife crisis not unlike those
        shared by countless others. A mother of three, the wife of a relatively
        prosperous bank executive, and a woman who enjoys a comfortably
        middle-class existence, Mi-ae grows increasingly frustrated by her two
        sons’ demeaning behavior towards her, her boorish husband’s unforgivable
        cheapness, and her own sadness at never having felt for herself the joys
        of true love — something she becomes acutely aware of when observing her
        estranged daughter’s loving relationship with another woman. After
        abruptly leaving a disastrous anniversary evening arranged by her
        thoughtless husband, Mi-ae meets the shy and kind Soo-nim, her youngest
        son’s schoolmate. Choosing to spend a long evening with Soo-nim rather
        than return home to the male members of her family, Mi-ae finds herself
        irresistibly drawn to this gentle young woman as a flood of emotions
        sweeps Mi-ae away on an unexpected journey of
        self-discovery.</image:caption
