        >A reflection on the deep and the creatures that attempt to fathom its
        resources (such as baked salmon and rubbery crocodile meat). A visual
        journey into the far reaches of waterlogged consciousness, where the
        yearnings of the tummy meet the revulsion of the craniumâ€”a cranium
        mostly made up of water in the first place, like a head of cabbage.
        Besides, the video is more of a head-trip to the nether reaches of
        Neptune's haunts where tourists glide through guts of glass to ooh and
        aah at the mysteries of the deep-end. Taped in Frisco, Baltimore, and
        Pacifica, let the salt air of this far-flung journey corrode the
        land-lubber blubber that beaches you upon the sands of sanity and render
        your sails impotent to the blows of the tradewind. Cast ahoy that anchor
        of dead meat between your thighs and let it plunge into the deep wetness
        from which we all ascended.</image:caption
