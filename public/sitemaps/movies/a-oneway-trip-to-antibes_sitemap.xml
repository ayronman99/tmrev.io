        >When George (Sven-Bertil Taube), a half-blind widower, learns that his
        children (Malin Morgan, Dan Ekborg) have conceived an elaborate plan to
        get their hands on his assets before he dies, he must confront his life
        choices. After catching his young home help Maria (Rebecca Ferguson's
        screen debut) red-handed in the act of stealing, George blackmails her
        into assisting him in a counterattack, triggering off a chain reaction
        in the family. George's children discover that he has a secret mistress
        in France.</image:caption
