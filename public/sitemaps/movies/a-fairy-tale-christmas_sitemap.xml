        >Once upon a time there was a happy kingdom at the crest of a broad
        river, at the edge of nearly endless forest. The kingdom was ruled by a
        fair and just King who had but one daughter, who was the apple of his
        eye: Princess Angela. She thought of herself as the happiest girl in the
        whole world because she played all day and danced for her father, the
        King, at night. But one day all happiness in the kingdom came to an end.
        Princess Angela was kidnapped by the King's Viceroy. The Viceroy left
        Angela with his brother, a selfish and mean-hearted woodsman, who lived
        deep in the heart of the nearly endless forest. Years passed and the
        kingdom became a very unhappy place, for the King spent all his time
        looking searching from one end of his vast kingdom to the other looking
        for his daughter, Princess Angela.</image:caption
