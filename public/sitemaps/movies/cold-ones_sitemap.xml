        >Every stranger has a secret in writer-director Garrett Clancy’s indie
        drama, also released as Dead Letters. Ten years after his first novel
        went down in flames, the hard knocks just won’t stop for K.C. Corcoran
        (C. Thomas Howell) - his girlfriend’s just thrown him out. K.C. hopes to
        get his life back on track by writing another book and heads to a remote
        mountain cabin to work on it … but the locals prove more hazardous than
        he could have guessed.</image:caption
