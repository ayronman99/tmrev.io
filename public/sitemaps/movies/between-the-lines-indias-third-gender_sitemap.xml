        >Repping best view to date into the world of the Indian eunuch, “Between
        the Lines: India’s Third Gender” may not answer all the questions it
        poses, but helmer Thomas Wartmann provides an intimate glimpse at a
        community whose members are considered pariahs and conduits of
        supernatural force. Following shutterbug Anita Khemka in her quest to
        discover why these castrated men fascinate and repel, docu concentrates
        on three personalities and uses them as guides to their highly
        stratified world. Under its nautch skirts, film has strong enough legs
        to step out into international arthouses.</image:caption
