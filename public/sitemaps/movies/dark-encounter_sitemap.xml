        >A year after the mysterious disappearance of an 8 year-old girl, we
        meet her grieving family as they return home from her memorial service
        in their small town. Later that evening, strange lights appear in the
        nearby forest and the family is exposed to an inexplicably strange
        phenomenon that rattles them to the core. The origin of the lights
        appear to be visitors from another world that seemingly terrorize the
        family. What they don't realize is that these 'beings' will lead the
        family to the truth behind the little girl's disturbing
        disappearance.</image:caption
