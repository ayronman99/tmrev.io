        >In this feature-length film combining footage from classic Warner
        Brothers cartoon shorts with newly animated bridging sequences, Daffy
        Duck, after having induced laughter in an ailing millionaire and
        forestalled the millionaire's death for a time (as chronicled in Daffy
        Dilly (1948), is the beneficiary for the deceased millionaire's assets.
        But the millionaire's will clearly stipulates that Daffy must use the
        money for the common good, by providing a service, and should Daffy
        think of pursuing selfish aims, the millionaire's ghost will "repossess"
        his millions by making them disappear from Earthly existence. Under the
        pretense of community service, Daffy opens an exorcism agency and
        employs Porky Pig, Sylvester Cat, and Bugs Bunny to track and eliminate
        ghosts, ghouls, and other monsters, while Daffy secretly schemes to use
        his learned "ghost-busting" talents to rid himself of the millionaire's
        nagging spirit.</image:caption
