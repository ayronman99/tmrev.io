        >A young fashion blogger and an aspiring songwriter seem to have not
        that much in common, but when Cupidâ€™s arrow hits them, every difference
        fades away and overnight they decide to get married. Even their fathers
        do not have anything in common: Gaetano is a strict mayor from Southern
        Italy, while Diego is a rich entrepreneur from the North. Between the
        two forthcoming in-laws, instead, is hate at first sight. They seem to
        agree on one single common goal: prevent this marriage at any cost!
        After fighting by any means in a struggle that will also involve their
        two bizarre families, will they manage to say no to the
        wedding?</image:caption
