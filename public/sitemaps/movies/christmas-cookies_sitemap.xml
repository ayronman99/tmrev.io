        >Aunt Sally's Christmas Cookie Company is sold to a large conglomerate
        and executive Hannah must seal the deal and shut down the factory, which
        is the small town of Cookie Jar's lifeblood. What was supposed to be a
        simple assignment for Hannah becomes complicated when she meets Jake,
        the factory owner who's determined to keep the factory in town. Despite
        not being a fan of the holiday, the Christmas spirit in this small town
        is infectious and she gets swept up in the joy of the season while also
        falling in love with Jake.</image:caption
