        >The life of Bill "Bojangles" Robinson, African-American tap-dancing
        star of stage and screen. In 1916, Robinson was a successful vaudeville
        performer and considered the finest tap dancer of his generation. At the
        peak of his career, he was the highest paid Black entertainer, but for
        all the joy he gave others, his life was anything but happy, there was a
        great deal of tragedy in himself. He died broke and
        penniless.</image:caption
