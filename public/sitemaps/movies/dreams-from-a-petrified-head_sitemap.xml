        >Amanda Sage was a dissident whose beliefs and ideas retain the power to
        disturb a long established mode of living. A restless public is
        re-awakening long after her death fueled by the recordings of her
        anti-government speeches. Jeremy's new job entails rewriting her words
        and her visual image; nullifying and softening the impact of her
        heartfelt rhetoric. While working to comprehend her lectures, to
        effectively alter them, he chooses a taboo course of action; he dumps
        her stored memory into an android body made in her likeness. This brings
        him dangerously close to her and her message.</image:caption
