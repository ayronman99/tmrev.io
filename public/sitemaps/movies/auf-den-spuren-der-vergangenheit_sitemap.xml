        >Many years ago Thaddeus Hartington quarreled with his son David. Now he
        is seriously ill, but only wants to undergo a risky heart surgery, if he
        had the opportunity to reconcile with David. His dedicated doctor Kate
        sets out to find the missing person. She finds him in a small south
        English town, where he lives with his son Jeffrey. With charm and
        openness, Kate manages to win David's trust and eventually his heart.
        However, when he learns that Kate is on his father's behalf, this puts
        the young love to the test.</image:caption
