        >Karan (Bobby Deol) was wealthy and a mansion was his habitat. Raj
        (Akshay Kumar) had empty pockets and the sky was his roof. Karan's jet
        ensured that he could fly if he wanted. Raj could only depend on his two
        feet. Karan had a family and yet craved love. Raj had love to share, but
        craved a family. Karan was the eternal Casanova. Raj was the proverbial
        one-woman man. Karan had it all, and yet felt empty. Raj had nothing,
        but his heart was full. They were two people as different as can be. Yet
        they found a common ground. One that led to the glorious road of
        Friendship! But can they sustain their friendship when new conflicts
        arise?</image:caption
