        >Eccentric and full of manias, Michele is a young high school professor
        who defines himself as “not used to happiness”. He realizes his life is
        meaningless if he doesn’t have a woman by his side but, after a series
        of rather disastrous experiences, he feels more alone than ever. Then,
        out of the blue, a new French teacher called Bianca arrives at school.
        Amongst uncertainties and contradictions, the two start dating. In the
        meantime, a series of homicides take place and a police officer begins
        to suspect that Michele is involved. Bianca will save him providing an
        alibi at the right moment, but then, everything goes wrong
        again.</image:caption
