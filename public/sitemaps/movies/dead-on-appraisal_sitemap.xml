        >Real estate agent John Dante has a problem. He's stuck with a house he
        can't sell. Despite his best efforts, he can't seem to overcome the
        house's past and the macabre tales that precede it in this haunting
        anthology. In the first story, THE MORNING AFTER, a group of friends
        wake up from the party of a lifetime to find a nightmare in the form of
        the worst bug invasion any homeowner has ever seen. Then there's Freddie
        Cooper and his band, FREDDIE AND THE GOBLINS; a tale of how Freddie's
        band mates try to kick him out and get caught up in the young singer's
        growing psychosis. With his hopes of selling the house fading, John is
        horrified to hear the story of Robbie, a young veteran of the war in
        Iraq, who returns home to live with his father Brad in FATHER LAND.
        Something isn't right, though, as Robbie's dark secret slowly bubbles to
        the surface. As the house's dark past comes to life, John becomes weary
        and is convinced the house is cursed and unsellable.</image:caption
