        >Five years in the making, with a cast of thousands, Destroying America
        comes on the heels of the best selling skateboard video of all time, The
        End. A film this dangerous hasn't been seen since Cannonball Run 2.
        Heath Kirchart and Jeremy Klein are two skateboarders just out to have a
        good time in a race across the good old US of A. Rescued after a near
        death skateboarding accident, the two show off their amazing ability to
        cause destruction while a sinister cop, with an agenda of his own, tires
        to bring them down. The top notch story, an all-star cast (Eric Estrada,
        Tony Hawk, Ming Tran), and a special guest appearance by the Hook-Ups
        Destruction Van, makes Destroying America this year's hottest
        movie.</image:caption
