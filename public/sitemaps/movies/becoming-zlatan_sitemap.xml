        >The decisive years of Swedish soccer player Zlatan Ibrahimović, told
        through rare archive footage in which a young Zlatan speaks openly about
        his life and challenges. The film closely follows him, from his debut
        with the Malmö FF team in 1999 through his conflict-ridden years with
        Ajax Amsterdam, and up to his final breakthrough with Juventus in
        2005.</image:caption
