        >16 years old Shlomi lives with his restless mother, his soldier brother
        and their ill grandfather. Although not doing well in school, Shlomi is
        a gifted cook and takes care of most household chores. One day, the
        school's principal finds out Shlomi is actually a genius and tries to
        get him into a more suitable curriculum. However, Shlomi is more
        interested in taking care of his family and his new love interest, the
        beautiful girl next door.</image:caption
