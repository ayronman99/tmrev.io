        >Until now, Zak Gibbs' greatest challenge has been to find a way to buy
        a car. But when he discovers an odd wristwatch amidst his father's
        various inventions and slips it on -- something very strange happens.
        The world around him seems to come to a stop, everything and everybody
        frozen in time. Zak quickly learns how to manipulate the device and he
        and his quick-witted and beautiful new friend, Francesca, start to have
        some real fun.</image:caption
