        >One day, Eduardo arrives at his house and discovers that Julia, his
        wife, tried to commit suicide. She left her husband and two children
        without saying goodbye. After some time, she comes back home. He tries
        everything to set her straight, but the impossibility of knowing her
        fully grieves him. The shadow of the suicide and the inevitable ghost of
        a new chance hover over their heads. Eduardo insists on understanding
        his wife, but an increasing jealousy and an unexpected discovery of her
        past torture him. He does not realize that, most of the time, the search
        for control easily becomes an obsession.</image:caption
