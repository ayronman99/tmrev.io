        >Thoughtfully, lovingly, Aurora tells the story of an unwanted
        pregnancy. Alongside her work as an architect, 40-year-old Luisa gives
        inspirational creative workshops to children. One day, she comes across
        17-year-old Julia by the school toilets; it turns out she has
        unintentionally become pregnant. Luisa decides to help her â€“ in the
        process manoeuvring herself into a difficult position somewhere between
        friend, teacher and mother figure. Or does she secretly enjoy playing
        this role?</image:caption
