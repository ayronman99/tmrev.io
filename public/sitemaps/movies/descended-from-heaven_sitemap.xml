        >The late Pericles gets permission from God to return to earth and help
        his family, who has gone astray after his death. Invisible to all but
        present everywhere, he is able to eavesdrop on what's going on: his
        youngest daughter lives it up with some Teddy boys, his eldest do not

        gambler.</image:caption
