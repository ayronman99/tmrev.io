        >Trapped in her own doll-like existence, Faith dreams that one day she
        can be a real mother to her daughter Nell she abandoned seven years ago.
        But time has run out. Her sister Eris can no longer keep the child. Her
        boyfriend Mance won't play father to a rape child. The girl is to be
        adopted. Desperate to save her dream, Faith takes her daughter into her
        dollhouse fantasy world, where bad things never happen. But she can't
        keep reality out. Nell wants a real mother. Mance thinks she's going
        mad. Eris thinks it's all an act. As the dollhouse reveals itself as
        thin veil covering the terrors of her past, Faith has to face her pain
        or be condemned to a life of shame.</image:caption
