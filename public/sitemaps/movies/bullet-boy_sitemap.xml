        >Ricky is just out of a young offenders institute, heading home to
        Hackney and determined to go straight. Instead, he heads straight for
        trouble when he becomes involved in a street confrontation, siding with
        his best friend Wisdom against a local rude boy. The trouble escalates
        into a series of tit-for-tat incidents that threaten to spiral out of
        control. Ricky's 12-year-old brother Curtis, hero-worships Ricky, though
        he appears smart enough to know he doesn't want to follow his example.
        Yet, despite the stern warnings from his mother and support from her
        friends in the community, might Ricky's bad boy allure be too attractive
        for Curtis to resist?</image:caption
