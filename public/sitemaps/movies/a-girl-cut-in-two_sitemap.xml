        >Gabrielle Deneige is an independent, ambitious TV weather girl torn
        between her love of a distinguished author several decades her senior,
        and the attentions of a headstrong, potentially unstable young suitor.
        An unspoken past between the two men heightens tensions, and though
        she's initially certain of her love for one them, the see-saw demands
        and whims of both men keep confusing - and darkening - matters. Before
        long she's encountering emotional and societal forces well beyond her
        control, inexorably leading to a shocking clash of violence and
        passion.</image:caption
