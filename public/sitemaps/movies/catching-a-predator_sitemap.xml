        >With exclusive access to Greater Manchester Police's 2017-19
        investigation, this is the story of serial male rapist Reynhard Sinaga’s
        conviction – the biggest rape case in British legal history. From his
        flat in Manchester, mature student Sinaga would target lone men who’d
        been on a night out and invite them into his home. Once they were
        inside, he would drug, assault and rape them. As evidence of the
        horrific scale of Sinaga's offending was uncovered, the film tells the
        detailed inside story of how detectives pieced together an unprecedented
        prosecution.</image:caption
