        >14 Video Paintings is comprised of two separate works ("Mistaken
        Memories of Mediaeval Manhattan" and "Thursday Afternoon") created in
        the early 80s by Brian Eno for art gallery exhibition only. Viewers are
        presented with a series of slowly evolving "video paintings," with
        "Thursday Afternoon" focusing on the human figure and "Mistaken
        Memories" on the Manhattan skyline. The music for "Thursday Afternoon"
        is a different version than what appears on Eno's album of the same
        name, while the music that accompanies "Mistaken Memories" comes from
        two of his acclaimed ambient albums (On Land and Music For Airports) and
        features an unreleased track.</image:caption
