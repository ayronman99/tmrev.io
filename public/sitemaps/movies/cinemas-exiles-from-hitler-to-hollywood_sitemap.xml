        >Eight hundred German filmmakers (cast and crew) fled the Nazis in the
        1930s. The film uses voice-overs, archival footage, and film clips to
        examine Berlin's vital filmmaking in the 1920s; then it follows a
        producer, directors, composers, editors, writers, and actors to
        Hollywood: some succeeded and many found no work. Among those profiled
        are Erich Pommer, Joseph May, Ernst Lubitsch, Fritz Lang, Billy Wilder,
        and Peter Lorre. Once in Hollywood, these exiles helped each other,
        housed new arrivals, and raised money so others could escape. Some
        worked on anti-Nazi films, like Casablanca. The themes and lighting of
        German Expressionism gave rise in Hollywood to film noir.</image:caption
