        >Van Vlahakis left Greece five decades ago with 22 dollars in his
        pocket. He arrived in the US hoping for a better future for him and his
        family. Eftichios as is his Greek name not only managed to live the
        American dream for himself, but also created Earth Friendly Products, a
        US giant for environmentally friendly cleaning products. His story is
        not only about transforming his life but also the lives of the ones
        around him as the owner and CEO of Earth Friendly Products. The story
        centers on the modern day Vlahakis, who is diagnosed with cancer and
        given only few months to live. During this time, he reflects on his
        early life as an immigrant during the 1950's and ultimately decides to
        push himself to the limit by closing one final business deal that will
        concretize his company's success, even if it means taking on a large
        corporation that is trying to take over his company.</image:caption
