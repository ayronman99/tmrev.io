        >There is no single truth in love. Each treads their own path. Which
        should take precedence â€“ passion or duty? How do we choose? And who gets
        to judge? These are the eternal questions, remorselessly thrust upon us
        by life. Anna Karenina made her choice, leaving her son Sergei to grow
        up struggling to understand why his mother took such a tragic and
        terrible path, and Count Vronsky haunted by the memory of the woman for
        whose death he still blames himself 30 years later. In 1904, in the
        aftermath of one of the battles of the Russo-Japanese war, Sergei
        Karenin and Alexei Vronsky find themselves thrown together in a remote
        Manchurian village, where fate offers them a chance to return to the
        events long past and, finally, to find the answers both have long been
        seeking.</image:caption
