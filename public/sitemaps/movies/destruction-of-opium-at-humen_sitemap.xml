        >At the end of the Qing Dynasty, opium was packaged by British merchants
        as "Fu Shou Ointment" and sold to China, and countless people suffered
        greatly. Cigarette restaurants in Guangzhou are blooming everywhere,
        smokers flock to them, sinking corpses at the bottom of the river,
        selling children for cigarettes are common, and countless families are
        broken and people die. Lin Zexu (Yao Yao), the Minister of the Imperial
        Household, is ordered to go south to sell cigarettes, but he is
        subjected to repeated reprisals for his involvement in the black chain
        of government and business interests behind opium, assassins and human
        bombs</image:caption
