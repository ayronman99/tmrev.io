        >Bruno Salvati is a director of little success, fresh from the
        separation from his wife Anna with whom he had two children, the
        twenty-year-old Adele and the seventeen-year-old Tito. Following a
        sudden illness, Bruno is diagnosed with a disease that requires the
        intervention of a donor. All his family relationships are called into
        question, including that with his father Umberto, the custodian of a
        secret that will force Bruno to embark on a journey in search of someone
        who can help him.</image:caption
