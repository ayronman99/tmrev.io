        >Robbie, a divorced Amsterdam commoner, is meanly denied access to his
        son Tommi, except for monthly visitation. He grudgingly accepts when a
        loan shark offers to scrap his debt and throw in some cash for a simple
        service. Robbie must simply trick Marius, a man he never knew, to the
        port for a fictitious job. As he gets to know Marius, he starts feeling
        for the generous sociable type. His conscience wants him to warn the
        mark he's likely to be beaten up.</image:caption
