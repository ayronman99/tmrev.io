        >Nothing equals that feeling of ultimate conquest like our first sexual
        experiences. It is a time of mystery, wonder and new adult
        responsibilities. Here are real-life stories of young men taking the
        final step on their journey from boyhood to manhood. Superb photography,
        spectacular guys and candid interviews capture the joys and fears of
        sexual awakening and evoke memories of those early experiences that
        define our lives. Tony Award winning Broadway and film star, Alan
        Cumming, narrates this sensitive look at the challenges and glories of
        youthful passion, including current information for making safer
        choices. A must for all men.</image:caption
