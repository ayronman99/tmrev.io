        >Mike Bartlett's play Albion, directed for the stage by Rupert Goold, is
        a tragicomic drama about national identity, family, passion and the
        disappointment of personal dreams. Filmed at Londonâ€™s Almeida Theatre,
        the play is set in the garden of an English country house. The house has
        been bought by successful businesswoman Audrey Walters, who intends to
        restore the ruined garden to its former glory and create a memorial to
        the son she recently lost in a foreign war.</image:caption
