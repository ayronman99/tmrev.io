        >Meg, a music manager, travels from New York to London to manage a boy
        band, Five Together, and find them a Christmas number one to bolster
        their flagging career. She finds a song on the internet posted by an
        ailing thirteen-year-old girl, Nina, and tries to obtain permission to
        have the song re-recorded by Five Together, but she discovers she has
        competition from the songwriter, Nina’s uncle Blake. What follows is a
        romantic comedy about two worlds colliding – with a young woman at the
        centre who desperately wants her uncle to find love and for his song to
        hit the number one spot by Christmas Day.</image:caption
