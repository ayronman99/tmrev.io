        >The wealthy businessman Vincenzo realizes that he is a father too
        absent, but also that his two sons and 1aughter are spoiled and unable
        to support themselves economically. So Vincenzo stages their fraudulent
        bankruptcy and runs with their children in Taranto, in his old house.
        The boys are struggling to settle, but Vincenzo is confident about them
        and hope that they will soon find a job in the city. Meanwhile, an
        impostor blackmailer, who wants to marry the daughter of Vincenzo,
        arrives in Puglia, to expose the scam.</image:caption
