        >Disney Channel's production of Julie Sherman Wolfe's screenplay
        adaptation of the popular novel Avalon High by Meg Cabot. Elaine "Ellie"
        Harrison has just moved from Minnesota to Annapolis, Maryland while her
        parents take a year long sabbatical to continue their medieval studies
        in nearby DC. Her new high school, Avalon High, seems like a typical
        high school with the stereotypical students: Lance the jock, Jennifer
        the cheerleader, Marco, the bad boy/desperado, and Will, the senior
        class president, quarterback, and all around good guy. But not everyone
        at Avalon High is who they appear to be, not even Ellie herself.
        Eventually, it becomes apparent that Avalon High is a situation where
        the ancient Arthurian legend is repeating itself. Will, Jennifer, Lance,
        Marco, and Mr. Morton all correspond to King Arthur, Queen Guinevere,
        Knight Lancelot, Mordred, and Merlin, respectively.</image:caption
