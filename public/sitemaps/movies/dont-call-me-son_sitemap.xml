        >Pierre is seventeen and in the middle of puberty. He plays in a band,
        has sex at parties and secretly tries on women’s clothing and lipstick
        in front of a mirror. Ever since his father’s death, his mother Aracy
        has looked after him and his younger sister Jacqueline, spoiling them
        both. But when he discovers that she stole him from a hospital when he
        was a new born baby, Pierre’s life changes dramatically. In her new
        film, director Anna Muylaert explores the mother-child relationship
        through the eyes of a rebellious son whose whole world unravels
        overnight.</image:caption
