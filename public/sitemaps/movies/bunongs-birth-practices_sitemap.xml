        >On the basis of a social anthropological case study, this film
        documents the birth practices of the Bunong in Mondulkiri province,
        located in the northeast of Cambodia. Social, economic, and political
        changes are transforming the province tremendously and are affecting
        villagers' beliefs, perceptions and habits regarding pregnancy, delivery
        and early motherhood. Traditional midwives, pregnant women, mothers and
        their families give a personal insight into their present
        decision-making strategies, which are at the crossroads between
        tradition and modernity.</image:caption
