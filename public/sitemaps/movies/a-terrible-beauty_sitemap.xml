        >A Terrible Beauty is the story of the men and women of the Easter
        Rising in Dublin in 1916, Irish and British, caught up in a conflict
        many did not understand and of the innocent men and boys, executed
        because of what transpired in The Battle of Mount Street Bridge. The
        British soldiers were the last of the Great War volunteers, who joined
        up together to fight the Germans. They knew that there was a strong
        chance they would die in France, but to die in Dublin would never have
        crossed their minds. The Irish Volunteers were weekend warriors many of
        whom had no idea they were about to take part in large scale battles on
        the streets of Dublin.</image:caption
