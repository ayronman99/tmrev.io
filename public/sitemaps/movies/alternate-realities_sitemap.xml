        >John Rotit is a happy, content man with a loving wife. Hours later,
        he's a rock star shooting up heroin. And after that...he's something far
        more sinister. John unwillingly flashes between three parallel lives in
        which he knowingly exists in each. He has no clue how or why this
        phenomenon is occurring, only that he wants it to stop. John's judgment
        becomes clouded as he'll do anything he can to end his flashes and
        remain in the one life where he's truly happy.</image:caption
