        >On December 12, 1863, General Ambrose Burnside's Army of the Potomac
        engaged General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia in the town of
        Fredericksburg, Virginia... Close combat through the streets of
        Fredericksburg and multiple assaults on the Confederate army entrenched
        in the heights behind the town resulted in heavy Federal casualties,
        which forced an eventual withdrawal. In November, 2001, I attended a
        small and relatively informal reenactment of the battle of
        Fredericksburg. About a hundred men and women did their best to
        illustrate the actions of the thousands of young men who offered their
        lives a century earlier. An air of absurd theater suffused the entire
        event, which provided the ground for its peculiar truth. Everyone played
        their part exceedingly honestly and well, and left something on the film
        I was myself surprised to find there.</image:caption
