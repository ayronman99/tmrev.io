        >Fear, anger, sadness, joy, disgust, envy, shame. Adaś Miauczyński goes
        back to his childhood days when, like most of us, he used to find it
        problematic to name the emotions that accompanied him. To improve the
        quality of his adult life, he decides to return to that time – which
        proves not so carefree after all – to learn how to experience the seven
        basic emotions. This extremely unpredictable journey into the past
        features an abundance of hilarious, even comical, situations but is also
        filled with lots of touching moments and food for
        thought.</image:caption
