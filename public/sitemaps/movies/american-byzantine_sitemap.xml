        >American Byzantine follows the creation of a remarkable new work of
        art, the 38-ton marble relief, The Universal Call to Holiness. Designed
        by American artist George Carr and carved in Italy, the work now adorns
        the rear wall of the largest Catholic church in the western hemisphere,
        the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in
        Washington, DC. The Shrine is a uniquely American church that combines
        both the art and architecture reminiscent of ancient Byzantium with more
        than 60 smaller ethnic chapels that honor the faith of millions of
        American immigrants. American Byzantine tells the story of the building
        of the Shrine and its connection to America in the 20th century. It also
        gives the viewer a glimpse of the inspiration for the Shrine, a few of
        them the mysteries of Byzantium: Istanbul's Hagia Sophia and the
        astonishing mosaics of Ravenna, Italy. Produced and narrated by Martin
        Doblmeier Co-produced by Kristin Fellows.</image:caption
