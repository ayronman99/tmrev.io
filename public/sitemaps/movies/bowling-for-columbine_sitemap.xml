        >This is not a film about gun control. It is a film about the fearful
        heart and soul of the United States, and the 280 million Americans lucky
        enough to have the right to a constitutionally protected Uzi. From a
        look at the Columbine High School security camera tapes to the home of
        Oscar-winning NRA President Charlton Heston, from a young man who makes
        homemade napalm with The Anarchist's Cookbook to the murder of a
        six-year-old girl by another six-year-old. Bowling for Columbine is a
        journey through the US, through our past, hoping to discover why our
        pursuit of happiness is so riddled with violence.</image:caption
