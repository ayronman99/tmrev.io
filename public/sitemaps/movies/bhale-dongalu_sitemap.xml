        >Remake of Hindi Hit Bunty Aur Babli. The story begins when Ramu, having
        ditched yet another job interview, coming home to his angry father. His
        father berates him, and in the process, Ramu reveals that he does not
        want an "Udyogam", rather, he want to do "vyapaaram" (he wants to do
        business rather than have a job). After his father vehemently rejects
        the idea, he runs away from home at night. On the other hand, Jyothi
        wants to be a model, and make her big debut in a beauty pageant in the
        city. She tells this to her mother and father, but her grandmother, the
        head of the house says a strong no, and she has already fixed for a
        potential suitor to Jyothi to come to the house the next day. Jyothi
        refuses, but her grandmother ignores her, and her parents are helpless.
        In order to make her dream come true, she runs away at night, and boards
        a train, the same one Ramu happens to be on and together, they begin
        their lives of crime.</image:caption
