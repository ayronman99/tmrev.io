        >Eat This New York is the story of two best friends' struggle to open a
        restaurant in the food capital of the world. As Billy Phelps and John
        McCormick suffer through financial crisis, the loss of their chef, and a
        crumbling relationship, the filmmakers turn the camera on New York
        City's legendary restaurateurs who prove that dreams can come true.
        Billy and John's gamble to open a restaurant together takes shape on
        Division Street, a unique block in Brooklyn that separates the Satmar
        Jewish community of Williamsburg from the Latino neighborhood of the
        South Side. During the course of a year, they convert a former
        check-cashing shop located under the elevated train tracks of the J/M/Z
        subway lines into a retro speakeasy. But before the restaurant is fully
        built they come close to bankruptcy and almost call it quits on their
        friendship.</image:caption
