        >An independent-minded American tour guide is fired from her job in Rome
        just before Christmas. She crosses paths with an American executive
        named Oliver, who wants to buy a high-end Italian ceramics company.
        Oliver hires Angela to be his tour guide around the Eternal City, as the
        owner of the ceramics company won’t sell it to him until he learns “the
        heart and soul of Rome.” But is there another heart and soul that he may
        win?</image:caption
