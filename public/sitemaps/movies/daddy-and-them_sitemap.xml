        >Ruby and her husband Claude are a working-class couple who live in
        suburban Arkansas. As crazy as they are for each other, their
        relationship is far from harmonious. (The lack of money doesn't help
        matters, either.) In fact, their whole family is fraught with unresolved
        conflicts. Then Claude's uncle is arrested on a felony charge, and
        everyone rallies round. Ruby's mother Jewel and flirtatious sister Rose
        (Claude's ex-girlfriend) even fly in from Tennessee; but, far from being
        a source of support, Jewel seems only to want to break up Ruby and
        Claude.</image:caption
