        >Highly cinematic documentary charting a macabre mystery that unfolds as
        the lives of a handful of starkly different, seemingly unconnected
        characters are intimately drawn together by a shocking crime involving
        over a thousand mutilated corpses in a tale of twenty-first century body
        snatching in the city of New York. Much was written about this notorious
        crime but little understood about the hidden, yet legal, tissue
        transplant industry that spawned it...until now. With exclusive access
        inside maximum-security prison to the man the NYPD labeled "Public Enemy
        No.1" this film charts how a former surgeon went from saving lives to
        ripping them apart.</image:caption
