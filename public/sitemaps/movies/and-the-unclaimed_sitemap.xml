        >…and the unclaimed delves into the aftermath of Swapna and Shucheta’s
        deaths, as well as the social conditions that led to their choice. “The
        unclaimed” refers both to the fact that neither of their families came
        forward to claim their bodies, but also to the tenuous state of
        existence of queer and trans folks in India. Interviews with Swapna and
        Shucheta’s families and neighbours are interspersed with the stories of
        ordinary Indian queer and trans people, as well as activists and
        advocates, all of whom are dealing with their own experiences of the
        label “unclaimed”, while fiercely fighting for their rights to live and
        love.</image:caption
