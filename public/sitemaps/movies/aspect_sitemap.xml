        >Across the surface of the forest, light, colour, shadow shift;
        rhythmic, kaleidoscopic. Matter and the immaterial in constant
        counteraction. The screen becomes a painting in animation. Ordinarily,
        light describes the motif. Here, the forest is almost – almost –
        occluded as the light that delineates the world becomes autonomous,
        visible; describes itself as subject. There are some very strange
        effects: light and shadow grow, die back; bark shimmers; branches
        tremble, or clouds pass above; trees shiver in the cold, or shake in
        threatening gesture; sunlight flickers, on and off, like an electric
        bulb. The portrait lives. These films are not the index of space and
        objects, but a cinema of time, movement, light; flickering lashes of
        mesmerised eyes in the click of an aperture.</image:caption
