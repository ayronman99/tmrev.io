        >Mauro Hernandez, a young preventive policeman, gets involved in a coke
        deal, and to keep some of the money he has for paying for the
        transaction, gives his gun away to cover the deal. He argues to Joaquin,
        old drug dealer and ex-policeman and ends up threatening him. On his way
        out of the operation, Mauro and his partner policemen, a gang controlled
        by Joaquin, stop their way out start a wrangle where Mauro is wounded.
        His body armor couldnÂ´t even stop a small touch of the knife. The
        scandal on the bad quality of body armors turns into an investigation of
        malversation of police funds which is exaggerated and misreported by the
        media. Apparently made in 2009, but not released until
        2011.</image:caption
