        >'After doing a re-make of John Cassevetes’ "Faces" [1968], I decided to
        re-make another American classic, Dennis Hopper’s "Easy Rider" [1969].
        "Easy Rider" interests me in two ways: its portrayal of 60’s
        counterculture – unlike "Faces" which for me is more about the 50’s –
        and its search for place. I divided the original film into scenes (like
        I did with "Faces") and then replaced each scene with one shot filmed at
        the original location (unlike "Faces" where shots were gleaned from the
        original film itself). My "Easy Rider" tries to find today’s
        counter-culture (if one exists) by replacing the 60’s music with music
        that I listen to today.' ~ James Benning</image:caption
