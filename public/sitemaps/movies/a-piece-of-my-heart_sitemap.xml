        >Isabella (35) is a driven business woman in Stockholm’s finance world.
        When she goes home to the small town she grew up in to celebrate her
        father’s sixtieth birthday, she feels like a winner, the only one in her
        old school gang that things have really gone well for. Isabella’s
        selfconfidence falters when she realizes that Simon, her great love from
        her teen years, is going to marry Isabella’s childhood friend Molly, and
        that she isn’t invited to the wedding. Isabella is accustomed to getting
        what she wants, and it disturbs her to see Simon so happy with someone
        else. Unfortunately, there are some feelings that never go
        away.</image:caption
