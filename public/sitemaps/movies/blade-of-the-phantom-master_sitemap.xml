        >Long ago, the legends say, there was a secret army. Unseen until
        needed, these warriors struck from the shadows, protecting justice and
        defending the Jushin Empire from both tyrants and thieves. They were
        called the Amen Osa, the Phantom Masters. But now Jushin has fallen, its
        kingdoms destroyed and its citizens left to the mercy of zombies, beasts
        and sadists. Yet from the ashes of destruction, a hero has appeared to
        defend the people. His name is unknown, and no man knows who he
        serves... but there are clues: the strange symbol he wears around his
        neck and the female living weapon he commands. Is he the last of the
        Amen Osa? The answer will be revealed when the Blade of the Phantom
        Master is unleashed!</image:caption
