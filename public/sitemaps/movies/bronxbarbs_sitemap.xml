        >A drama set in the brutal world of Africa's ghettos, Bronx-Barbes opens
        with an introduction to Toussaint and Nixon, two teenaged friends who
        are out of work and commit petty thievery in order to eat. After
        accidentally murdering a ganglord one night, the two are taken under the
        wing of a group of thugs who populate the Bronx, a tough neighborhood
        run by a Mafia-like organization. Toussaint is able to scale the ranks
        of the neighborhood hierarchy, while Nixon ends up in jail for burglary,
        and is only released after Toussaint raises the money to free him.
        Eventually, the friends move on to Barbes, an even rougher neighborhood
        where they find that it takes more than just friendship to
        survive.</image:caption
