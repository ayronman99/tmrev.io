        >An American family celebrates their 28-year-old daughter's pregnancy.
        The celebration is interrupted when a Satanic cult leader, Henrik
        Brandr, unexpectedly visits their ranch. Henrik offers to pay the family
        a large sum for ownership of their land. Jacob Richardson, the father,
        rejects the offer due to the priceless sentimental value of the ranch.
        Henrik, displeased, begins to put devastating curses on the Richardsons,
        trying to force them off their land - even if it means murdering them.
        After suffering unexplainable tragedies, the Richardsons seek help from
        Marybeth, a white witch high priestess. They soon discover a terrible
        secret about their house, revealing why their land is so valuable to the
        cult. They realize they must protect their house from the cult at all
        costs, and a violent battle between good and evil ensues.</image:caption
