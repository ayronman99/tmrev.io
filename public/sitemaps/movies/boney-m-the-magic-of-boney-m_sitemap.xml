        >Boney M were a male/female Euro-disco quartet who were put together by
        producer/writer Frank Farian to perform the commercial songs he had been
        writing. The foursome came together in 1976 and went on to score
        numerous chart hits including a few singles that are still amongst the
        biggest selling records of all time in the UK. This DVD features 20
        video clips and performances by Boney M including 'Rivers Of Babylon',
        'Mary's Boy Child/Oh My Lord', 'Ma Baker', 'Daddy Cool' and more.
