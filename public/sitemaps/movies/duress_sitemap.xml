        >Haunted with nightmares of his wife's recent suicide and struggling to
        mend the relationship with his only daughter, Richard is caught as a
        witness to the violence of Abner Solvie. He finds himself at the mercy
        of a charismatic killer and plagued by his involvement in the city's
        recent murders. As Abner's new found protégé, Richard is forced to adopt
        the mind of his sociopathic mentor in order to protect the one he loves.
