        >Ever wondered what would happen in your own home if you were taken
        away, and everything inside was left to rot? The answer is revealed in
        this fascinating programme, which explores the strange and surprising
        science of decay. For two months in summer 2011, a glass box containing
        a typical kitchen and garden was left to rot in full public view within
        Edinburgh Zoo. In this resulting documentary, presenter Dr George
        McGavin and his team use time-lapse cameras and specialist photography
        to capture the extraordinary way in which moulds, microbes and insects
        are able to break down our everyday things and allow new life to emerge
        from old. Decay is something that many of us are repulsed by. But as the
        programme shows, it's a process that's vital in nature. And seen in
        close up, it has an unexpected and sometimes mesmerising
        beauty.</image:caption
