        >It’s been one year since Elizabeth’s husband, Bill, died in a tragic
        horseback riding accident and she is starting to move on. When she runs
        into Travis Brown, the cowboy she met the same weekend Bill died, the
        two immediately hit it off. Travis is just what Elizabeth needed to come
        into her life and they soon get married. When new evidence surfaces
        implying that Bill’s death wasn’t an accident, Elizabeth must find a way
        to protect herself and her son from the man she married.</image:caption
