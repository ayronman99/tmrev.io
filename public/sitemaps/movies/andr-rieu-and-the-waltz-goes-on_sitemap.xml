        >Once again a fantastic DVD from André Rieu: two-and-a-half hours of
        heart-warming music and fabulous photography, all recorded in Vienna,
        musical capital of the world. Gorgeous Viennese waltzes, songs and
        marches, famous Viennese operettas, dances, beautiful costumes, the
        Johann Strauss Orchestra enjoying skating by the Vienna Town Hall (to
        the strains of a Viennese waltz of course) the golden coach with six
        white horses... and of course André in his starring role as conductor,
        violinist and entertainer. In short, you will hardly be able to take in
        so much beauty all at once! But luckily you can put a DVD on and enjoy
        it again and again.</image:caption
