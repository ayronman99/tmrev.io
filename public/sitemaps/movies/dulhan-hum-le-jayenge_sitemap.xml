        >Sapna has lost her parents at an early age and lives with her three
        quirky uncles - Bhola Nath is a fitness freak, Prabhu Nath is a deeply
        religious fellow and Vicky Nath is a disco-savvy dude. Sapna is fed up
        of their quirks and runs away to Europe where she meets Raja. Her purse
        is stolen and hence she has to depend financially on Raja. During the
        course of the tour they fall in love after much bickering. When Raja
        comes to know that to marry Sapna he has to convince her three uncles
        for their support, he sets off on his mission.</image:caption
