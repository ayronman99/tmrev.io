        >One day at the end of the 1800s, 14-year-old Liseâ€™s life is changed
        forever. She is the eldest of her siblings, the first in her family to
        go to school and full of hope and confidence in life. But when her
        mother goes into labour, it quickly appears that something is wrong. As
        night falls and the labour progresses, Lise begins to understand that a
        day that began in childhood might end with her becoming the woman of the
        house.</image:caption
