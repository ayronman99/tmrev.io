        >On 17 May 1931, the young director Mário Peixoto released his
        masterpiece "Limite" in a premiere in Capitólio Theater in Rio de
        Janeiro to astonished audiences bewildered by the impressive and poetic
        images. Considered by many viewers the best Brazilian movie ever made,
        this feature has never been released commercially. However, in a great
        paradox, Mário Peixoto has never made any other movie. The director
        Sérgio Machado pays a great tribute to the life and work Mário Peixoto
        a.k.a. Maçarico by his close friends with this documentary, using his
        diary; footages of "Limite", the never concluded "Onde a Terra Acaba"
        (1933) and the short "O Homem do Morcego" (1980); and interesting
        testimonies of Olga Breno, Ruy Solberg, Nelson Pereira dos Santos and
        Walter Salles among others.</image:caption
