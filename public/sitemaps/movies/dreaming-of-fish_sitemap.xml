        >In a village on the northeastern coast of Brazil, Jusce, 17, scrapes a
        living by diving 30 meters, with rudimentary equipment, for lobster. His
        "prize" at the end of a long day of risky work is sitting close to Ana,
        who lives with her mother and young daughter, as she savors the drama of
        urban sophisticates on her favorite soap opera. Ana dreams of leaving
        the village to see the world. Jusce is content with the life he leads.
        The other fishermen, friends of Jusce's dead father, help him to buy and
        fit out his own fishing boat. One day an old friend, Rogério, returns
        from the big city to work giving dune buggy rides along the coast. The
        day Rogério gives Jusce a ride to Ana's place marks the beginning of
        their rivalry for Ana's attention. Jusce has to reinvent himself in
        order not to lose Ana to the adventurous life style of
        Rogério.</image:caption
