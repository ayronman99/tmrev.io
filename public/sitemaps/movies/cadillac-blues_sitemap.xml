        >Cadillac Blues is the story of three days in the life of two Lebanese
        brothers, Omar and Ryan. They are very close. They live together,
        sharing the living space, the mobile phone, and a huge old Cadillac. We
        don’t know where their parents are. But they are present only in the
        boys’ conversations. Through a series of dreams and hallucinations, we
        get a glimpse into Ryan’s mental state before his brother does. We are
        given the opportunity to see the world through the eyes of a young man
        struggling with his sexuality in the stuffy environment of the margins.
        He is down with the Cadillac blues.</image:caption
