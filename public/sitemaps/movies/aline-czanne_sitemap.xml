        >“It begins with an exhibition at the French Institute in Munich. We had
        decided to create an installation together [with Vincent Barré] in the
        greenhouse of the Seyssel d’Aix palace: a tribute to Paul Cézanne and
        his final model, the gardener Vallier….We spoke about the project with
        one of Vincent’s childhood friends, Christine Toffin, who reminded us
        that she was related to the painter. Her aunt, the painter’s
        granddaughter, still lived at Bourron-Marlotte. We decided to go and
        film Aline Cézanne in her retirement home at Bourron-Marlotte….It was
        during the sound editing that we thought of making a film using the
        images we had shot for the sound. The framing is minimal – it’s fine as
        it is, but it was not set up with a film in mind. A year later, we went
        back to see Aline. Her speech had become more confused and we went off
        with her to the village to find the houses of her
        childhood.”</image:caption
