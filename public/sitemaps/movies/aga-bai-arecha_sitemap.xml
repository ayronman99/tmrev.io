        >A man suddenly finds that he can hear what women are thinking.
        Shriranga Deshmukh (Ranga) is a frustrated man in life. His frustration
        is particularly towards the women in his life - his wife, his mother and
        particularly his ever-angry boss. He feels they are in control of his
        life. Once on a trip to his native village, he participates in an annual
        festival during which he discovers that he has now gained an ability to
        listen to women's thoughts. At first, he is confused. But soon, on being
        counselled by a female psychologist, he learns to look at his abilities
        as a gift instead of a curse. From that point onwards, the insight into
        the female mind helps him understand the women around him. It helps him
        see their frustrations and dilemmas brought on by everyday life. Being
        good at heart, he slowly starts using this understanding to improve his
        relationship with his wife, mother, grandmother, his boss and even his
        father.</image:caption
