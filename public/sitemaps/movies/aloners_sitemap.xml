        >Jina is the top employee at a credit card company call center. She
        avoids building close relationships, choosing instead to live and work
        alone. One day, her irritating next-door neighbor who would attempt to
        talk with her is discovered dead, several days after having died alone
        in his apartment. Jina is shaken and turns on the home camera installed
        at her motherâ€™s house a long time ago.</image:caption
