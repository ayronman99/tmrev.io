        >Three days in the life of four friends after which there's no going
        back. That moment in your life when everything changes forever. The
        boyish Liza and the girly Sally live in a messy London flat, where they
        consume rather a lot of alcohol and drugs. Sally is working in a cafe,
        while Liza works on songs for their post-punk band. But Liza is also
        consumed with jealousy over Sally's ex, who lives in Germany. Kanchi
        Wichmann’s promising debut contains plenty of sights, sounds and
        sensations that will be familiar to those acquainted with the east
        London queer scene – indeed, a timely sense of place is one of the
        strengths of this twentysomething drama.</image:caption
