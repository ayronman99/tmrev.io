        >In this science fiction thriller, David Whitman (William Hurt) is a
        chemist who lost his wife and child in a freak accident and is trying to
        rebuild his life on his own. While doing research, Whitman discovers a
        series of mysterious deaths that seem to follow in the path of Joseph
        Mueller (Peter Weller), a seemingly ordinary man who works as a security
        guard. Unknown to Mueller, his body carries a strange contaminant that's
        deadly to many people, and Whitman is desperate to find Mueller and stop
        him before he can cause more deaths.</image:caption
