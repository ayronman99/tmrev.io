        >One woman’s journey through a century of love, war and discovery.
        Curiosity, Adventure & Love is a the story of a woman raised by fate to
        go boldly where few young women of her time and upbringing would go,
        into the arms of chance and life. A young American woman leaves her
        country and all security behind, to begin an adventure in the
        Philippines that would witness the birth of a nation, a cruel war and
        Occupation and reconstruction. Jessie is a striking personality,
        somewhere between Scarlett O’Hara and Amelia Earhart, who knew no
        boundaries and flew far ahead of her times, without regard to sex or
        society. Her story of a century well-lived is both rich and one that
        should restore our faith in our own humanity.</image:caption
