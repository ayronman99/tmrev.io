        >Police officer Sedat raids a derelict apartment squatted by a young
        couple. The man is killed, the young woman, Ayşe, escapes. When her
        friends and relatives offer no help, Ayşe is forced to steal cash and a
        car from her father and flee town like an outlaw. The chase goes deeper
        into the wild. Along with three men he has recruited, Sedat is pursuing
        her, out to kill in the name of honour. Taking off from the suburbs of
        Anatolia, Av: The Hunt continues reaching breath-taking natural
        landscapes, and recounts how a young woman is pulled into spiral of
        violence while trying to escape the patriarchal society she lives
        in.</image:caption
