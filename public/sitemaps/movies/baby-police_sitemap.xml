        >Dada, a mischievously sadistic six-year old, constantly bothers his
        neighbors with stealing and pranks. Dada's mother is at her wits end
        when her brother visiting from Lagos offers to take Dada to the big city
        to teach him some discipline. Once there, his uncle begs him to behave.
        And, of course, he doesn't: pretending to be a prophet, Dada scams a
        woman out of a television and demands that another take off her clothes
        in order to perform an exorcism. After being reprimanded by the police,
        Dada attempts to avoid work by stealing his uncle's money and giving it
        to some "businessmen" on the street. When he returns to collect his
        profit, he finds out that he has been tricked. He then decides to pursue
        riches by forming the "Baby Police Force of Nigeria" (which is actually
        comprised entirely of adults except for Dada), and earns money by taking
        money from "criminals" (who are actually just everyday
        people).</image:caption
