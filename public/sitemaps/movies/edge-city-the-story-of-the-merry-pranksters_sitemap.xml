        >This is a documentary on Ken Kesey and the group of hippies that
        "followed" him in the late 50s/60s. They had this yellow painted
        school-bus with a plate "Further" on its front and travelled the whole
        US spreading LSD and their concept of individualism, self-invention and
        freedom. The documentary shows a lot of the footage that was shot on
        16mm during the travels with the bus, and a ton of interviews with
        friends and family of Ken Kesey.</image:caption
