        >Pam meets Rico an Ivatan, and decides to leave her stressful life in
        the city to follow him to Batanes to meet his parents Boy and Lydia and
        marry him. Pam tries to adapt to the Ivatan way of life but hates the
        sea that Rico loves so much. Her hatred for the sea intensifies when her
        husband Rico dies in a fishing accident. Pam is devastated and decides
        to go back to Manila. But when she sensed that the sea was laughing at
        her failure, she chose to stay in Batanes to be with Rico's family. In
        one of her trips to the sea, she accidentally meets Kao Ken Chu, a
        Taiwanese, whom she rescues during a storm. As they spend time together,
        the two eventually fall for each other despite language barriers and
        cultural differences.</image:caption
