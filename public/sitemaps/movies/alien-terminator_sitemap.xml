        >Five miles below the Earth's surface, a group of scientists is working
        in self-imposed isolation, perfecting a series of DNA experiments that
        could literally change the world. But when one of those experiments goes
        awry, it unleashes a nearly immortal organism--one capable of instant
        regeneration, and with an insatiable appetite for living flesh. Soon,
        nothing can contain the creature, and with the lab's life support
        systems quickly shutting down, the scientists grimly prepare for their
        final battle... A small group of scientists are working in self-imposed
        isolation below the Earth's surface. They are all working to create DNA
        which could change the world, but one of the scientists have been given
        an secret assignment, and when the assignment goes wrong, all hell
        breaks lose. The new creation is now aboard the ship and will destroy
        anyone who gets in its way, as it moves towards the
        surface.</image:caption
