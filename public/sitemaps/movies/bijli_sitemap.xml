        >Consider Manhattan a sprawling Hollywood set. Amongst the swarms of
        people that crowd the streets like extras, Fayaaz Bijli is another face
        relegated to the background of our visual spectrum. Come sundown,
        however, and the inconspicuous Fayaaz morphs into the iconic personae of
        ‘Bijli,’ a voluptuous Pakistani drags queen. Yet beneath the flamboyant
        stage presence lies a courageous individual who has carved out a unique
        and cherished identity for herself in a world that has been all too
        quick to label her as an ‘outsider’. Defining herself as a woman stuck
        in a man’s body, Fayaaz has spent her life struggling between the polar
        tensions of male/female, East/West and Islamic faith/promiscuity. This
        film is a glimpse into Fayaaz’s psyche as she navigates her way through
        a New York City life.</image:caption
