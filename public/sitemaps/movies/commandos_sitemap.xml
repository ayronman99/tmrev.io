        >Sgt. Sullivan puts together a group of Italian-Americans into disguise
        as Italian soldiers in order to infiltrate a North African camp held by
        the Italians. After the soldiers have knifed the Italians in their beds,
        they find a hooker living at the camp. Sullivan's commandos are to hold
        this camp and its weaponry until an American battalion arrives, all the
        while these Italian-Americans pretend to be Italian soldiers, often
        hosting the enemy. Lt. Valli is a young, "green," by-the-book officer
        who constantly argues with Sgt. Sullivan, who tells his superior that he
        has no idea what he is doing. One man on the base, probably a touch from
        Argento, is an entomologist who is needlessly killed. Things go terribly
        wrong after that.</image:caption
