        >The Woods in Marion N.Y. have a past. Hunters report unusual activity,
        hikers describe chilling experiences , parents warn their children to
        avoid the woods, and the lucky few who survive the woods alone have all
        gone insane. When a young girl does not heed her parents warning, she
        goes missing in the woods. Three friends decide to document their search
        for the truth. What they witness can't be explained. In the end only one
        is left wandering Awake In The Woods!</image:caption
