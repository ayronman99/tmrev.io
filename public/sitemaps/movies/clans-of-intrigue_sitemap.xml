        >Chu Liuxiang is having drinks with his friend, Monk Wuhua. Gong Nanyan
        of the Holy Water Palace suddenly appears and accuses Chu of having
        stolen the palace's Heaven's One Holy Water and committed a series of
        murders. She agrees to give Chu a month's time to clear his name, or
        else the mistress of the palace will kill him. Chu's curiosity and
        eagerness to prove his innocence spur him to investigate the
        case.</image:caption
