        >ET CONTACT: THEY ARE HERE documents the jaw-dropping stories of
        individuals from around the world who share similar accounts of
        extraterrestrial and otherworldly encounters. Producer and host Caroline
        Cory, who has her own extensive history with the supernatural, takes the
        viewers on an extraordinary journey to uncover whether these seemingly
        independent yet parallel reports may actually be scientific evidence of
        a greater phenomenon at work. Through a series of groundbreaking
        on-camera experiments on human DNA, and interviews with leading
        scientists, viewers will find themselves pondering the nature of their
        own reality or yet the true origin of the human species. ET CONTACT may
        ultimately show that the traditionally unexplained is, in fact, far more
        attributable to science than fiction. NOTE: This film has been released
        in some territories under the title: "Among Us".</image:caption
