        >Once there was a boy Junseop LEE, who's the least liked boy in his
        class. With no true talents, the only thing that makes him stand out
        from his peers is his ability to eat anything. With this talent under
        his belt, his spirits run sky-hight and he can't wait to show off his
        new eating ability. Unfortunately, he doesn't know that a faltering
        dilemma awaits him.</image:caption
