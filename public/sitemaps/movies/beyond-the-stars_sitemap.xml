        >Teenager Eric, the son of a computer scientist who worked for the
        Apollo mission which sent the first human to the moon, is determined to
        become an astronaut himself one day, and befriends Paul Andrews, the
        first man on the moon. Paul is avoided by other astronauts nowadays,
        because he was very rude and rebuffing when he returned from space. Only
        slowly Eric learns, that he discovered something during his excursion on
        the moon, that he keeps as a secret.</image:caption
