        >Talk show host Marc Morin is at a crossroads in his career and in his
        personal life. The ratings of his show are failing and he is losing
        touch with his family. In an effort to regain the love and respect of
        his audience, Marcâ€™s agent decides to send him, against his will, on a
        humanitarian mission to Haiti. Nothing can prepare Marc for the journey
        on which he is about to embark.</image:caption
