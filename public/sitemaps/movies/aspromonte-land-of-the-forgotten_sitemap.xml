        >At the end of the 1950s in Africo, a small village in the southern
        valley of Aspromonte, a woman dies in childbirth because a doctor fails
        to arrive on time. No road connects Africo with the other villages. In
        the wake of this tragedy, all of Africo’s citizens -including children -
        abandon their usual occupations and unite to build their own road.
        Giulia, the new schoolteacher, comes from the North with a mission to
        teach standard Italian to help bring cultural cohesion with Africo and
        the rest of Italy. But she will have to contend with the local maﬁoso
        Don Totó, who is determined to ensure this the town remains cut off, and
        thus, under his power.</image:caption
