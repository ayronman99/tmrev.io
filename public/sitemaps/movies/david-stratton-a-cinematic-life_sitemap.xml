        >A compelling personal journey with David Stratton, as he relates the
        fascinating development of our cinema history. David guides us from his
        boyhood cinema experience of Australia in England, where he saw the
        first images of this strange and exotic landscape via the medium of
        film, to his migration to Australia as a ‘ten pound pom’ in 1963 and
        onto his present day reflections on the iconic themes that run through
        our cinematic legacy. All of this reflects a passionate engagement in a
        uniquely Australian medium. Parallel and at the heart of the series is
        the story of an industry whose growing pains David has witnessed over a
        lifetime. Alongside David, the protagonists of this history are the
        giants of Australian cinema – both behind the camera and in front of
        it.</image:caption
