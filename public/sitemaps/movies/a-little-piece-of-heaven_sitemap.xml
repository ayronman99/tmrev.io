        >A Little Piece of Heaven tells a story of love, friendship, and
        solidarity, aspects of life that allows us to live with dignity even at
        the most difficult of times. Set within the walls of a Communist prison
        of the 1950s, a tale unfolds of a young couples' fragile love. An angry
        young man Lubos always felt defiance toward everything around him, and
        eventually this trait lands him in court. The verdict is clear and the
        punishment long and hard. But even in prison Lubos is unable to tame his
        love of jazz or the eternally blazing flame of rebellion he carries
        inside. There is no place on earth where love cannot grow. Lubos meets
        Dana in prison. Out of solidarity and support, their fellow prisoners
        hatch a small rebellion to help them fulfill their love - a love which
        has appeared in the wrong place at the wrong time.</image:caption
