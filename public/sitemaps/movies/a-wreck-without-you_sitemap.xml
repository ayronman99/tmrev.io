        >Charlie and Alison are in love and it's the real deal. Their time
        together is abruptly cut short, however, when one morning Charlie wakes
        to find the back door to their apartment is wide open, and Alison is
        nowhere to be found. Vanished from his life without a trace, a
        heartbroken Charlie eventually moves on. Years later, living with his
        beautiful new fiancee, and having all but forgotten Alison, Charlie
        receives a mysterious package. The horrifying discovery inside will
        bring Alison back into Charlie's life in a terrible new
        way.</image:caption
