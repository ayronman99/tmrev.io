        >Antarctica: A Frozen History takes a look at the history and stories of
        the human explorations in the Antarctic. Although quite slow paced and
        relatively old, the documentary film successfully incorporates
        reconstructed film material and original Antarctic expedition footage to
        fully illustrate the hardships of the heroic and extreme arctic
        explorations. Human endurance is tested to the maximum, as the
        documentary takes a look back at those who have tried, failed and
        conquered this most unforgiving landscape. Some of these stories entail
        Robert Falcon Scott, a Royal Navy officer and explorer who led two
        expeditions to the Antarctic regions: the Discovery expedition of
        1901–1904 and the ill-fated Terra Nova expedition of 1910–1913. Scott
        reached the South Pole in January 1912 only to find he had been beaten
        to the spot by 33 days. His entire party died on the return journey;
        eight months later, a search party discovered some of their bodies,
        diaries and photographs.</image:caption
