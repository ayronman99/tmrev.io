        >On the night of March 13th, 1997, strange lights were witnessed flying
        over the Phoenix sky, and in their wake a "man" appeared. Jimmy and
        Father Michael feel their lives affected by this stranger. Baffled,
        Father Michael travels to Mexico to seek advice from his mentor. But a
        series of accidents prevents the truth from being revealed, and Father
        Michael is left even more alone and afraid. What he later discovers
        defies his perception of reality and the core of all he has ever
        believed. For Jimmy, the mysterious man provides guidance towards
        finding what he has sought for many years.</image:caption
