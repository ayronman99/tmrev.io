        >The golden, barren landscape of Death Valley, California, recorded by
        Cho from a moving car, provides the luminous and mysterious texture of
        Buoy. As the title suggests, this work reflects on the polar extremes of
        this desert, which was once the floor of a vast sea, now traversed by
        sight-seeing tourists. In contrast to the horizontal landscape, which
        floats ceaselessly past Cho's camera, vertical "strata" pattern the
        imagery, creating an axis between natural landscape and Cho's
        composition. Cho accumulated his Death Valley footage over several
        years; the vertical patterning further represents the collapse of this
        footage into what appears to be a continuous drive through the
        desert.</image:caption
