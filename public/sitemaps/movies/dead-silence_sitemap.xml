        >Jamie returns to his hometown in search of answers to his wife's
        murder, which occurred after receiving a weird package containing a
        ventriloquist dummy named Billy, which may be linked to the legend of
        ventriloquist Mary Shaw. Destined to find out the truth, Jamie goes to
        the town of Raven's Fair, where Shaw used to perform and is buried. But
        Jamie is in for more than he expected.</image:caption
