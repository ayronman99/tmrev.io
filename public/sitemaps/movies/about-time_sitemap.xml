        >The night after another unsatisfactory New Year's party, Tim's father
        tells his son that the men in his family have always had the ability to
        travel through time. They can't change history, but they can change what
        happens and has happened in their own lives. Thus begins the start of a
        lesson in learning to appreciate life itself as it is, as it comes, and
        most importantly, the people living alongside us.</image:caption
