        >Brian Barnes (Johnny Messner) wakes up in the desert wounded and with
        no memory and no idea why he's surrounded by eight bodies, a van with
        four million in cash and a van full of cocaine. Brian is pursued by not
        only notorious drug lord Danny Perez (Danny Trejo) who desperately want
        his money back, and DEA Agent Rooker (Dolph Lundgren), but also a by the
        corrupt Sheriff Olson (Michael Pare) who will stop at nothing to get his
        hand on the new found fortune. On the run, Brian discovers the more he
        remembers the less he wants to know about who he really
        is.</image:caption
