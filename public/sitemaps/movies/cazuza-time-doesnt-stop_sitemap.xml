        >Inspired by the moving book “Só as Mães São Felizes”, by Lucinha
        Araújo, Cazuza's mother, the film covers a little more than 10 years of
        the singer’s crazy and brief life – from the beginning of his career in
        the Circo Voador venue, in 1981, to the huge success and the apotheosis
        of his shows with the Barão Vermelho band, his solo career, his
        relations with his parents, friends, lovers and passions, and the
        courage he had to face his final years, with HIV, until his death, in
        1990.</image:caption
