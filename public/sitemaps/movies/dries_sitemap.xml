        >For the first time fashion designer Dries Van Noten allows a filmmaker
        to accompany him in his creative process and rich home life. For an
        entire year Reiner Holzemer documents the precise steps that Dries takes
        to conceive of four collections, the rich fabrics, embroidery and prints
        exclusive to his designs. As well as the emblematic fashion shows that
        bring his collections to the world and have become cult “must sees” at
        Paris Fashion Week. This film offers an insight into the life, mind and
        creative heart of a master fashion designer who, for more than 25 years,
        has remained independent in a landscape of fashion consolidation and
        globalization.</image:caption
