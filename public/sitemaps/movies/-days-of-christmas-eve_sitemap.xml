        >Calvin Carter, a successful business executive, has it all, but
        neglects those closest to him. On Christmas Eve, all that changes when
        the sign on his office building falls on him. He awakes in a hospital
        bed, attended to by Angie, a nurse who soon lets him know he has 12 days
        (12 chances) to get his act together and achieve the "perfect" Christmas
        Eve. If he doesn't, there will be dire consequences.</image:caption
