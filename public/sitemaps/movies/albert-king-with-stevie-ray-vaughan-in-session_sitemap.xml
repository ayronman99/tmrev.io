        >Recorded for a television program of the same name back in 1983, In
        Session bills itself as the only known recording of Stevie Ray Vaughan
        and Albert King, who was Vaughan's idol and mentor, playing together.
        That leads to some heavy expectations, which fortunately aren't
        disappointed, at least if you aren't expecting the customary
        over-the-top performances Vaughan was famous for. His playing here is
        much more laid-back and controlled, which is actually a
        recommendation--the stylistic similarities between teacher and student
        are that much more pronounced. The songs are mostly King concert
        staples, with the exception of "Pride and Joy"; highlights include the
        T-Bone Walker classic "Call It Stormy Monday" and one of King's own,
        "Overall Junction," which features some excellent guitar solo work. The
        snippets of recorded conversation between songs are interesting
        curiosities as well. --Genevieve Williams</image:caption
