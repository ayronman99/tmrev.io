        >All Chris wants is to be an accountant. This changes forever when a
        demon murders his girlfriend and destroys half of his sleepy college
        campus. Fleeing with Gabriel, the sole surviving member of a celestial
        team of demon hunters, Chris finds himself immersed in a world of
        supernatural terrorsâ€”a world populated by time-traveling gunslingers,
        coniferous bounty hunters, and the very demon who killed his friends.
        Can Chris learn to fight back and survive the horrors of Dead Camper
        Lake, or will he literally find himself in Hell?</image:caption
