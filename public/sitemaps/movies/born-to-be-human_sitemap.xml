        >Yang Shi-Nan is a 14-year-old boy who undergoes a metamorphosis without
        realising what is going on. It begins on a normal school day when he
        gets stomach cramps. After rushing to the toilet he notices that his
        urine is turning bloody red. Taken to a doctor he is diagnosed with
        “Disorders of Sex Development,” or intersex. Without consulting him,
        Shi-Nan’s parents decide to accept “sex reassignment surgery”, turning
        Shi-Nan into a female and changing her name to YANG Shi-Lan. The family
        moves to a new city to start a new life and it all seems to be going
        well as Shi-Lan blends in and even makes friends. It seems like the
        butterfly is about to break out of its chrysalis but can Yang Shi-Lan
        truly embrace her transformation?</image:caption
