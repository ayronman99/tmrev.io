        >Africa, Europe - Europe and Africa: Surfers live differently on each
        continent and Africa marks a special place - as surfing is in many
        places at its very beginnings. 'Beyond - An African Surf Documentary'
        follows locals along the coast of Morocco, Western Sahara, Mauritania,
        Senegal and Gambia into their homes, visits their home surf spots and
        takes a look into their surfing lives. Three months of shooting
        culminated in a 111 minute long episodic journey on a continent, that
        has the potential to be the next big thing in surfing.</image:caption
