        Hell, very few vids these days have much energy to them. They all seem
        to be about nailing the trick - which is important - but there's also
        this thing called cinematography. 2nd To None has a fast pace and
        awesome skating. The intro montage is stunning. Filmed in the warehouse,
        it features the team sessioning everything from the top of a forklift to
        jumping gaps from one product rack to another. They pile stuff high and
        go wild on every surface in the place - including a few ramps. Some
        street footy is edited in as well. This vid is so well done, it's
        insane. Each rider has a part, some of which is in the warehouse, but
        most is out on the streets. They mix in some skits and other random
        stuff. There's a "Chariots of Fire" routine in which they push - in
        super slow-mo - doing a variety of tricks while trying to sabotage each
        other's runs.</image:caption
