        >This captivating exploration of Alvar Aalto, the defining figure in
        Scandic design and one of Europe's greatest modern architects, focuses
        on his remarkable and loving partnership with wife, Aino. Theirs was a
        profoundly humanist vision that put people at the centre of design, and
        ranged from work in furniture design through to huge architectural
        projects. They mixed with, and influenced, major figures of modernist
        art and design including Le Corbusier, Gropius, Moholy-Nagy, and Frank
        Lloyd Wright. Come on a cinematic tour of their iconic buildings all
        over the world, from a library in Russia, a student dormitory at MIT, an
        art collector's private house near Paris, to a pavilion in Venice.
        Narrated by experts in the field and featuring never before seen archive
        footage, Aalto tells the love story of an extraordinary couple with a
        great passion for human scale architecture.</image:caption
