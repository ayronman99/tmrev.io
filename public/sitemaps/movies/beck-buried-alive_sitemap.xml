        >In a playground in the centre of the urban idyll, the police find a
        buried wooden box containing a famous and well-respected prosecutor.
        Martin Beck and his police team initially suspect a highly criminal
        MC-leader of the attack, but one pretty soon has to re-evaluate the case
        once the MC-leader is found murdered in a similar wooden box. Soon, more
        wooden boxes are found and the police realize that they are part of a
        cat and mouse game with a crazy serial killer. The investigation soon
        shows that there is a vague connection between the victims in the shape
        of a 9 year old event, but what Martin Beck does not suspect is that his
        own life too is at stake, as the murderer has chosen him as the next
        victim.</image:caption
