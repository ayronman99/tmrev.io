        >Legendary hip-hop DJ Jason Mizell, aka Jam Master Jay, is gunned down
        in his Queens studio. Security tapes of the incident mysteriously
        disappear, the five witnesses are uncooperative and no one is talking...
        until now. 2 Turntables and a Microphone documents the investigation of
        the unsolved murder of Jam Master Jay, RUN- DMC's groundbreaking DJ and
        producer, deftly revealing the history of hip-hop and mainstream rap
        along the way. Exclusive, candid interviews with 50 Cent, Ja Rule,
        Russell Simmons, RUN-DMC, LL Cool J, The Game, and more offer insight
        into Jam Master Jay's life - including information that could finally
        help police solve the murder that shook the music world to its
        core.</image:caption
