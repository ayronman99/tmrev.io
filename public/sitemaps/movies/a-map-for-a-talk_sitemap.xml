        >An intimate play evolving around three main characters: an adult woman,
        her mother and her female lover. Two days in their lives occur in two
        opposing setting, everyday life in the demanding metropolis of Santiago
        and a sailboat trip cruising a beautiful bay. The three character remain
        trapped in a claustrophobic confrontation. The film dialogs with 'Knife
        in the water' from the side of women, an intense character drama with
        many involuntary humorous scenes. The eternal, never completed quest of
        seeing and recognizing the other as they are or, at least, as they want
        to be seen.</image:caption
