        >Jenny, a young single mother and her son Harry are fleeing domestic
        abuse from her violent ex. She desperately needs to rent a house away,
        anywhere far away from him. Morton, the estate agent, however has
        ulterior motives and insists she takes a mysterious house that he is
        selling. Morton takes more than a passing interest in her son, and her
        friend Elizabeth warns Jenny that her ex is out for blood and sheâ€™s in
        danger of losing more than a roof over her head.</image:caption
