        >Najwa, Nawal and Siham, three Palestinian widows, live with their 11
        children in a house on Shuhada Street in Hebron. Their house lies on the
        border; the fa√ßade is under Israeli occupation, the Palestinian
        authority controls the back. At the entrance to the house a military
        post, on the roof the Israeli army has placed a watch point over
        Palestinian Hebron. Three women, trapped in the middle, constantly
        surrounded by Israeli soldiers, carry on their difficult lives in a
        perverse situation: the occupation becomes a routine, the absurd becomes
        a given. This is the story of an occupation that extends to the
        staircase and the roof of the house, where it encounters poverty,
        loneliness, pain, but also the small joys of everyday life. This is an
        internal prison, the external one is the ongoing
        occupation.</image:caption
