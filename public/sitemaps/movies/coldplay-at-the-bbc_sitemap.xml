        >Coldplay showcased several tracks from their new album in an open-air
        concert at the BBC Television Centre in London. The gig – broadcast live
        on BBC Two – featured new material such as 'Violet Hill' and '42',
        alongside old favorites including 'Clocks', 'Fix You' and 'In My Place'.
        The band left the main stage briefly to perform an acoustic version of
        'Yellow' against the backdrop of the Television Centre building. The gig
        ended with a rousing version of 'Lovers in Japan' that involved
        showering the crowd with thousands of paper butterflies.</image:caption
