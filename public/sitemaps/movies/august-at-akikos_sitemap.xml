        >Musician Alex sets off to an island to find his ancestral home with
        only childhood memories as his navigational system. As he fails to find
        his home, he reaches a retreat run by a Buddhist woman, Akiko, where he
        decides to stay for a while. Over a course of few weeks, they share a
        special spiritual bond out of music and therapeutic
        techniques.</image:caption
