        >Three boys and three girls. All born in the Middle East now living in
        Sweden. All with different views of Islam, integration, the World and
        Sweden. Some follow Sharia. Others fight Islamic roles. One is a hip
        hopper. The other thinks music is a sin. One thinks that the woman must
        obey her husband. One fights for womenâ€™s liberation. One girl is a
        boxer. The other is an ordinary worker. Some are closely followed by the
        Security Police. Children of Islam is a documentary about religion,
        culture, conflicts and looking for an identity in a changing
        Sweden.</image:caption
