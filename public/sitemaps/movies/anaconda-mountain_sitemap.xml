        >Huang Shen, Lin Wei and a group of their coworkers went to Mangshan to
        find news to save the newspaper company they work for, from bankruptcy.
        Instead of the news they encountered a giant snake raised by Aunt Mei.
        The group was attacked several times, but were also rescued by a
        mysterious person, and then lured to a foggy forest which they can't
        escape. Huang Shen must do his best to help everyone survive and defeat
        the snake.</image:caption
