        >The rookie journalist Vivian seeks Frederick, the caretaker of the
        oldest cemetery in an undefined country, asking for an interview and the
        old man tells the story of two "costumers" and both connected by a
        mysterious secret. The powerful gangster Jimmie Levinson accuses his
        former partner Paul Pattuchi of stealing a load of cocaine and orders to
        kill his beloved girlfriend Clarice. Paul is found dead later in a
        cottage, and Jimmie and his friends and girlfriends are visited during a
        dinner party by Robert Downing first and then by the sadistic Mortimer
        and his partner Rick seeking the truth about Paul and a suitcase with a
        mysterious relic. The second story takes place in the Middle Ages, where
        the cruel David Deming and his minion Tom Brewster chase the renegade
        priest James Flynn in the name of the Inquisition but actually trying to
        force him to reveal the secret of the Eternal Heart to grant
        immortality.</image:caption
