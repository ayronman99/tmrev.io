        >After 15 years of marriage, David and Marianne have grown apart. David
        has had an affair with a patient of his and Marianne has got herself
        involved with her former lover Carl-Adam, who's also David's best
        friend. When she travels to Copenhagen to meet Carl-Adam, David takes
        the same train as she does, making it look coincidental. Spending time
        together remembering their past and talking about their future, they
        come to understand each other again, which leads to a
        reconciliation.</image:caption
