        >From the little theaters of the 1920s to the ad hoc film societies of
        the 50s, avant-garde cinema knew no established form and held no
        predictable position. The boundaries of its history are still hotly
        debated, but its rough sensibilities informed and permeated the city
        symphonies of Alberto Cavalcanti, the visual music of Mary Ellen Bute
        and John Whitney, the classroom films of Sidney Peterson, the
        confessional film poems of Willard Maas and John E. Schmitz, the
        Lettrist cinema of Marc’O, and even marginal exploitation films and home
        movies. Drawn from the rich collections of Raymond Rohauer and the
        George Eastman House, Kino’s third volume of experimental films
        continues to illuminate the degree to which cinema’s evolution has been
        influenced by those filmmakers who occupy its periphery.</image:caption
