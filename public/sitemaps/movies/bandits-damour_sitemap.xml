        >A young woman who has gone over to the wrong side of the law with her
        new boyfriend begins having second thoughts about both crime and her new
        romance in this drama. Helene is an attractive 18-year-old who has
        fallen for Paul, a 25-year-old drifter, and one evening as they're
        having drinks in a cafe in the North of France, Paul decides to rob the
        bank across the street. Though wary, Helene agrees to help, and soon the
        couple is 40,000 francs richer -- and on the run from the law. The two
        hop a train to Marseilles, but it isn't long before Helene begins to
        think the robbery was a bad idea -- and isn't certain if her
        relationship with Paul is such a good thing either. Paul, however, isn't
        troubled by any second thoughts, and is very certain about his feelings
        for Helene -- so much so that he forces a priest to marry them at
        gunpoint. This is only the most recent manifestation of Paul's volatile
        personality, and rather than binding Helene closer to him, it only
        drives her farther away.</image:caption
