        >Chico Buarque is a constant presence in Brazil's art scene and makes up
        its citizen's popular culture. This wealth in music, poems, theater and
        novels has been created over the last 50 years and in this film Chico
        Buarque converses about his memories, shows, daily life, work methods,
        creative process, in summary all his trajectory. The musicianâ€™s search
        for his German brother, whom he never got to meet, serves as one of the
        axis for the narrative.</image:caption
