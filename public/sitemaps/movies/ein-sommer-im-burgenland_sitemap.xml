        >While Berlin-based businessman Paul Graf is in Shanghai, his nosy
        busybody mother Maria, who was only to mind his apartment, opens his
        mail, finds a letter notifying he's to become father and without
        consulting him travels to see the expectant mother, Nina, at her home,
        uncle Harald Brandl's farm and stork home. Maria falls in love with
        Harald but also finds the key to the Graf family's past, fled from
        Hungary during the Soviet-crushed rebellion. Paul arrives and finds Nina
        impossible to deal with, yet wants a bond with his unborn
        son.</image:caption
