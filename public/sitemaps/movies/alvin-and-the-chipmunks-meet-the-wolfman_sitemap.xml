        struggling with nightmares of werewolves. Alvin believes that the new

        him. Meanwhile, the boys are working on the school production of Dr.
        Jekyll & Mr. Hyde. When Alvin blows up the school auditorium, he is
        expelled from the production. Theodore is put in to rise his lack of
        confidence. Alvin and Simon are trying to discover the secret of Mr.
        Talbot. Will the play go as planned or will the Chipmunks mess it
        up?!</image:caption
