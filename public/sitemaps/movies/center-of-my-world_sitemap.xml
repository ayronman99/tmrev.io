        >A strange family: 17-year-old Phil lives with his mother and twin
        sister in an old mansion on the outskirts of town. When he returns from
        summer camp, the mood in the mansion has soured somehow. Phil doesnâ€™t
        worry about it, hanging out with his best friend Kat instead. When he
        starts to feel attracted to a mysterious new student at school, Phil is
        plunged into emotional turmoil only exacerbated by the trouble at
        home.</image:caption
