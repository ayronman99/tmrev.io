        >Guy's father was a hero during the French Resistance era but he never
        talks about it, or so little. When he dies,Guy, his brother and his
        sister have him incinerated, following a wish their dad had expressed
        when he was still alive. But Guy soon starts feeling uncomfortable about
        this move. Haven't they, by cremating the body of their father, make a
        hero disappear from man's memory? Haven't they used the same method as
        the Nazis to get rid of the remains of a hated enemy?</image:caption
