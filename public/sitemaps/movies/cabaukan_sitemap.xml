        >Ca Bau Kan relates the saga of Giok Lan, an Indonesian woman living in
        the Netherlands, who returns to Indonesia in search of her roots. Her
        mother, Tinung, a village woman, was known as ‘Ca Bau Kan’ – a word used
        to describe a courtesan who entertained Chinese men in colonial
        Indonesia. Giok Lan’s father, Tan Peng Liang (Ferry Salim), was an
        immigrant Chinese merchant who had a very successful tobacco business in
        Batavia. She becomes deeply involved with him, and causes a scandal when
        he has Tinung move in with his family. The film is set between 1930 and
        1950, and unfolds the story of Giok Lan and her parents: Tinung and Tan
        Peng Liang where Tan is eventually ruined when his rivals begin to
        attack him. This is owing to the significant contrast in socio-economic
        and cultural background, as the love of these last two characters face a
        series of difficulties.</image:caption
