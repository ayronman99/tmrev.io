        >Blood Child is horror thriller based on a true story. Bill and Ashely
        DiAngelo seem to have it all, an overseas posting to Singapore, life in
        paradise and a new baby on the way. But tragedy strikes when she loses
        the baby and sinks into a deep depression. Unbeknownst to Bill, Ashley
        decides that the only way for her to "be" with her miscarried child is
        to dabble in the South East Asian occult practice of raising her own
        "ghost child". She seeks the help of her Indonesian maid, Siti, tasking
        her to find a bomoh (witch doctor) who knows how to trap the spirit of
        unborn dead fetuses. Siti tries to dissuade Ashley from resorting to
        such dark magic but to no avail. In the meantime, in an effort to put
        the tragic events of the miscarriage behind them, Bill decides that it
        would be good for the couple to return home to Minnesota to start their
        lives over. Several months after their return to the US, Ashley and Bill
        are surprised to find themselves pregnant again....</image:caption
