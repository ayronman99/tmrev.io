        >During Mongolia's seventy years of domination by the Soviet Union,
        shamanism, like many aspects of Mongolian tradition, was forbidden by
        the Communist authorities, and went into decline. Since the early 1990s,
        however, it has been undergoing a revival, eager to regain its place in
        Mongolian cultural identity. This film explores the life of the
        shaman-master Tomor, at his centre in Ulaan Baatar.</image:caption
