        >The Brooklyn Dodgers, from Jackie Robinson's breaking baseball's color
        barrier to their move to Los Angeles, a dozen years later. The Dodgers
        epitomize the diverse working-class, in contrast with the white uptown
        Yankees, and come oh-so-close to winning the World Series before it
        finally happens in 1955. By then, Ebbets Field is crumbling, ticket
        sales are off, fans have moved to the suburbs, and Robert Moses is
        blocking Walter O'Malley's plan to build a stadium at the terminus of
        the Long Island Railroad. When Los Angeles makes O'Malley an offer he
        can't refuse, an era comes to an end: in 1958 the Dodgers and
        cross-town-rival Giants go West, leaving the ghosts of
        Flatbush.</image:caption
