        >A disgruntled married man called Tom believes that there is a better
        life for him out there somewhere. On his way home one night he gets
        attacked and falls into a parallel world where he lives 6 other lives
        including a Rock-Star, A homeless person and the 'hoody' that attacked
        him. These lives help him to re-evaluate his priorities and values but
        in order to get home he must face some of his deepest fears and desires.
        Will he make it home or is the grass greener on the other
        side?</image:caption
