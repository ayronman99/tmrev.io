        >As a B grade erotic theater group is about to close down, affected by
        the economic recession, they decide to perform a proper theater play for
        their last show as they have always been dreaming of. Their choice of
        play is the classic theater play, 'Hamlet'. However, once the theater
        play has started running, their performance goes to an unexpected
        direction due to the mistakes and adlib they never thought were going to
        happen on the stage. Will their curtain call occur happily as they hoped
        in the beginning?</image:caption
