        >An elderly man pines away in a nursing home. His family calls on him
        out of a guilty conscience, but they try to get away from the stuffy
        atmosphere as soon as possible. The old man obliges them and behaves
        unresponsive. But as soon as everybody is gone, he smiles contented
        while softly speaking to his canary Arie. The human form the bird
        suddenly assumes is the kick-off for an adventure.</image:caption
