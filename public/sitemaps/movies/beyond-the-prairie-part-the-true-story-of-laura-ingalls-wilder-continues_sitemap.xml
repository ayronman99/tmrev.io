        >Laura, her husband Almanzo and their daughter Rose leave South Dakota
        and head for Missouri in search of a better, more financially stable
        life. It's a daunting journey, but they're sustained by their resolve.
        However, they're faced with an even greater challenge after their
        arrival: an ailing and bedridden Almanzo is unable to tend their new
        land. With winter fast on its way, Laura attempts to clear the land
        herself and plant the acres of apple trees that they hope will ensure
        their future.</image:caption
