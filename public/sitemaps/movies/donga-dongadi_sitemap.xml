        >Vasu (Manchu Manoj Kumar) is a strong willed reckless guy. He spends
        most of his time hanging out with his friends, who belong to the same
        flock. He loves his father (Manikka Vinayagam) and his brother (Rajeev
        Kanakala) very dearly. His brother is different from him that he is
        responsible and studious. He ignores his father's words of wisdom and is
        regularly chided by his father as a good-for-nothing guy. In one such
        incident he loses the trust and faith of his father as he gets involved
        in teasing a girl called Vijji (Sadha). That incident makes Vasu realize
        the importance of having good relationship with his father. But father
        asks him to prove himself as a responsible man.</image:caption
