        >Over a century ago Pirate's Point was overrun by pirates, led by
        Abraham LeVoy, who became known as Pirate Death. He looted from the
        town, slaughtering over 150 men, women and children and then hid the
        treasure. Unaware of the terrifying and tortuous nature of Pirate Death,
        a group of college students researching their "pirate" heritage decide
        to locate the hidden treasure of Pirate Death.</image:caption
