        >For Marko, life mainly consists of frozen pizzas and back pain. For
        almost 30 years, the widower has been hauling frozen goods for the
        company "Eisland" to the front doors of his mostly older customers. When
        Marko has to take early retirement due to illness, his life gets into
        imbalance. Thereby Marko has only one goal: his studying son should have
        it better one day. Lawyer or judge, that would be something. The main
        thing is no work where you have to wear a name tag. The decease of an
        old female customer unexpectedly opens up a whole new business model for
        Marko. Unfortunately, he reckoned without the nosy neighbors. To make
        matters worse, his own son also finds out about it. Marko's house of
        cards threatens to collapse. Then he meets his idol Roland Kaiser at the
        bar.</image:caption
