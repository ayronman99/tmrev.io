        >In 1945, as America's soldiers come home to ticker-tape parades and
        overjoyed families, Private First Class Donny Novitski, singer and
        songwriter, returns to rebuild his life with only the shirt on his back
        and a dream in his heart. When NBC announces a national competition to
        find the nation's next great musical superstars, inspiration strikes!
        Donny joins forces with a motley group of fellow veterans, forming a
        band unlike any the nation has ever seen. Along the way, they discover
        the power of music to face the impossible, find their voice and finally
        feel like they have a place to call home.</image:caption
