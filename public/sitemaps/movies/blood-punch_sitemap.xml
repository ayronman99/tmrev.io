        >Milton, a college dropout, was only supposed to cook meth for one day.
        Broken out of rehab by a brash young woman and her trigger-happy ("ex")
        boyfriend and driven to a remote cabin the woods, Milton finds himself
        drawn into a dangerous love triangle gone haywire. The couple's deadpan
        half-truths spin around Milton like a song on repeat. They seem to read
        him like an open book, until a mysterious message opens his eyes to his
        cursed existence. With unlimited ammunition, any hunting tool they could
        desire, and an ever-growing body count, for what did Milton really sign
        up?</image:caption
