        >(Long Synopsis) "When former tennis pro Owen “Game Set” Match gets
        fired from his cushy job instructing at the affluent Fountain Club, he’s
        forced to take a position at the gritty public courts of the Derby City
        Recreation Center. There he contends with his new co-workers, a ragtag
        group of tennis pro misfits; his boss Sherry, a strong-willed, single
        mother; and her son Jake, a goth teenager and secret tennis hopeful.
        Slowly Owen begins to win over his colleagues, mend his broken
        friendships and help Jake fix his serve … and develops a romantic
        connection with Sherry, despite her insistence that she doesn't date
        tennis pros. Just when things seem to be looking up, Owen’s former boss
        and court nemesis challenges the Derby City club to a showdown in the
        annual Combo Cup tennis tournament. As he leads his team of oddball
        amateurs, Owen learns the most valuable lesson of all … On the court or
        off, everyone deserves a second chance!"</image:caption
