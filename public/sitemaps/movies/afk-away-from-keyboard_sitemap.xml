        >/afk - AWAY FROM KEYBOARD explores the relationship between online
        gamers and the games that they play. It examines the evolution of the
        World of Warcraft from its infancy to its non-existent conclusion and
        beyond, into the world of obsession. Through the lives of several key
        characters, it shows the joys associated with online games, and offers a
        objective look at some of its inherent trappings. /afk seeks to create a
        dialog about gamers in an attempt to bring understanding to the online
        gaming phenomenon and the millions of gamers behind the World of
        Warcraft; the most successful MMO of all time. In doing so, one might
        assert that gaming can no sooner be understood than that of any other
        form of addiction: if it's an addiction at all.</image:caption
