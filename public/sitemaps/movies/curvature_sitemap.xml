        >Helen tries to cope with the recent death of her husband, a scientist
        who killed himself right when he was on the verge of successfully
        completing the invention of a time machine. One day, she receives a
        phone call, and a voice suspiciously resembling her own voice warns her
        that sheâ€™s in danger. Is it possible Helen has time travelled? And what
        could have led her to do something like that?</image:caption
