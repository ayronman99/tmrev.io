        >Desire Will Set You Free is a feature film that explores life in
        contemporary Berlin with an often critical and sometimes humorous eye.
        Based on a true story, the plot follows the relationship of an American
        writer of Israeli/Palestinian descent and a Russian aspiring artist
        working as a hustler, offering access to the city's vibrant queer and
        underground scenes while examining the differences between expatriate
        and refugee life. Our characters travel through Berlin's layered history
        and unique subcultural landscape; on their adventures they discover
        influences and remnants of the Weimar Republic, WWII, the Bowie years,
        and punk.</image:caption
