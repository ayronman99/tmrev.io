        >Thomas Young, Roderick Dixon, and Victor Trent Cook do not have the
        level of name recognition enjoyed by the other three tenors, Jos√©
        Carreras, Placido Domingo, and Luciano Pavarotti, but in this concert,
        taped for a Great Performances telecast, they show spectacular depth and
        a variety of talents. They begin with opera, sharing solos in "La donna
        e mobile," and other operatic material is included--notably "Nessun
        dorma," which is one of Pavarotti's signature tunes, and "Ah! mes amis"
        from La Fille du Regiment, with its formidable series of high Cs. But a
        livelier agenda is established with "Let the Good Times Roll," and the
        program expands to include pop, blues, Broadway, spirituals, and even a
        touch of patriotism in "America the Beautiful." Cook has the biggest
        show-stopper: Cab Calloway's "Minnie the Moocher." --Joe
