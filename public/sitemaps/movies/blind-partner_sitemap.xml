        >A boring and ordinary life. Jun-young and Sung-jun may have something
        unusual, but they are bored with their daily routines. Then one day,
        Sung-jun learned about an invitation-only blind party from a junior in
        the company. Is there any reason for any man not to go? The place was
        full of excitement. Jun-yeong opened the door and while the place looked
        so much different, he could still recognize it instantly. One day
        without any word, a woman, Na-young, disappeared like a smoke. Because
        of a rule that he cannot ask anything, he ended up having sex with
        Na-young, and just like that, she disappears. Jun-yeong couldn’t tell if
        he’s dreaming or not. When he met Sung-jun and talked about what
        happened, Sung-joon will give him the contact details of the blind party
        organizer. After much thought, he finally contacted the host to see
        Na-young again. Na-young waits for Jun-yeong in the hotel room. How will
        the night be for Na-young and Jun-yeong?</image:caption
