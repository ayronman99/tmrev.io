        >Millions of people the world over look to Christianity for guidance and
        healing, and the Bible, the source by which they're educated, has come
        to transcend text, entering a realm of something much more powerful and
        important. Such blind devotion to the Bible and its teachings were not

        the religion.</image:caption
