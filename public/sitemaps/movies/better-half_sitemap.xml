        >For years, Tony and Leo have been a happy couple. They had always
        talked about having a child... someday. So when a sickly infant is
        abandoned at a local hospital, Tony sees it as a sign. Suddenly, Leo is
        confronted with making good on his promise to start a family; he must
        face his deep-seeded fears of being a father, or risk losing Tony
        altogether.</image:caption
