        >Jacob is tired of living on the family farm, submitting to the rules of
        his father. One day he demands an early inheritance from his father, who
        shocks his young son by agreeing to give it to him. So, he heads to the
        big city doing things his way without restraint, and for a while he does
        well-surprisingly well. He takes huge business risks and converts his
        small fortune into a big fortune, despite his extremely flamboyant
        lifestyle that attracts the wrong women, including seductive Laura,
        whose rich boyfriend Frank is often dangerously nearby. Jake had it all:
        money, ladies, prestige-but then-he loses it all and just when he things
        he's hit bottom the bottom drops some more- until he is eating out of
        dumpsters and eventually ends up living in a literal pig pen. Coming to
        his senses he heads home, determined to work in an entry level position
        for his dad, who surprises him once again by running to him-but is it to
        kiss him or kill him?</image:caption
