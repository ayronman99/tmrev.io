        >Respected and very wealthy Atlanta, GA-area realtor Bobby Wilson has a
        wife, son and daughter, but does some things unknown to them. He has a
        cabin on a rural tract 200 miles to the north, to where he often flies
        his airplane carrying abducted, minimally-attached females, who he there
        releases as game and fatally hunts. A girlfriend of a victim convinces a
        cop to help close in on Bobby.</image:caption
