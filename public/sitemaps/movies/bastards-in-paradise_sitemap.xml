        >A shootout in the center of Stockholm, which is the cause of a tragic
        and casual reunion after a long time, between Manuel - a gang leader -
        Lena, who it was his great love, aspiring to police officer, and Kalle,
        who was his great friend and now he is a janitor of a discoteque; in a

        forever</image:caption
