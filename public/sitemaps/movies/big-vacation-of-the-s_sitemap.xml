        >Documentary-chronicle." A film about the 30s of the twentieth century,
        built exclusively on chronicle footage. His epilogue may be the phrase:

        walk with children, celebrate the New Year. This is a montage picture
        from excerpts of chronicle films of the 30s. The chronicles depict many
        demonstrations, processions, speeches, but in detail the life of not
        gods and giants, but the most ordinary people who make history is
        guessed.</image:caption
