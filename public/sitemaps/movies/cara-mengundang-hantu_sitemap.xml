        >In "Cara Mengundang Hantu" a chilling tale is composed out of four
        short stories that explain how to invite a ghost. The first story is
        about a banana tree that was chopped in half by Rizal. He will be
        haunted by a ghost because of his gambling and money lending issues. The
        second story is between a mom and son where the son disobeyed his mom
        and has to face the consequences. The third story is about a group of
        students that go against ancient beliefs and the fourth story is about
        revenge where a spirit hunts down its murderer.</image:caption
