        >On June 9, 1997, Ben Folds Five was one of the first guests to appear
        on a new series called Sessions at West 54th. Because of the 1/2 hour
        time constraint of the show, only a handful of the recorded tracks made
        it to air. The DVD contains the entire performance which, for the most
        part, includes tracks from their just released album, Whatever and Ever
        Amen. The DVD includes Spare Reels, a 45 minute film which contains live
        performances and clips of the band in various and random situations. It
        also contains clips of Ben Folds Five during the studio sessions for
        their then upcoming album, The Unauthorized Biography of Reinhold
        Messner.</image:caption
