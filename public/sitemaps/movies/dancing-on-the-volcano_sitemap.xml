        >Maarten is an ordinary 16-year-old. He likes to hang around in the
        park, listen to music, play videogames and dance as much as possible.
        Preferably with his dance partner Roxanne. But almost nobody, especially
        not Roxanne, knows he has a metabolic disease that could end his life.
        Despite the concerns of his parent, Maarten wants to live life to the
        fullest. But with his body failing him more and more, maybe the time has
        come to accept he is not ordinary.</image:caption
