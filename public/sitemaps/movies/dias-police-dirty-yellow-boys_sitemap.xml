        >About 150,000 illegal entrants live in Tokyo. They are not recognised
        as refugees and live in poor conditions. To protect themselves, the
        illegals create a secret organisation. The organisation has a bank which
        Japanese Financial Services Agency is not involved with, a hospital that
        is not authorized by Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare
        and an illegals police force called "Dias Police." The only police
        officer in the organisation is Saki Kubozuka (Shota Matsuda). His age
        and nationality is unknown. Saki Kubozuka does not speak much, but he
        has a warm heart and strong sense of justice. He takes care of the weak
        and tries to maintain public order.</image:caption
