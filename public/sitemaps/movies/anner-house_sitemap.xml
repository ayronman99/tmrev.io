        >'Anner House' is a romantic story of dreams and aspirations. Neil Barry
        leaves Ireland after a bitter divorce and custody battle to face the
        demons of his alcoholism in another place, Cape Town. A chance meeting
        with an Irish woman, named Ruth Maguire, also trying to extricate
        herself from an unhappy relationship with Nicky helps him embark on a
        journey of self-healing and personal discovery. Inspired by the colorful
        locals they encounter, and the magical places they visit, Neil helps
        Ruth fulfill her dream, to open a boutique hotel set against the
        stunning Cape landscape. They decide to call it 'Anner House'. Of course
        the dream has its own obstacles - their personal predicaments plus
        coping with the social problems unique to Cape Town. But in the end it
        becomes clear to Neil and Ruth that they are the solutions to their own
        problems and the mutual attraction that sparked between them when they
        first met becomes irresistible.</image:caption
