        >When Sebastian Youngstrum meets the older, handsome Max Taymer, a
        forbidden world awakens in the mind of the young man. The line between
        fantasy and reality is blurred when experimentations in taboo sex go too
        far. Sebastian wants more and Max is more than willing to lead him down
        the path of torture, pain and even murder. Images of dead bar patrons,
        bodybuilders, hustlers, and party boys consume his mind and affect his
        daily life. His best-friend, Gina Claremore, knows something has
        changed. With a growing feeling of distrust towards Max and a paranoid
        feeling that someone is stalking Sebastian, Gina tries to intervene. But
        it's too late.</image:caption
