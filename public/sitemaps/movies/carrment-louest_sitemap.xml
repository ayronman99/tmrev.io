        >In Paris, where he wields his money scams, Alex has an unexpected
        encounter with two girls: Fred, who’s nothing to do with his world and
        who he falls for straight away, and Sylvia – sweet, but lonely, Sylvia.
        To test Alex, Fred devises a curious game of seduction. Like a character
        out of a Marivaux play, she toys with setting up delightful obstacles
        necessary to Love’s flourishing: Sylvia must seduce Alex, and Alex, must
        in turn, truly desire Sylvia. But Fred gets caught in her own trap. She
        falls head over heels in love with Alex. However, he no longer knows who
        to choose, all the more so now that Sylvia is falling in love with him,
        too. During an eventful night of confusion and intrigue, crazy laughter
        and tears, our threesome come to realize that what really draws them
        together is an emotional bond: true love.</image:caption
