        >“In 1946, my great-grandfather murdered a black man named Bill Spann
        and got away with it.” So begins Travis Wilkerson’s critically acclaimed
        documentary, DID YOU WONDER WHO FIRED THE GUN?, which takes us on a
        journey through the American South to uncover the truth behind a
        horrific incident and the societal mores that allowed it to happen.
        Acting as narrator and guide, Wilkerson spins a strange, frightening
        tale, incorporating scenes from TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, the music of
        Janelle Monáe and Phil Ochs, and the story of Rosa Parks’ investigation
        into the Recy Taylor case, as well as his own family history, for a
        gripping investigation into our collective past and its echoes into the
        present day.</image:caption
