        >When Suei was little, his mother had an affair with a young man who
        lived next door. Suei's mother and the young man killed themselves by
        using dynamite. After Suei graduated from high school, he worked at a
        factory before quitting his job. He then went to Tokyo and began working
        in the erotic magazine industry. Suei eventually became the chief editor
        of a famous erotic magazine in the 1980's.</image:caption
