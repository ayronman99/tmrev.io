        an early age, he already has what he wants and now he feels bored to
        live day by day. But there is one thing that still turns him on and that
        is steeling. Yeah, that you have in mind-To break into somebody's house
        and get the valuables without permission. Using his ingenuity, he even

        rate of failure. He picked out a victim for no reason and this time,
        narrow a chicken-hearted public serviceman Sang-tae is the poor one. He
        is a naive person who's happy when he watches TV with his beloved wife
        and the kids. But with Gang-jo's continuous burglary, Sang-tae, who
        can't prevent Gang-jo from steeling valuables, he's integrity in his
        family plummeted. Now is Sang-tae's turn to take revenge
