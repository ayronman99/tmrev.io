        >The adventure begins with the crash of a meteor in the outskirts of a
        desert city. The space-rock contains a chemical substance that affects
        the residents in peculiar ways. Two neighboring preteens fall in love, a
        nerd schoolgirl creates powerful energy with pressure cooker, a young
        boy takes his dad's cab out to make money and a schoolboy organizes for
        Hajj, when they are all exposed to the substance. As a result, their
        parents along with the whole neighborhood go wild in the ensuing events.
        Ironically, the kids and the adults switch places while trying to figure
        out a solution to this "otherworldly" problem!</image:caption
