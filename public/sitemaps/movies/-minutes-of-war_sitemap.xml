        >February 1976. Somalian rebels hijack a school bus carrying 21 French
        children and their teacher in Djibouti City. When the terrorists drive
        it to a no-manâ€™s-land on the border between Somalia and French
        territory, the French Government sends out a newly formed elite squad to
        rescue the hostages. Within a few hours, the highly trained team arrives
        to the crisis area, where the Somalian National Army has taken position
        behind the barbed wire on the border. The French unit is left with very
        few options to rescue the hostages. As the volatile situation unravels,
        the French men quickly come up with a daring plan: carry out a
        simultaneous 5 men sniper attack to get the children and the teacher out
        safely. A true story.</image:caption
