        >Based on the best selling autobiography by Irish expat Frank McCourt,
        Angela's Ashes follows the experiences of young Frankie and his family
        as they try against all odds to escape the poverty endemic in the slums
        of pre-war Limerick. The film opens with the family in Brooklyn, but
        following the death of one of Frankie's siblings, they return home, only
        to find the situation there even worse. Prejudice against Frankie's
        Northern Irish father makes his search for employment in the Republic
        difficult despite his having fought for the IRA, and when he does find
        money, he spends the money on drink.</image:caption
