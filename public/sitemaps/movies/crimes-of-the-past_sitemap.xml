        >After Tommy Sparrow is severely wounded in a covert CIA operation, he
        comes home to discover his wife with another man. Tommy’s rage and
        wounds frighten his seven-year-old daughter Josephine. When Tommy’s wife
        tells him to leave and never come home, Tommy disappears back into the
        CIA, employing his skills as a spy to covertly watch his only daughter
        grow up.Twenty-five years later, Tommy Sparrow finally comes in from the
        cold – to retirement. Josephine is battling her own destructive nature
        and the damage done by the disappearance of her father. Tommy carries
        his scars both inside and out – and while his cold war operations never
        seem far behind, Tommy’s journey home will surpass any mission he ran
        with the Agency – because reuniting with Josephine and becoming her
        father may cost him his life.</image:caption
