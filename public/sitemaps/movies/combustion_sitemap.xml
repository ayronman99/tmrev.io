        >Millwood City engineer Scott Daniels, moved from Houston, investigates
        a series of mysterious fires. Scott's and Lourie Harper's only son
        Jesse, who hated the move or dad's youth home, fakes a fever and invites
        his new girlfriend Carmen. She's reporter Allison Saunders, Scott's
        high-school ex's, daughter and finds Jesse unconscious, overtaken by
        fumes. The sewers are full of dead rats. Cracks appear in various
        buildings. Gass leaks start explosive fires. Mayor Walker, who only care
        for politics and publicity, overrules Scott's call for a mass
        evacuation. Scott and city administration friend Kenny Barrows later
        discover the link is steam pressure drilling by Talbot's oil exploration
        firm, but fire chief Patterson is in league with Talbot for years,
        covers their tracks and undermines Scott's credibility. Written by KGF
