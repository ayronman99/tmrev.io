        >A fictional process. An amorous relationship in the process of falling
        apart? A semblance of narrative, a sketch of diegesis, the fragments of
        an encounter between a man and a woman: an 'encounter of the crossing',
        marked by return, splitting, distance. Indecisive attitudes suddenly
        suspended or contradictory, toneless voices. Figures, and not
        characters. The figure is this form that approaches and frees itself
        from the notion of character, which reduces presence to a borderline
        state and ruins representation. The figure strays from the real. This
        obliteration and ambiguity of the figure signal the vagueness of the
        subject, the loss of its unity, a relationship to the world of order and
        enigma. The figure as a simple appearance, a mental
        projection.</image:caption
