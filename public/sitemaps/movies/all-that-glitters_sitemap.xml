        >Best friends Ely and Lila share everything together, including their
        dream of a life beyond the Paris suburb they've lived in since
        childhood. One night they venture into the capital and meet a pair of
        wealthy young friends at a night club. Ashamed of their working-class
        background, and seeing an opportunity to escape, Ely and Lila begin to
        lie their way into this glamorous new world. Falling deeper into their
        web of lies, the young women begin to lose sight of themselves as their
        friendship is pushed to the limit.</image:caption
