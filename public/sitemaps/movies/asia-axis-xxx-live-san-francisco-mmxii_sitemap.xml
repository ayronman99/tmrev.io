        >Recorded on November 7th 2012 at the Regency Ballroom in San Francisco,
        this new ASIA live CD / DVD and Blu Ray captures once again the band, in
        the original line-up, in front of an ecstatic audience during one of the
        shows that ASIA performed in support of the "XXX" album and which was
        broadcasted by AXS TV in the USA. With HD recording this new live album
        is truly a rewarding experience for all ASIA fans. After the recent DVD
        releases, this is Asia performing one of the very last shows featuring
        the original line up with: Geoff Downes, Steve Howe, Carl Palmer and
        John Wetton live on the road, in-your face and for your viewing
        pleasure. The reunion came to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the
        band, but morphed itself into an ongoing endeavour.</image:caption
