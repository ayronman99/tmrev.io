        >As over 6,000 immaculately dressed military re-enactors, men and women,
        gather for the 200th anniversary of the epic Battle of Waterloo, some of
        them representing real individuals from the time, whether ‘humble
        foot-soldiers’, ‘officers’ or the great ‘Marshal Ney.’ who is
        unfortunately less adapt at horsemanship than the original, the real
        battle is taking place elsewhere: American Mark Schneider, considered
        the best Napoleon in the business, vs. Frenchman Frank Samson,
        uniform-maker extraordinaire, as to who will be Emperor on the day.
        There was only one Napoleon, there can be only one Napoleon, but the
        Belgians are in charge, unrest is growing in the ranks, there is an
        outstanding prison sentence to be served, an unpaid bill for parking to
        which the ‘Empress Josephine’ also has something to say, and as to who
        meets their Waterloo first, you’ll just have to watch.</image:caption
