        >Based on a true story. Two fighters of 'Donbas' Volunteer Battalion get
        locked inside city of Ilovaysk after regular Russian army enters Ukraine
        and shells the surrounded divisions of Ukrainian Army in the infamous
        would-be 'green corridor'. The fighters survive thanks to the help of
        the locals and manage to break out through the front line to reach the
        freed territory. Taras Kostanchuk who is playing himself as 'Beshoot' is
        that same Donbas commander who is the prototype of the story. Half of
        the actors and extras are real 'Donbas' volunteers who survived the
        battle.</image:caption
