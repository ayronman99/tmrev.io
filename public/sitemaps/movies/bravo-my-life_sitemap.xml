        >As his sexual awareness increases, Gwang-ho no longer likes the scent
        of his mother, who wears heavy make-up as she sells cosmetics
        door-to-door. Eun-sook, an assistant nurse who is the complete opposite
        of Gwang-ho's mother, becomes the object of all of Gwang-ho's attention
        and affection. Absorbed in his thoughts, Gwang-ho is oblivious of the
        news of the presidents death and the picture of the new president
        replacing the late president in his classroom. Gwang-ho receives a
        letter of luck and starts sending it to people around him. As those
        people start vanishing, Gwang-ho is racked with guilt, suspecting the
        letter of luck is the cause of their disappearance.</image:caption
