        >The film follows Ibro (Emir Hadžihafizbegović) and his son Armin (Armin
        Omerović), who travel from a small town in Bosnia to a film audition in
        Zagreb, hoping to land a part for Armin in a German film about the war
        in Bosnia. On their way to fulfilling the boy's dream, they encounter a
        series of disappointing setbacks — their bus to Zagreb breaks down and
        they are late for the audition. After Ibro convinces the director to
        give the boy a second chance, they soon realize that Armin is too old
        for the part anyway. As it becomes obvious that Armin's dream of playing
        a part in the movie will never happen, he feels increasingly
        disheartened, while Ibro's determination to help his son grows. Finally
        they do get another chance, but Armin buckles under the pressure and
        experiences an epileptic seizure. As they get ready to head back to
        Bosnia, the film crew makes an unexpected offer, but when Ibro refuses,
        Armin at last realizes how much his father really loves
        him.</image:caption
