        >When compulsive gambler Sir Giles Staverley has lost his estate and all
        his money playing dice, he realises that he only has one thing left of
        value: his daughter Serena. In a final game, he stakes his daughter's
        hand in marriage, convinced that this time he will not lose.
        Unfortunately, however, he does lose; to the evil Lord Wrotham. Unable
        to return home and tell his daughter that he has lost her in a game of
        dice, Sir Giles kills himself there and then. Lord Vulcan, who has
        witnessed the events, takes pity on Serena Staverley, although they have
        never met. He challenges Lord Wrotham to a game of dice in which the
        winner takes both Staverley Court and Miss Serena.</image:caption
