        >2AM, closing time: A cocky bar manager with a shady past and a young
        handsome bartender discover a beautiful woman bloodied and unconscious
        in the bathroom of a late night lounge. When she awakens, Tony, Matt and

        role playing in an ever-escalating game of cat and mouse that forces
        them to face the dark shadows of themselves. As we begin to piece
        together the elaborate puzzle, nothing is what it seems. However, one
        thing is for certain: this Rose is full of thorns.</image:caption
