        >The tale begins when Dr. Suzana, under the supervision of Prof. Dr.
        Taib Siron, created a machine named BS21 which is capable of reading
        people's minds. The machine would be very much useful for millitary use
        but would be very deadly if it were to fall in the wrong hands. The most
        feared incident happened when Cat and his sidekick Kupan stole BS21 from
        Dr. Suzana's lab. One of the eyewitness who saw the incident was Hashim
        a security guard at the lab. Another thing that they don't know about
        the machine is that it is also capable of granting wishes those who use
        the machine.</image:caption
