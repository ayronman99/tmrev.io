        >Sebastian James is a courier by day and DJ by night. When he fails to
        deliver an important package for his boss, public relations guru Julian
        Gold, Seb finds himself an unwitting participant in an economic
        power-play with a Saudi Prince as the Saudi government attempts to
        divest from the US dollar. As Seb begins to fall for the Princeâ€™s
        daughter, his friends are dragged into the conflict. Throughout his
        struggle, the dark powers that operate in Washington, DC (modern-day
        Babylon) are revealed, and the Achilles heel of the US Empire is
        exposed.</image:caption
