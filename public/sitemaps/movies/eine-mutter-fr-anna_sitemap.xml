        >Klaus Berger is a committed journalist who reports to the local
        department of the Erfurt daily newspaper. Since the death of his wife,
        Klaus alone is taking care of his eleven-year-old daughter Anna, so that
        he has his hands full with his job and child care. He does not have
        enough time for Anna. A woman who could take something away from him is
        missing in his life. But when Klaus falls in love with the attractive
        lawyer Judith Wagner, there is a not small problem: Anna can not stand
        the self-confident lawyer. The tide turns when the two "women" come
        closer thanks to their shared passion for sailing.</image:caption
