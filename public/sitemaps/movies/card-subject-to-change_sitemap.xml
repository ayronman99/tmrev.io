        >CARD SUBJECT TO CHANGE: PRO WRESTLING'S UNDERGROUND takes you deep
        inside the underground world of professional wrestling. This compelling
        film follows several wrestlers as they make their way through the local
        VFW halls, high school gyms and Elks' lodges grinding it out on the
        independent circuit where the payouts can range from $5 - $20 per match.
        Some do it for the love of the sport, others desperate to make it big;
        it is both heart-pounding and heart-wrenching. Tim Disbrow makes his
        directorial debut as he documents the circuit's legends, including:
        Kevin Sullivan, Michael "Trent Acid" Verdi, Rhett Titus, Sabu, Kamala
        and Necro Butcher, who also made an appearance in the
        critically-acclaimed film, The Wrestler.</image:caption
