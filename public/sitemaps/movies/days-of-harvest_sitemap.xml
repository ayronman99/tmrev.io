        >17-year-old Elia is spending the summer harvesting grapes on his
        parent's farm. Bored and a little lonely, his life is thrown into
        turmoil when the beautiful and experienced Emilia comes to help with the
        harvest. His father, Claudio is a staunch Communist and his life too is
        turned upside down when the popular party leader dies. Maddalena, the
        mother, continues stoically through it all, secure in her Catholic faith
        and the prayer meetings she runs. As Emilia becomes more involved in
        Elia's life he opens up to her about the frustrations and joys of rural
        teenage life.</image:caption
