        >Kaori and Natsumi go to the same university. They met for the first
        time after learning they had the same boyfriend. Their boyfriend, Naoki,
        was a gangster. He blackmailed Kaori with a sex video and forced her to
        help him with credit card fraud, while tempting Natsumi with sweet words
        at the beach aiming for the landing patent of Natsumi's mother's
        apartment. Kaori and Natsumi were upset that they were tricked and
        conspired to kill Naoki. They developed a strange friendship as they
        dismembered Naoki's body. Kaori and Natsumi went by car to the sea where
        they planned to scatter the remaining bones. But Kondo and other yakuza
        learned what they did and chased after them. What is the ending of the
        escape for life and death, love and friendship?</image:caption
