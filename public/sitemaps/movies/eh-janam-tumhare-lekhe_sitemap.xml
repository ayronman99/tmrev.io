        >Eh Janam Tumhare Lekhe ~ This life is dedicated to "YOU THE ALMIGHTY"
        (God). This film is a journey of one man "BHAGAT PURAN SINGH" who
        treaded a difficult and exhausting path. The journey was made possible
        by his infinite faith in his mission: the moral values he received from
        his mother: and courage, vision and determination he received from Guru
        Granth Sahib. With compassion in his heart he found energy that can move
        mountains and create miracles. The film is an important chapter in the
        history of post - partition Punjab.</image:caption
