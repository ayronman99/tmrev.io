        >Jean-François Davy is a legendary French director of erotic cinema,
        whose work was among the most notable European adult film productions of
        the 1970s and 80s, particularly his documentaries on Parisian sexuality
        including Prostitution (1975), Les Pornocrates (1976), and the trilogy
        of Exhibition (1975), Exhibition 2 (1978), and Exhibition 79 (1979).
        After an absence of several years, Davy now returns to the erotic
        documentary genre that made him famous, only now he turns his probing
        camera on himself as well. Davy and his cameraman travel to the major
        cities of Eastern Europe – from Prague to Budapest, with stops in
        between – as the filmmaker searches for a beautiful muse to serve as the
        leading lady of his next carnal opus. As countless gorgeous young women
        undress to audition for the camera, Davy keeps looking for a girl with a
        special quality, and when he finds her, he also finds himself falling
        head over heels for her charms.</image:caption
