        >On the brink of the 2007 U.S. troop surge, two Army Recruiters face the
        daunting pressures of recruitment while their own deployment is on the
        line. Sgt. Harris (Lew Temple) has been stationed in the recruiting
        office long enough for it to feel like home. On the other side of the
        world, a roadside bomb rips through a Humvee, and after recovering from
        the attack, Sgt. Mason (Clayne Crawford) gets reassigned and winds up in
        Harris's office. Mason wants to go back to the front lines, but he finds
        out that the war isn't confined to the battlefield.</image:caption
