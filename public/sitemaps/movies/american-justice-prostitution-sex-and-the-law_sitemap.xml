        >"The oldest profession in the world" shows no signs of slowing down
        today. But in the age of AIDS the nature of the business has changed,
        and sex for pay is taking on many new, semi-legal guises. AMERICAN
        JUSTICE takes an unflinching look at the state of prostitution in
        America today, from high-class call girls to the traditional
        streetwalker. See footage of actual busts, and discover how the emphasis
        has shifted to include the "John" as well as the prostitute.
        Prostitution experts reveal the little-known facts of the criminal
        sex-for-pay industry, including the "networks" that ensure there are
        always fresh prostitutes hitting the streets, often runaways lured by
        false promises and held captive by vicious pimps. And in exclusive
        interviews, the women, the Johns and the police tell their tales of SEX
        AND THE LAW.</image:caption
