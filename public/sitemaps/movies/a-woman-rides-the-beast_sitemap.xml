        >MOST "end times" discussions focus on the coming Antichristâ€”but he is
        only half the story. MANY are surprised to discover that in Revelation
        17, there is another mysterious character at the heart of prophecy; a
        woman who rides the beast. TRADITION says this "mystery" woman is
        connected with the church of Rome. But isn't such a view outdated? After
        all, today's Vatican is eager to join hands with evangelicals and all
        religions worldwide. BIBLICAL truth and global events present a
        well-defined portrait of the woman and her powerful place in the
        Antichrist's future empire. MORE THAN TEN remarkable clues in Revelation
        17 and 18 prove the woman's identity beyond any reasonable doubt. Watch
        and be amazed!</image:caption
