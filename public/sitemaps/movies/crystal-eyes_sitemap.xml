        >Buenos Aires, 1985. It's the first anniversary of the death of Alexis
        Carpenter, the unstable supermodel who died tragically when she was set
        on fire while closing a runaway show. Lucia L'uccello - Editor-in-Chief
        of the most important magazine in Buenos Aires - chooses supermodels Eva
        Lantier and Irene del Lago to honor Alexis on the cover of the
        anniversary issues dedicated to the famous model. The night before the
        photo shoot, Alexis's original dresses that were going to be used by the
        models are stolen. From that moment, members of the important fashion
        magazine and the agency begin to disappear, one by one, at the hands of
        a stealthy, sinister female silhouette in a long black leather raincoat.
        Is someone seeking revenge? Or has Alexis returned from the
        grave?</image:caption
