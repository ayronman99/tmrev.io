        >Amy Newhouse must now fight the biggest battle of her life - cancer.
        Her open heart to the people of her school now sparks a passionate rally
        from the community. However, this passion dwindles as her cancer
        metastasizes. Her cancer seems to miraculously disappear, but just as it
        seems the community has prevailed and the battle won, Amy discovers that
        the deadly disease has returned and is incurable. Amy's prayers for
        healing continue, but with the seemingly dried-up support of her
        community, and an apparent "no" from God, she dies from the one battle
        she cannot win. However, with her death comes life and redemption of
        Pampa High, as her club grows exponentially, redeeming the school of the
        once-rampant violence, drugs, and alcohol that she so passionately
        fought against, and proving to all doubters that God has a "Greater Yes"
        after all. Written by Anonymous</image:caption
