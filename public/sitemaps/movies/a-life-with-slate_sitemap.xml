        >Alampu is a beautiful and exceedingly remote village in Nepal. The
        majority of the settlers there are Thami people, one of the indigenous
        groups of Nepal. More than 90 percent of them have been involved in the
        slate production at Alampu. This film includes technical details about
        slate production in the mountainside mine, and how the slate is worked
        prior to distribution. In the film we see the social relationships,
        co-operation between the miners, and the intimacy of the mining
        families. Strong women perform the tough and arduous work alongside the
        men. They have to carry heavy slate loads far to sell them. The film
        also describes the socio-cultural life of the village and its
        interaction with the environment. The activities of the men and women in
        the mine, as well as in the village, have an almost poetic
        dimension.</image:caption
