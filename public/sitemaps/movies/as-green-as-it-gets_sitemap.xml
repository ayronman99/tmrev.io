        >Georg "Schorsch" Kempter is a gardener in a small Bavarian town,
        working day-in, day-out in his nursery, which is facing bankruptcy. He
        doesn't like to talk much. He never has. His marriage has long lost all
        its magic and on top of that, he has trouble to connect with his
        daughter. Only when he is flying in his own rickety biplane, Schorsch
        feels truly free. When the owner of the local golf course tries to cheat
        Schorsch for his money, claiming the shade of green of the grass
        Schorsch has planted on the golf course is not right, insolvency seems
        unavoidable. So just when his airplane is about to be impounded,
        Schorsch grabs the control stick and flies away in an attempt to save
        his plane and himself. He embarks onto a journey into the unknown, to
        places he has never seen before, full of odd and special encounters -
        and with every take-off and every landing, this tough man's heart slowly
        warms up to what you might call an idea of happiness.</image:caption
