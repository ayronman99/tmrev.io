        >In October 2014, Kentucky hard rockers Black Stone Cherry brought their
        'Magic Mountain' tour to Europe taking in shows in Scandinavia, Germany,
        France, Switzerland, Italy, Austria, Belgium, Ireland and the UK. This
        show from Birmingham's LG Arena was filmed on October 30th. The setlist
        features tracks from all four of their albums and includes all of their
        best known songs. Black Stone Cherry continue the long tradition of
        Southern Rock bands being great concert performers and have built a real
        affinity with their European fans in particular. Here in Birmingham they
        once again deliver a scorching live show.</image:caption
