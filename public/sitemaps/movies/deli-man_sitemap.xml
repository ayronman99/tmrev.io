        >Every story needs a brave and trustworthy guide, and Deli Man’s is the
        effusive and charming Ziggy Gruber, a third-generation delicatessen man
        - his uncle and great-uncle owned Berger’s in the diamond district, and
        the Woodrow Deli on Long Island. His grandfather owned the famous Rialto
        Delicatessen on Broadway, and Ziggy was stuffing cabbages atop of a
        crate when he was eight. Now he is owner and maven (as well as a
        Yiddish-speaking French trained chef) of one of the country’s top delis,
        Kenny and Ziggy’s in Houston – yes, Texas…Shalom y’all. Of course the
        story of deli isn’t Ziggy’s alone. Deli Man has visited meccas like the
        Carnegie, Katz’s, 2nd Avenue Deli, Nate ‘n Al, and Canter’s, as well as
        interviewed some of the great connoisseurs of deli, including Jerry
        Stiller, Alan Dershowitz, Freddie Klein, Dennis Howard, Jay Parker
        (Ben’s Best), Fyvush Finkel, and Larry King. -
