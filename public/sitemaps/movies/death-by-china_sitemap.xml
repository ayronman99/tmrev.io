        >In 2001, China joined the World Trade Organization with the strong
        support of a Democratic President and Republican Congress. Before the
        ink was dry on this free trade agreement, China began flooding U.S.
        markets with illegally subsidized exports while the big multinational
        companies that had lobbied heavily for the agreement rapidly accelerated
        the off shoring of American jobs to China. Today, as a result of the
        biggest shell game in American history, China has stolen millions of our
        jobs, corporate profits are soaring, and we now owe over $3 trillion to
        the world's largest totalitarian nation. This film is about how that
        happened... and why the best jobs program for America is trade reform
        with China.</image:caption
