        >It's not easy being a teenager and Mike, a sixteen-year-old, has it
        espcially hard. He lives in the sticks with his mother, a non-stop
        nagger, in Faintville, a Canadian timber industry town. He has no
        father, no friends, not even a favorite meal. Basically, his sole wish
        is simply to vanish from the face of the earth. One day, Mike writes his
        own obituary and shoots himself. To his great disappointment he wakes up
        the in the local hospital. During a routine examination, the doctors
        discover a plum-sized tumor in his brain. Mike can scarcely believe his
        luck and keeps the illness to himself to avoid undergoing surgery that
        would save him. Staring death directly in the eyes, however, changes
        Mike's point of view and he re-evaluates his opinion of both enchanting
        and crazy Miranda. Somebody seems to understand him after
        all.</image:caption
