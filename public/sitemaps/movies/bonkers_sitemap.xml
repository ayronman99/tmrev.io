        >Bonnie, a nine-year-old single child, is part of a family of three
        living in the Netherlands. They have a love of elephants, passed on by
        Bonnie's grandfather's grandfather who worked on a game reserve in
        Africa, and Bonnie feels that she instinctively does things like an
        elephant as a result. Her single mother, Lis, is bi-polar and at times
        spends days on end without even getting out of bed. Then there are other
        times when she will manically do wild acts, such as impromptu dancing in
        public. As a result, Bonnie's sturdy and stable grandmother must hold
        the family together by doing all the cooking, etc. After her grandmother
        is killed by a car, Bonnie becomes the most responsible family member
        and struggles with preparing meals and getting her reluctant mother to
        take her medication. She also must dodge Jorien, a social worker who is
        attempting to place her in a foster home.</image:caption
