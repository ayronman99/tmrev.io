        >The true story of Charlotte Salomon, a young German-Jewish painter who
        comes of age in Berlin on the eve of the Second World War. Fiercely
        imaginative and deeply gifted, she dreams of becoming an artist. Her
        first love applauds her talent, which emboldens her resolve. When
        anti-Semitic policies inspire violent mobs, she escapes to the safety of
        the South of France. There she begins to paint again, and finds new
        love. But her work is interrupted, this time by a family tragedy that
        reveals an even darker secret. Believing that only an extraordinary act
        will save her, she embarks on the monumental adventure of painting her
        life story.</image:caption
