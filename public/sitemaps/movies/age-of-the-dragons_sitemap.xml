        >Age of the Dragons is an adaptation of Herman Melville's classic novel
        Moby Dick. Set in a medieval realm where Captain Ahab and crew hunt
        dragons for the vitriol that powers their world, Ishmael, a charismatic
        harpooner and his friend Queequeg join their quest. Ahab's adopted
        daughter Rachel, beautiful and tough, runs the hunting vessel. Ahab's
        obsession to seek revenge on a great White Dragon that slaughtered his
        family when he was young and left his body scarred and mauled, drives
        the crew deeper into the heart of darkness. In the White Dragon's lair
        Ahab's secrets are revealed and Rachel must choose between following him
        on his dark quest or escaping to a new life with Ishmael.</image:caption
