        >After months of living a solitary existence, Lenny, 34, picks up his
        kids from school. Every year he spends a couple of weeks with his sons
        Sage, 9, and Frey, 7. Lenny hosts his kids within a midtown studio
        apartment in New York. During these two weeks, he must figure out if he
        wants to act as their father or be their friend. Ultimately, their trip
        upstate results in complete lawlessness taking over their
        lives.</image:caption
