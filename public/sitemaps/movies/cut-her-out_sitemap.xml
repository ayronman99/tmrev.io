        >Plagued by nightmares and obsessive sleepwalking, Darcy Baker can't
        purge her mind of the animalistic abuse she suffered as a child at the
        hands of her mother. When Darcy's therapist Ryan is informed that her
        family homestead, the very source of her nightmares, has been abandoned,
        he is eager to get her back there and pull the suppressed memories to
        the surface in order to start her journey of healing. While Darcy has no
        interest in walking through the door to that hell, she does have a deep
        desire to win the love of Ryan and succumbs to his wishes to return to
        her childhood home. Upon arriving at the decrepit house, she and Ryan
        discover that the fear mother ignites in Darcy still lives. Even more
        unsettling, they uncover the existence of ten-year-old Sam, a feral
        mute, who keeps his secrets dangerously close to his heart. Ryan
        admirably risks it all to heal both Sam and Darcy, but is their blood
        bond thicker than the healing waters he has to offer?</image:caption
