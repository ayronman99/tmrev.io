        >Anna is 60 and her acting heyday is now behind her. She lives on her
        own but has a friend and confidant in her downstairs neighbour Michel,
        who is also single. Reluctantly, Anna accepts a job as a language coach
        for 17-year-old Adrian who has a speech impediment and is something of a
        misfit. She recognises him as the boy who recently snatched her handbag
