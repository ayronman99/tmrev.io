        >Bots High is an exciting documentary following the adventures of three
        high school robotics teams battling for first place at a national
        robotics competition in Miami, Florida. It's a no-holds-barred fight to
        the death with robot carnage everywhere you look. Genius inventor Will
        builds robots so powerful they're unstoppable...if only they don't
        destroy themselves first. The Mechanical Misfits are an all girls team
        stumbling through their first foray into combat robotics and Elizabeth
        and Danielle are a formidable pair looking to reign supreme during their
        last year of high school. Bots High follows these students as they
        design, build and compete at Nationals - all while surviving high
        school, first love and teenager procrastination. A FilmBuff
        Presentation.</image:caption
