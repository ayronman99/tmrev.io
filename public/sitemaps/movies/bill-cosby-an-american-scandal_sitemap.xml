        >A biography of Bill Cosby from young adult to his adult career in the
        spotlight, his relationships, and evidence of a decades-long propensity
        for his (alleged) use of drugs to get what he wants. How his success
        brought access to "A-list" celebrities and the places they congregate,
        including the Playboy Mansion. That his young wife gave an interview to
        Ebony Magazine revealing that the relationship wasn't all it should be
        and that Cosby was "temperamental." Without saying more, this
        documentary is well worth watching, coming on at a time when the jury
        for his criminal trial in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is
        deadlocked.</image:caption
