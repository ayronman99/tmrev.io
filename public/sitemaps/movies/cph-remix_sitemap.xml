        >Copenhagen is a small, but famous capital in Europe. It's known for
        Tivoli, the Little Mermaid, the Royal Family etc. But Copenhagen also
        has a very different visual part. Everywhere around the city
        street-artists are adding their stories, emotions and expressions on the
        walls and tunnels. Copenhagen Remix is shot during the biggest
        "fairytale" event during the last four decades in Denmark: The royal
        wedding between Crown Prince Frederik and his Australian fianc√©e, Mary
        Donaldson. While the city is dressing up for the royal event, two local
        artists are working intensely in the streets with their arts. Meanwhile
        a desperate graffiti remover from the city council is trying to clean up
        the "mess" before the giant event.</image:caption
