        >Kavich Neang’s first film is a short documentary following Sory Chan, a
        14-year-old boy who is living in Phnom Penh apart from his family. A
        student of Cambodian classical music, Sory lives with his mother’s
        friend after his mother fled a debt she couldn’t afford to pay back.
        Each evening after class, he carries a scale outside in a popular part
        of the city and asks people to weigh themselves for a small amount of
        money. In this urgent film, we witness Sory’s day in class, his nightly
        routine and a particularly difficult conversation with his mother who he
        meets on the street.</image:caption
