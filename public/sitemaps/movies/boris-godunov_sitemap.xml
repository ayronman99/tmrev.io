        The picture opens from the scene of the murder in Uglich of a young heir
        to the Russian throne by unknown people. It takes several years. Boris
        Godunov is persuaded to take the throne remaining vacant, despite his
        doubts. During the press conference, the Duma clerk announces Godunov’s
        decision to ascend the kingdom. People are discussing this decision at
        the TV. Behind the tsar’s back there is a secret undercover fight of
        several boyar groups for domination under the new government. Godunov,
        who ascended the throne, obsessively pursues a vision of the boy he
        killed. Meanwhile, the monk Grigory Otrepyev is hiding in the Miracle
        Monastery. After talking with Pimen, he learns the secret of the murder,
        flees from the monastery and decides to try to come to power. Having
        secured foreign help and gathered an army, Grigory goes to
        Moscow.</image:caption
