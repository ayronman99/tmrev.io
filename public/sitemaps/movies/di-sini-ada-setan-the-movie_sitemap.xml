        >Based on information read on the internet, Choky invites his girlfriend
        to visit a lake. Legend has it that any couple who goes to that lake
        will have a long-lasting relationship. His sister, Lola, who has just
        broken up with her boyfriend, is told by her mother to join her brother.
        Choky's friends also join in. On their way to the lake, the car breaks
        down in the forest. Then Lola goes missing and the fun vacation turns
        into a nightmare.</image:caption
