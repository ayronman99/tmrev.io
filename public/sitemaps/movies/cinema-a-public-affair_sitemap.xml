        >A cineastic journey into the world of Naum Kleiman, one of the most
        important intellectuals in Russia today. Naum Kleiman, an
        internationally acclaimed Eisenstein specialist, is the director of the
        „Musey Kino“, Moscow’s museum of cinema. Since 1989, the „Musey Kino“,
        has shown previously banned classics of world cinema and Soviet films.
        Many saw the „Musey Kino“, as Moscow ́s most important intellectual
        forum. In 2005, the Moscow municipality sold the „Musey Kino’s“ building
        and it became homeless. In October 2014, the Russian Minister of Culture
        fired Naum Kleiman as director. In protest, his entire team handed in
        their resignations. Scenes from iconic movies and interviews with
        Muscovites of different ages and social backgrounds form a documentary
        film collage which mirrors Russian reality today.</image:caption
