        relived two bureaucrats in Moldova: the First Secretary and the Second
        Secretary of the Communist party. The Second Secretary was more
        important than the First Secretary, since he had befriended the Tsar of
        the whole Soviet Union - Leonid Brezhnev. The Moldovan Republic is

        musician, finally gets up the nerve to ask the local gypsy Baron for his
        daughters hand in marriage. To everyone surprise, the baron gives the
        couple his blessing, but on one condition: that Lautar acquire
        Brezhnev's personal limousine as a gift for the bride, and that Brezhnev
        come to the wedding</image:caption
