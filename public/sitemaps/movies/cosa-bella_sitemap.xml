        >A young married woman's life takes a radical turn when, what she thinks
        is a passing sexual encounter with her beautiful college roommate, turns
        into a life altering love affair. Friends with privileges? Best friends
        and intimates? Delphine, French, sexy, capricious and married, is still
        in love with her best friend from college, Belle, a beautiful and
        successful interior designer in New York City. Conducting a clandestine
        relationship for years, Belle ends it, but meets great resistance from
        Delphine who is used to "having it all." Sexy, passionate and heartfelt,
        the two lovers meet one last time for a last rendezvous. One last
        reunion turns into a three way of broken hearts. Delphine's husband
        realizes he is up against a serious competitor for his young wife's
        heart, and Delphine must make a grown up decision.</image:caption
