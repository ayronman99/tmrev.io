        >This is the story of Vicente, a successful, married, economist with a
        nine-year-old son. It also tells the story of Antônio, the same man,
        living as a hugadores—one of the homeless, trash scavengers who live and
        work in Brazil’s enormous garbage dumps. Vicente seems to have it all,
        but as we watch his life begins to crumble little by little. Meanwhile,
        Antônio, already at rock bottom, struggles to rebuild his
        life.</image:caption
