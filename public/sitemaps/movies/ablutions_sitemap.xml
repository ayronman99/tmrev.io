        >This diptych opens with the image of two parallel streams of falling
        water. A female torso moves into the background of the left screen while
        a male torso mirrors her on the right. Both figures move slowly to the
        foreground and into the light, cupping and bathing their hands in the
        water for several minutes until they fade away into silhouettes. Viola
        has described this work as a kind of purification ceremony akin to those
        one would experience in a Japanese Zen temple.</image:caption
