        >Having co-written and starred in the hilarious Channel 4 series Phoenix
        Nights with Peter Kay, Dave Spikey is best known for his role as the
        clubâ€™s long-suffering compere, Jerry "The Saint" St. Clair. Also a
        comedian, actor, writer and presenter, Dave is a British comedy award
        winner, having previously won the prestigious Perrier Award at the
        Edinburgh Fringe Festival and the title of North-West Comedian of the
        Year. Filmed in front of a live audience at the Leeds Music Varieties
        Theatre, Dave keeps the audience in hysterics with his down-to-earth
        observations about everything from the difference between Northerners
        and Southerners to memory loss, fashion for old men, badly written
        obituaries and ducks doing cabaret!</image:caption
