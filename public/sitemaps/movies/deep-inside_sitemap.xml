        >In Deep Inside, Camille Henrot's first film, a pornographic film is
        transformed into a voyeuristic, lovelorn ballad. Drawn frame by frame on
        the 35mm film stock of a 70s pornographic film, the sexual content is
        partially revealed and partially hidden by black animated forms that
        seem to be fugitive memories of an old love. The music is slow and
        harrowing like a howl for love. The artist works with marker as one
        might use a stencil, revealing part of the original film in the
        drawing's negative space. By combining pornographic and sentimental
        expression, the film posits that emotional misery is also physical.
        Sexual excitation and heartache are both based on an alternation of
        empty and full, presence and absence, hidden and revealed things. This
        manipulated film creates ambiguous images where scopophilia is no longer
        based on tactile frustration.</image:caption
