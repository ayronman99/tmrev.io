        >The film follows the story of a San Francisco Pentecostal minister
        Richard Gazowsky on his quest to shoot a groundbreaking fantasy film
        called Gravity: The Shadow of Joseph (described by him as "Star Wars
        meets The Ten Commandments"). The film follows him and members of his
        church as they go through pre-production and fly to Alberobello, Italy,
        for initial shooting that turns out to be marred with
        difficulties.</image:caption
