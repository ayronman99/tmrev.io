        >Mina has everything going for her, but her world is turned upside down
        when work sends her to her hometown in Tennessee where she must convince
        an old, stubborn restaurant owner to sell his property. There is just
        one problem- the restaurant is now owned by her ex-boyfriend Clay, who
        claims he will never sell. He resists her negotiations every step of the
        way, and all the while sparks fly.</image:caption
