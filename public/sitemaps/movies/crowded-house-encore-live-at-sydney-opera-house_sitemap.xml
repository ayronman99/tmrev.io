        >Twenty years after bidding farewell to 100,000 people lining the Sydney
        Opera House foreshore, Crowded House return with an encore performance
        to celebrate their 30th anniversary and induction into the ARIA Hall of
        Fame. From humble beginnings in Melbourne to chart-topping international
        success following the release of their ground-breaking debut self-titled
        album, Crowded House has remained an Australian cultural institution,
        with over ten million albums sold across the globe. Now, celebrate the
        legendary group with another incredible live event that sees the band
        perform all their biggest hits over a full two-hour show, including
        'Don't Dream It's Over', 'Fall At Your Feet', 'Weather With You',
        'Better Be Home Soon' and many more.</image:caption
