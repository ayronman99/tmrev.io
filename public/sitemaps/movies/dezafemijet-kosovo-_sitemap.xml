        >Kosovo in the spring of 2000. Winter is over but in a meteorological
        sense only. Ruins and pain. The marks of devastation in the sunny
        landscape. Wounds that never heal, the hesitating , vague gestures of a
        new beginning. Paradoxes. In black and white, with the broken images of
        memory imprints in color. Two words: deca and fëmijët , they mean
        children in Serb and Albanian. These expressions have no place in the
        irrational dictionary of war. It is the children though who are the most
        defenseless victims of this war governed by mad hatred. Their suffering
        has become an indelible chapter of the chronicle at the end of the
        century, the dawn of the new millennium. Besarta, Violeta, Edmond and
        Valdrin, Miljana and Jelena are Albanian and Serb children, the film
        tells their story in black and white with color Super 8 images shot by
        the children themselves.</image:caption
