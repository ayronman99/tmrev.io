        >Marita Lorenz, the daughter of a German sea captain, recalls how she
        became the mistress of Fidel Castro in Havana soon after the Cuban
        revolution in 1959. After being six months pregnant with his baby, she
        was drugged and given a near fatal abortion. She was then recruited by
        the CIA and Mafia to assassinate Castro, but she threw away the poison
        pills just before she met Fidel. She then worked for the CIA in Florida
        and, in 1962, had a daughter while she was the mistress of an
        ex-dictator of Venezuela. She later married an FBI agent, by whom she
        had a son, and they spied on UN diplomats in a New York apartment. She
        claimed her spying days were over when she testified, in the 1977
        Kennedy Assassination Inquiry, about her connection to Frank Sturgis and
        Lee Harvey Oswald.</image:caption
