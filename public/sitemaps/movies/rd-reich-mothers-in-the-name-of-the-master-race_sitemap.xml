        >Two beautiful and different girls, Alice and Lisette are 17 years old,
        when forcibly removed from their Alsatian family to cooperate in the war
        effort in Germany. After spending six months in a indoctrination camp,
        they are both sent to a munitions factory where they are tasked to
        perform inhuman works. An explosion erupts, they are suspected of
        sabotage and threatened with being sent to a boot camp. Alice and
        Lisette believe they saved when transferred to a maternity where they
        continue living the hell of war.</image:caption
