        >In hopes of solving a financial crisis at home, Marysol, youngest
        sibling and agronomy student, decides to dabble in the medical cannabis
        growing industry. When she faces its high costs and government
        regulations, she must convince her parents of starting a clandestine
        operation at home while they can meet the legal requirements. The
        dysfunctional family then embarks on an adventure that promises to bring
        them closer as a family. But things get complicated when, due to lack of
        experience, they end up in business with the wrong people. Under the eye
        of the authorities and without realizing, this family will face their
        worst enemy: themselves.</image:caption
