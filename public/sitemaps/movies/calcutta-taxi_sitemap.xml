        >A young Art College student Aditya Chaterji finds his backpack and
        belongings stolen on the day of a political strike called by the
        infamous political party of Calcutta. Meanwhile Bakul Bihari faces the
        opportunity of a lifetime to win big for his glorious though covetous
        efforts to help a poor boy in distress. Cab driver Rasul Ahmed discovers
        a bomb in his backseat at a congested traffic signal in an extremely
        unpredictable and sensitive slum area of Calcutta. Set in the grimy
        backdrop of a city going through a political crisis, Calcutta Taxi
        unravels the story of three lives that coincide and affect each other.
        Each one having lost and found some things in this chance encounter of
        life.</image:caption
