        >In an art studio in Hamburg, a young woman's body is found hanging up.
        A man from a homicide squad has developed new electronic equipment that
        allows him to analyze exactly who the perpetrator was. He moves into the
        studio for a few days to better research and investigate. Completely
        isolated and together with a corpse, he becomes addicted to drugs and
        seems to gradually go insane. And because things have to get even
        harder, he has to deal with the loss of his girlfriend, to whom he was a
        stranger shortly before. The end leads to morbid
        self-knowledge.</image:caption
