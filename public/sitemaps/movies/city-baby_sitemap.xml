        >Sexy. Style-conscious. Extreme love affairs. Complicated friendships.
        Life happens all too quickly when Cloey is reluctantly plucked from her
        comfort zone and complete reliance on others is overturned – a secure
        relationship with her boyfriend unravels, her childhood best friend is
        moving away and daddy’s (Daniel Baldwin) checkbook closes. City Baby
        comments on the ladder-climbing mentality of always reaching for the
        next bigger, better thing – relationship, city, job – when sometimes
        what's right in front of us is just fine. Scattered with cameos from
        Portland musicians like Stephen Malkmus of Pavement, live musical
        performances by Glass Candy and Starfucker, and a thoughtful soundtrack
        featuring all Portland bands and musicians, City Baby depicts a
        playground for semi-adults, revolving through the lives of cool
        kids.</image:caption
