        >"I smell gasoline," the suspicious husband, Matthew, announces in the
        opening scene of "Easter," Will Scheffer's dark and poignant heartland
        drama at Naked Angels. Wilma, his wife, has just returned from town, in
        a wedding dress, no less, and Matthew is worried that she is up to her
