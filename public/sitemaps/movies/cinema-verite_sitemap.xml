        >In 1973, the Loud family became a television sensation of a new kind.
        It was long before a metal rock star showed his eccentric family on the
        small screen and decades before housewives had screaming matches with
        each other on camera in public. CINEMA VERITE tells the
        behind-the-scenes story of the groundbreaking documentary "An American
        Family," which chronicled the lives of the Louds in the early 1970s and
        catapulted the Santa Barbara family to notoriety while creating a new
        television genre: the reality TV series.</image:caption
