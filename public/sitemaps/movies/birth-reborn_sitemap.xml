        >The feature film ' The Birth Reborn' portrays the serious obstetric
        reality in the world, which is characterized by an alarming number of
        cesarean or deliveries with traumatic and unnecessary interventions, as
        opposed to what is known and recommended by science today. This
        situation has serious perinatal, psychological, social, anthropological
        and financial consequences. Through the reports of some of the leading
        experts in the area and the latest scientific discoveries, the film
        questions the current obstetric model, leads to a reflection on the new
        paradigm of the twenty-first century and the future of a civilization
        born without the so-called 'love hormones', released only under specific
        conditions of labor.</image:caption
