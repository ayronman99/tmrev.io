        >11-years-old Blanka survives alone in Manila begging and stealing from
        tourists. One day, an absurd idea pops up: if she could buy a mother,
        she could have a good life. But she has to make countless efforts in
        order to collect enough money. An opportunity arises when she meets
        Peter, a 55 years old blind street musician, who teaches Blanka how to
        sing, a skill out of which she can make money. However, concerned about
        Blankaâ€™s future, Peter decides to take Blanka to an orphanage. When she
        finds out, she runs away and the nightmare starts again.</image:caption
