        >Amerika, Zed and Kyle are good friends until the excitingly
        undermedicated bitch goddess Trasha enters the frame, cutting Kyle off
        from his friends and their vacuous and unencumbered world of beer and
        porn. Amerika and Zed aim to free their friend from the clutches of his
        nutburger girlfriend by enlisting the aid of the Sappho Carpet Cleaners
        for some wet work. The plan goes awry when Trasha and her psychosis find
        themselves a paying gig and tables are turned, trashed and
        burned.</image:caption
