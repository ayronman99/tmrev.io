        >"A Touch of Spice" is a story about Fanis, a young Greek boy growing up
        in Istanbul, whose grandfather, a culinary philosopher and mentor,
        teaches him that both food and life require a little salt to give them
        flavor. They both require... A Touch of Spice. Fanis grows up to become
        an excellent cook and uses his cooking skills to spice up the lives of
        those around him. 35 years later he leaves Athens and travels back to
        his birthplace of Istanbul to reunite with his grandfather and his first
        love. He travels back only to realize that he forgot to put a little bit
        of spice in his own life.</image:caption
