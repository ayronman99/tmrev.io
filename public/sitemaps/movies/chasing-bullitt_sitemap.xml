        >January 1971- After an unexpected confrontation with his agent,
        Hollywood legend Steve McQueen makes a reluctant deal. He'll choose his
        next acting gig on one condition: his agent has to help him locate the
        iconic Ford Mustang GT 390 from his seminal film BULLITT. On his journey
        across the desert and back to Los Angeles, Steve ruminates on his
        triumphs and losses. Through his memories, a picture of the man's
        reality is slowly revealed: a crumbling marriage, therapy, financial
        troubles, and a waning career.</image:caption
