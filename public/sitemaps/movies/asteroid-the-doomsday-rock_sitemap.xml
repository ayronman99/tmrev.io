        >This one hour program tells the story of a team of scientists who
        believe and intend to prove that the world's largest environmental
        disaster, the asteroid, is entirely possible. It shot from a hot white
        sky with absolutely no warning. On Friday, June 14, 2002, an asteroid
        the size of a football field made one of the closest ever recorded
        approaches to Earth. Traveling at more than 10km/second, it brushed past
        Earth completely unseen, at a distance of 120,000km, less than a third
        of the distance to the Moon. Had it hit the Earth it could have
        devastation on a scale similar to that of the asteroid impact in
        Tunguska, Siberia in 1908, when 2000 square km of forest were flattened
        in a matter of seconds. Had that chunk of space debris hit Moscow or
        Hong Kong instead, the loss of life would have been staggering. This one
        hour program tells the story of a multi-national team of scientists who
        believe and intend to prove that the world's largest environmental
        disaster is entirely possible.</image:caption
