        >Brandon Semenuk's Rad Company pushes the limits of free-ride mountain
        biking and showcases the skills and passion that make him one of the
        most versatile and explosive riders on the planet. Brandon handpicked
        the crew of riders for this film who drive and inspire him in each
        discipline, ultimately creating some of the highest level of riding ever
        caught on camera. The film features an eclectic soundtrack that flows
        like your favorite mix tape, while seamlessly meshing all disciplines of
        mountain biking. NWD Films and Red Bull Media House have teamed up with
        some of the top cinematographers and digital effects artists to create
        an innovative style, while keeping true to the “all killer no filler”
        style of the New World Disorder.</image:caption
