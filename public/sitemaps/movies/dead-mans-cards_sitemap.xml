        >Ex Boxer Tom is on the ropes, when a chance encounter at the gym leads
        to the offer of work as a doorman at a run down nightclub. The volatile
        head doorman Paul, is a battle hardened veteran from the old school.
        Recognising Tom for the fighter that he once was, Paul takes him under
        his wing, and guides him through the ins and outs of life as a club land
        "peacekeeper."</image:caption
