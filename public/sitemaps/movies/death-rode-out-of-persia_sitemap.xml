        >Death Rode Out of Persia is the story of a writer who realises after
        three years of heavy drinking that he has to get down to some serious
        work or risk having no money to continue his bingeing. So he starts a
        romantic novel in which the principal character (the writerâ€™s young
        alter ego) must choose between the love of a woman and his addiction to
        cigarettes and alcohol. According to the director, the film "was
        produced on a very small budget, but the friendship between the crew
        allowed them to overcome the initial obstacles.</image:caption
