        >A seeing-eye dog (Shiro) is granted one wish by his former owner. He
        chooses to become a human for a short time so he can find the girl who
        trained him as a puppy. While attempting to get to know her (as he runs
        along behind her and sniffs for her around town) he eventually falls in
        love with her.</image:caption
