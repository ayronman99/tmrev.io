        >The city's biggest crime lords have hatched a plan: Recruit three of
        the best bank robbers and hire them to go on a spree, which includes
        snatching a highly valued gem the bosses can claim for insurance money.
        Each one's working on his own, until they realize they're being played
        against each other. Their counterattack? To band together and run off
        with the loot, beating the mobsters at their own game. Stars Ryan Combs
        and David E. Baker.</image:caption
