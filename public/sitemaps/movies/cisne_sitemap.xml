        >Vera is a singer in her thirties; she is back in Lisbon for the final
        performance of her concert tour. The heat and beauty of Lisbon makes one
        want to be happy. Pablo, the companion she selected from among the many
        who answered her questionnaire, helps her through the sleepless nights.
        He has no family, but wishes he had. Vera concerns herself with the
        mysteries surrounding Pablo's life. Vera is not afraid of the night; she
        is not afraid of anything.</image:caption
