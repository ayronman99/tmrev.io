        >Rom√©o and Juliette are two young actors. They fall in love at first
        sight, move in together and make a baby. A love story and the founding
        of a home like millions of others. Except that their little boy, Adam,
        behaves abnormally. The young parents try hard to persuade themselves
        that everything is okay but, with the passing of time, they cannot
        delude themselves anymore: their son has a problem. From now on, war is
        declared. A war against illness. A war against Death. A war against
        despair.</image:caption
