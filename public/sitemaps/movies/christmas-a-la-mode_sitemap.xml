        >The dairy farm Emily has been running since her father passed away has
        fallen on hard times. When Emilyâ€™s sister, Dorothy, and her handsome
        business partner, Charlie, show up with a proposition to sell the farm,
        Emily comes up with an ingenious plan to buy out her sister's shares.
        She holds an online holiday ice cream flavor contest that goes viral
        with the help of a key ingredient, Charlie's amazing apple pie. Still,
        as the Christmas Eve deadline for the buyout approaches, Emily needs a
        Christmas miracle to save the family farm and her father's
        legacy.</image:caption
