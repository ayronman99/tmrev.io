        >Jeong Hoon broke up with his first love Seo Yeong due to opposition
        from his parents. He has no choice but to marry Mi Na, whom her parents
        introduced, and Seo Yeong commits suicide because she cannot overcome
        the pain of separation. Although a lot of time has passed, Jeong Hoon
        tries to forget Seo Yeong and falls into the illusion that he is living
        with Seo Yeong, who died while struggling. Mi Na, who finds it hard to
        stand Jeong Hoon's behavior, seduces Jae Hee, a courier, to show Jeong
        Hoon, and commits an affair.</image:caption
