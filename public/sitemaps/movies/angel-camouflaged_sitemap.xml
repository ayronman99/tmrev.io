        >This rock and roll drama stars, James Brolin, Carlos Bernard, Tessie
        Santiago, The Marshall Tucker Band, Kurtis Blow, Patty Smyth and the
        rock and roll sensation from South Africa that lit up the screen on
        Rockstar Supernova, Dilana. When rock star sensation, Scottie B., falls
        prey to the demons of fame, she escapes the music scene only to find
        herself face to face with her destiny once again and even greater
        challenges when she inherits a little bar that was once owned by a woman
        with the same spirit and voice of an angel. This exciting rock and roll
        adventure shot was in the desert of California and the low country of
        South Carolina. Angel Camouflaged is the journey of SCOTTIE, a rock and
        roll singer whose struggle with substance abuse causes her music career
        to implode. Scottie bails on her manager/brother, MORGAN, to hide out in
        the Mojave Desert. Her peaceful new life is disturbed when Morgan calls
        and tells her that they inherited a bar in far-off South
        Carolina</image:caption
