        >Star reporter Lars Bogenius is a respected journalist and knows how to
        wow his readers and critics with emotional reportage. Emotional,
        realistic and moving, his style regularly promises to win him the
        industry's most coveted awards. His publishing house is also grateful to
        the exceptional journalist, because the paper's numbers are sinking and
        are being cushioned by Bogenius' reportage, among other things.
        Everything sounds too good to be true - at least that's the opinion of
        freelance journalist Juan Romero, who takes on the inconsistencies and
        looks deeper behind Bogenius' research and reportage. It's a dangerous
        plan that faces numerous obstacles. But what he discovers turns out to
        be the biggest journalism scandal in Germany.</image:caption
