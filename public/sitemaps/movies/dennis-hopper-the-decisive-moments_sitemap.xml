        >The inevitable fat cigar between his fingers, the American actor,
        director and fine artist Dennis Hopper (1936) self-mockingly looks back
        on his chequered life and career, at the request of Dutch director,
        photographer and fine artist Thom Hoffman. The latter sifted through the
        turbulent life story of Hopper, who is primarily known from the cult
        film Easy Rider (1969). Hopper went through as many high as low points.
        In conveniently arranged chapters, Hoffman shows the decisive moments in
        Hopper's life and asks colleagues like Wim Wenders, David Lynch, Sean
        Penn and Julian Schnabel to comment on them. The documentary is richly
        illustrated with film excerpts, photos, newspaper articles and
        anecdotes. The main reason for this film was the retrospective of Dennis
        Hopper's art work in the Amsterdam Stedelijk Museum in
        2001.</image:caption
