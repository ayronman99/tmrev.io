        >Marina is a 37-year-old divorcee who raises her 12-year-old daughter
        alone and works as a teacher at an art school. It seems to Marina that
        her ordinary life is already over until she accidentally meets Nikita.
        The young man falls instantly in love with Marina and will do anything
        to be with her. Marina loves Nikita too but is more than aware of the
        17-year age gap between them. Nikita does not see their difference in
        age as an obstacle and is ready to marry Marina immediately. But Marina
        is afraid for their future and worried that people will disapprove. She
        hesitates and runs back to her hometown where her parents introduce her
        to their new neighbour Igor, a decent and responsible man, who is the
        same age as Marina. He too falls in love with her, and she agrees to
        marry him, but will Nikita let go of the woman he loves so
        easily?</image:caption
