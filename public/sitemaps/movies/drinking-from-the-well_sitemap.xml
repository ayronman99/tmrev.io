        >The real lives of Ugandan youth struggling to create a positive future
        in an environment that tests every ability to survive. Nabulagala, the
        Kampala slum where they live, is populated with broken lives, crumbling
        homes, and bleak prospects. The sunâ€™s heat suppresses emotion. Dust from
        the red clay cakes every surface. Malaria-carrying mosquitoes jab at
        unprotected skin. Homemade alcohol, glue, and other drugs, substances
        that offer a brief reprieve from the misery, have turned people into
        empty shells that occupy the shadows of this slum. Day in and day out,
        the next generation of Ugandans must surmount these obstacles in order
        to begin thinking, dreaming and hoping about the future.</image:caption
