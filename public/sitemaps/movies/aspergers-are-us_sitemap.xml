        >For the members of the comedy troupe Asperger’s Are Us, it’s easier to
        associate with a faceless audience than with their own families. No
        matter who the crowd, best friends Noah, New Michael, Jack and Ethan
        have one simple mantra: “We would much rather the audience appreciate us
        as comedians than people who have overcome adversity.” In this
        coming-of-age heartfelt documentary, this band of brothers finds
        themselves at a crossroad. With real life pulling them apart, they
        decide to plan one ambitious farewell show before they all go their
        separate ways. People with Asperger’s don’t deal well with uncertainty,
        and this is the most uncertain time in their lives.</image:caption
