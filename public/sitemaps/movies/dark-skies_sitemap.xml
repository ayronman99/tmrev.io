        >From the producers of Paranormal Activity, Insidious, and Sinister
        comes Dark Skies: a supernatural thriller that follows a young family
        living in the suburbs. As husband and wife Daniel and Lacey Barret
        witness an escalating series of disturbing events involving their
        family, their safe and peaceful home quickly unravels. When it becomes
        clear that the Barret family is being targeted by an unimaginably
        terrifying and deadly force, Daniel and Lacey take matters in their own
        hands to solve the mystery of what is after their family.</image:caption
