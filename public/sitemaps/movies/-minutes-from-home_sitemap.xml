        >The Jerusalem Airport lies along the road that links Jerusalem to
        Ramallah. It has been occupied by Israeli army since 1967, at a 5
        kilometer distance from Ramallah and 10 kilometer distance from
        Jerusalem. Today, to the east of the runway, a huge military checkpoint
        blocks the Jerusalem-Ramallah road, a dead end street. Nahed Awwad
        discovers that life has not always been like this, and that this sad
        spot used to be a place where international aircrafts landed in the
        1950s and 1960s, when Palestinians traveled freely. The happy images and
        testimonies of the past contrast bitterly with those of the present
        where access is denied to the aviation zone that is now being besieged
        behind barbed wire and soon will be trapped behind the Israeli
        Separation Wall. Nahed Awwad goes to meet this place, evoking the past
        in order to have a better apprehension of the present: todayâ€™s
        Palestinian reality that is marked by forgetfulness.</image:caption
