        >Stand up and speak to the hand! Canada's favorite sons, Barenaked
        Ladies, cross the border for their latest concert CD and first-ever live
        DVD. With a tight blend of classics including "One Week," "Pinch Me" and
        "If I Had $1,000,000" and hits from their recent releases "Barenaked
        Ladies are Me" and "Barenaked Ladies are Men," this concert showcases
        why Barenaked Ladies is one of the world's greatest touring bands. The
        concert was recorded at the DTE Energy Music Theatre in Clarkston,
        Michigan.</image:caption
