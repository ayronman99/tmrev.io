        >After stealing a huge stash of drugs, speed freaks Hector and Dorena
        plan to cook up an enormous batch of crystal meth and get rich quick.
        Hector's old buddy Merle has the perfect hideout/meth lab: an old,
        abandoned farmhouse in the woods where no one will ever find them.
        Unfortunately, no one will hear their screams either. Turns out, they
        may not be alone after all. It seems this farmhouse is the site of a
        horrific urban legend. Now, holed up together with nothing to do but
        snort, smoke and shoot up, the strung-out "cookers" fall prey to
        paranoia, private demons and terrifying visions which, whether they are
        hallucinations or hauntings, are equally terrifying and just as
        deadly!</image:caption
