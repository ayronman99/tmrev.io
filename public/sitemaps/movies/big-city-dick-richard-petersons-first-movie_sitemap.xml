        >This is a captivating journey into the world of a savant street
        musician and his lifelong struggle to become a successful recording
        artist, and to be loved. He is a street trumpeter and part-time guest on
        a local rock radio station. Richard Peterson fills his world with
        obsessions, like "Sea Hunt" (and the "Son of Sea Hunt," Jeff Bridges),
        the "The Golden Age of Television" production music (which inspires four
        albums/CDs produced with help from the Seattle music scene), stalking
        local TV celebrities, and a fanatical interest in Johnny Mathis. The
        unique relationship between Richard and Mathis is the catalyst for one
        of Richard's most remarkable compositions, "Love on the Golf Course".
        Between street gigs and a stint as a piano player in a grunge club,
        mega-band " The Stone Temple Pilots" discovers Richard's music.
        Richard's moment in the spotlight is short-lived when he is confronted
        by the human cost of obsessions, revealing the dark family secret he has
        lived with his entire life.</image:caption
