        >The story of the investigation to unravel the mysterious death of a
        beautiful young woman in Nazi-occupied Warsaw. She is not Krystyna
        Holzer, as stated in her kennkarte (German-issued identity document),
        but a Jewess kept hidden by a Pole - a polonized Saxon - attorney Karol
        Karlzer. Before the outbreak of war, the woman was his student as well
        as the object of his unrequited love. The case is assigned to Detective
        Chief Inspector Rafal Kr√≥l, an officer of the so- -called Blue Police
        under the control of the German occupiers, but also a soldier of the
        Polish underground, sworn to execute his orders. It is a suspenseful
        story set in the faithfully-recreated reality of occupied Warsaw and
        Zakopane.</image:caption
