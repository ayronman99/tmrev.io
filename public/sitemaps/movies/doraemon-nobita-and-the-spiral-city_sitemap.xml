        >After Suneo bragged about having a ranch, Nobita was asked whether or
        not he has one, pressuring him to say yes. Doraemon won a number of
        lotteries for useless planets in the belt between Mars and Jupiter. When
        Suneo and the rest came to see the ranch, Nobita happened to read the
        last of the lottery number to the go-anywhere-door, leading them to a
        huge dreamlike area. As Nobita's toy horse pranced around because of the
        wind-up life gadget, Suneo and the others became interested in doing the
        same to their toys and let them live in the area. So they decided to
        make their own clockwork city.</image:caption
