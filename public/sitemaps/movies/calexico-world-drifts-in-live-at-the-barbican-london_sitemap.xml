        >Live, the performance from November 2002 as part of the Beyond
        Nashville Festival. The stage is filled with musicians and their
        instruments - guitars, drums, trumpets, harps, violins and some that are
        less recognisable. Calexico are a breath of fresh air. They could be
        equally at home playing with alternative country artists, at festivals,
        with rock bands or on the streets of Mexico - their adopted home land
        that is portrayed so beautifully in their music and captured so
        elegantly on this video.</image:caption
