        >When Natalie (Anni Krueger) learns her cousin Francesca (Nia Vardalos)
        must cancel the Christmas Eve opening of her new Italian restaurant,
        Natalie’s heart goes out to all of the guests who were planning on
        attending. Since no one should be alone on Christmas, Natalie decides to
        make the opening happen any way she can. However, the attractive but
        pessimistic Chef Stefano (Gilles Marini) believes it’s impossible –
        there are only three days until Christmas! But Natalie insists that
        problems are just opportunities in disguise and soon she convinces
        Stefano that they can do it. At first, these opposites do not attract,
        but feelings begin to change when they find themselves working
        side-by-side. With Stefano’s help Natalie learns that cooking, like
        Christmas, isn’t about perfection…it’s about sharing it with the ones
        you love.</image:caption
