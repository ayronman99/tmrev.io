        >Takizawa prevented Japan's destruction - and then he vanished. Six
        months later, clues lead Saki to the Big Apple in search of her missing
        friend. Meanwhile, the remaining Selecao are plotting their final move.
        Some of them would prefer Takizawa dead and out of the way. Some might
