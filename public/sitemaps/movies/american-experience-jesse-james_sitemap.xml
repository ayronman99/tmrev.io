        >The story of Jesse James is one of America's most familiar myths — and
        one of its most wrong-headed. James, so the legend goes, was a Western
        outlaw, but in reality, he never went west. He has been called America's
        own Robin Hood, yet he robbed both rich and poor, and was never seen to
        share his ill-gotten gains. He was known as a gunfighter — but his
        victims were almost always unarmed. Less heroic than brutal, James was a
        member of a vicious band of Missouri guerrillas during the Civil War and
        sought vengeance for the Confederate defeat afterwards. In a life
        steeped in prolific violence and bloodshed, he met what was perhaps the
        most fitting end.</image:caption
