        >High school sweethearts QiaoQiao and Li Xing are about to graduate from
        university and Li Xing surprises QiaoQiao with a marriage proposal.
        QiaoQiao, however, declines the proposal, offering rash arguments as to
        why he's not ready. Little does he know, QiaoQiao has a devastating
        secret. Nonetheless, they write a break-up contract; if they're both
        single in five years, they'll get married. The two part ways and five
        years pass. Believing Li Xing is still waiting for her, QiaoQiao waits
        patiently for his call. But when Li Xing finally does contact her it's
        to invite her to his wedding. QiaoQiao is flabbergasted and is
        determined to win her former flame back at any cost-even though the
        secret that forced them apart lingers. Can their love truly be
        reignited?</image:caption
