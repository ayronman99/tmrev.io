        >Deep underwater in the Marianas Trench an accident results in a
        devastating Tsunami that destroys the Hawaiian Islands as it continues
        toward the west coast. Panic ensues all up and down the western coast of
        North and South America. In an attempt to lessen its impact, scientists
        launch an underwater explosion that inadvertently makes the tsunami more
        powerful and focused on Los Angeles. Scientists rush to a solution while
        the military begins planning for the worst. Los Angeles begins emergency
        evacuation. Lives and loves are lost even as a brash young grad student
        comes up with a solution: start the mother of all earthquakes to counter
        the rushing torrent and raise the continental shelf off the coast of the
        United States.</image:caption
