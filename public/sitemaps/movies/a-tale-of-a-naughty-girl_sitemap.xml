        >Based on a short story by Bengali writer Prafulla Roy, the central idea
        developed by director Dasgupta, tells the story of a girl, Lati, whose
        mother Rajani is a prostitute living and working in a brothel in rural
        India. Rajani plans to offer her daughter to an older man, a rich
        husband and protector to her daughter. Lati, however, wants to return to
        school and finish her studies. Unwilling to pay such a price for
        material success, she runs away to Calcutta. The discovery of this new
        world is described parallel to other stories of emancipation, such as
        that of three young prostitutes, of an aged couple going nowhere and
        man's n landing on the moon. In a surrealistic approach typical of the
        director, a clumsy cat and an intelligent donkey are also present in the
        film.</image:caption
