        >A Tear in the Sky takes you on an unprecedented journey into the
        UAP/UFO phenomenon as we follow a team of world-renowned experts,
        scientists, and military personnel who will attempt to unravel the
        UAP/UFO mysteries using state-of-the-art, military-grade equipment, and
        technology. While the UFO phenomenon has existed since the dawn of
        recorded history, very little scientific research is accessible to the
        public. Most of the serious research is conducted by various governments
        and militaries across the planet; this film is a documentary on how a
        team of military veterans, scientists, and researchers come together and
        launch an investigation into this fascinating world of the unknown while
        providing the data and results to the public.</image:caption
