        >For a gay filmmaker, filming in Saudi Arabia presents two serious
        challenges: filming is forbidden in the country and homosexuality is
        punishable by death. For filmmaker Parvez Sharma, however, these were
        risks he had to assume as he embarked on his Hajj pilgrimage, a journey
        considered the greatest accomplishment and aspiration within Islam, his
        religion. On his journey Parvez aims to look beyond 21st-century Islamâ€™s
        crises of religious extremism, commercialism and sectarian battles. He
        brings back the story of the religion like it has never been told
        before, having endured the biggest jihad there is: the struggle with the
        self.</image:caption
