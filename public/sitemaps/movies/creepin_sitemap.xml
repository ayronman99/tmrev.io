        >Scarier than Freddie! More frightful than Jason! Deadlier than a
        psycho! It's Mileek and Chuckie's illegitimate daughter, Shameeka! For
        some, the 1st and 15th of each month means a payday, but for those
        living in 'Da Hood' it's a day to fear as Mileek stalks the streets
        looking for unsuspecting victims to murder. He then hangs the tennis
        shoes of his sacrificial lambs from a power line. Enter Mike and Laura,
        a lost young couple who are trying to find their way back to their
        suburban dwelling. Mileek sees the couple as easy prey, but once they
        escape, Mileek decides to enlist the help of Shameeka - a killer in her
        own right who seeks vengeance against the men in the hood who refuse to
        pay child support. As the unlikely couples battle it out, all of the
        villainous clich√©s of films past pop up in hilarious satires of the most
        classic horror moments of all time!</image:caption
