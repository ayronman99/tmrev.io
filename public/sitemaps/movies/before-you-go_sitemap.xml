        >The funny, heart-warming and moving new film, from director Lewis
        Gilbert. When Violet Heaney's three daughters return home for her
        funeral, each sister finds her own way of coping with her loss. For
        Teresa, the eldest, it's herbal tea, obsessive cleaning and hectoring
        her long-suffering husband, Frank. Catherine, the youngest, resorts to
        retail therapy, industrial quantities of marijuana and manic phone calls
        to her elusive boyfriend in Barcelona. Middle daughter Mary seeks
        consolation in professional detachment and the arms of her lover, Mike.
        Like Mary, Mike's a doctor. Unlike Mary, he's married... The sisters
        soon discover that their early memories have grown fuzzy over time and
        the past becomes fuzzier still as they attempt to cope with their
        mother's parting.</image:caption
