        >Betty (August Arroya) was the wildest girl at the Police Academy, ready
        to take on anything - or anyone. So along with her diploma, she earned
        quite the reputation, and a nickname to go with it: Betty Danger. Her
        friends always said she'd either become a Vice Detective, or get picked
        up by one, so when she received her promotion to join the Vice Squad,
        she knew she found her true calling.</image:caption
