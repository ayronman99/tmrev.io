        >AMERICAN JESUS is an exploration of Christianity in every faction of
        American Life, from the breadline to the yoga studio, from the humble
        churches of snake handlers to the mega churches in the ex-urbs.
        Christian cowboys, bikers and musicians, comedians, surfers and
        cage-fighters, they are all doing it for Christ. Aram Garriga travels
        from his native Barcelona to the politically divided United States to
        chronicle the sometimes bizarre relationship between faith, materialism,
        politics and personal passions in this uniquely American tableaux.
        Populated by an array of religious and secular characters offering
        candid, often illuminating testimonials, AMERICAN JESUS is a vivid
        mosaic of personalities and conflicting points of view that emerges as a
        portrait of an America yearning for solace and meaning in the modern
        world.</image:caption
