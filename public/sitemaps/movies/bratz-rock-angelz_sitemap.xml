        >The Bratz girls have hit upon the perfect way to express themselves and
        their stylin' creativity by starting up their own teen magazine. Yasmin,
        Chloe, Jade, and Sasha are in for some fashion-forward adventure when
        their first task at the mag is to fly to London to cover a super-hot
        rock concert. Unfortunately, rival journalists from YOUR THING magazine
        have gotten the same idea. Mean-spirited editor Burdine Maxwell and her
        evil interns, twins Kirstee and Kaycee, happen to show up right when the
        Bratz girls lose their passes to the show. Coincidence? Probably not,
        but now the girls have to find another way to get in, and they realize
        the only way they can get access is to become a rock band themselves!
        It's time to rock out and save the mag, all in a day's work for these
        hip chicks.</image:caption
