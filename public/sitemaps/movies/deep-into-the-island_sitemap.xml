        >If you take a stroll about the Russian lands on Google Maps, you will
        at some point find yourself on a string of islands lost in the Pacific
        waters. The largest of them is Bering Island. A small settlement,
        Nikolskoye, is perched on its edge. Protagonist Arkasha [hypocoristic
        for Arkadiy] is 17. Heâ€™s been living his whole life on the island but
        this summer he graduates from school and prepares to leave home. He
        likes making cakes, which is why he decided to pursue further education
        as a food technologist in Smolensk. With only a few days left until
        Arkasha takes off, his best friend breaks both arms quite badly, while
        the Island becomes overcast with thunder clouds.</image:caption
