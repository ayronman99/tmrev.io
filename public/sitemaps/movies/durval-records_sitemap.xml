        >Durval and his mother Carmita live at the back of "Durval Discos", a
        record store they own in SÃ£o Paulo, specializing in vinyl records. They
        lead a boring and unattractive life, until the day Durval hires a maid,
        Celia, to help his mother with the housekeeping. However, on her second
        day, Celia goes away leaving a 5-year-old child behind, Kiki, and a note
        promising to be back in a couple of days. Durval and Celia are charmed
        by the child at first, but soon they see some sad news about Celia and
        Kiki on TV that will change the whole situation.</image:caption
