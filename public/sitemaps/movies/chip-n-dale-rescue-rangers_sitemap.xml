        >Decades since their successful television series was canceled, Chip has
        succumbed to a life of suburban domesticity as an insurance salesman.
        Dale, meanwhile, has had CGI surgery and works the nostalgia convention
        circuit, desperate to relive his glory days. When a former cast mate
        mysteriously disappears, Chip and Dale must repair their broken
        friendship and take on their Rescue Rangers detective personas once
        again to save their friendâ€™s life.</image:caption
