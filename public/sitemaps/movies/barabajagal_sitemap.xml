        >In Frances Stark's Cat Videos 1999 - 2002, the artist's cats are
        featured playing and lounging in her apartment. The videos are a result
        of Stark being inspired by the visual pleasure of watching her cats and
        the way their movement changed her perception of her domestic
        surroundings. By utilizing the soundtrack of one diegetic song per
        video, the life of the domestic cat - which usually involves no plans or
        action - is framed, and then elevated as a work of art. The videos,
        produced pre-Youtube in 1999-2002, predict our current extensive
        consumption and emotional responses to online cat videos, and
        unintentionally explore the rise of rapid attention span as a response
        to current technologies.</image:caption
