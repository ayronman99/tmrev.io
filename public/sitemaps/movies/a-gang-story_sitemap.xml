        >After growing up in a poor gypsy camp, Edmond Vidal, aka Momon, has
        retained a sense of family, unfailing loyalty and pride in his origins.
        Most of all, he has remained friends with Serge Suttel, with whom he
        first discovered prison life - for stealing cherries. The two of them
        inevitably got involved in organized crime. The team they formed, the
        Ganf Des Lyonnais, made them the most notorious armed robbers of the
        early 1970s. Their irresistible rise ended in 1974 with a spectacular
        arrest. Today, as he nears 60, Momon would like to forget that part of
        his life. He has found peace by retiring from the "business". He tends
        to his wife Janou, who suffered so in the past, and to his children and
        grandchildren, all of whom have great respect for this man of simple and
        universal values, so clear-headed and full of kindness. But then Serge
        Suttel, who has disowned nothing of his past, comes back into the
        picture.</image:caption
