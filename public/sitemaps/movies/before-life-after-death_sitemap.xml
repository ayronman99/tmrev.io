        >Gauri, a student, is dating a worker at her father’s hawker stall. One
        day, she discovers she is pregnant—news that worsens the fractured
        relationship with her father and stepmother. During a visit to the
        gynaecologist’s clinic, Gauri strikes a chord with her doctor, Radhika,
        who is struggling to come to terms with a huge loss in her life. Their
        unlikely bond proves to be a welcome change in both their
        lives.</image:caption
