        >The Ultimate Guide was a documentary made by BBC Events Production in
        London which aired on BBC Three in the run-up to the 50th anniversary of
        the Doctor Who. It gave a broad overview of the show's history, and
        interviewed many people involved in its production over the years,
        including five of the actors who portrayed the Doctor: Peter Davison,
        Colin Baker, Sylvester McCoy, Paul McGann and David Tennant â€” as well as
        the current executive producer and head writer Steven
        Moffat.</image:caption
