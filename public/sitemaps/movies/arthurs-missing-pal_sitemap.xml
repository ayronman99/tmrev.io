        >No overview found.When Arthur's dog Pal disappears, Arthur must enlist
        the help of his friends to track him down. While Pal discovers his
        newfound freedom, Arthur discovers how much he misses his dog. Good
        thing Arthur has the gang to turn to--especially his best friend, Buster
        Baxter who dusts off his old detective gear to get on the case. This
        canine quest leads Arthur and Buster across Elwood city, deep into the
        bowels of an ice cream factory, past a giant cow on ice skates, and
        right up to the point where all hope seems lost. Could the solution to
        this caper, though, be right in front of Arthur's eyes? And why has DW
        been acting funny so lately? One thing's for certain, Arthur is
        determined to get to the bottom of this case. Follow Arthur, Buster, and
        all their friends through the streets of Elwood City as they sniff out
        clues and chase after leads...and learn a valuable lesson about
        friendship, teamwork, and responsibility</image:caption
