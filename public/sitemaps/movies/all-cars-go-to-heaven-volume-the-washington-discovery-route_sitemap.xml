        >Why did the team behind "The Smoking Tire" decide to drive 600 miles,
        off-road, in a cheap car that they bought over the phone? Is it because
        they have deep knowledge of outdoor survival and automotive maintenance?
        No. Definitely not. They did it because away from roads, street signs,
        people, and police, they would be free to experience every aspect of
        driving; the good, the bad, and the ugly. There's no one to say, "Don't
        stand on that moving car." or "Don't run into that." or, "That seems
        really stupid." If you love cars, total vehicular freedom is your idea
        of heaven. This series is about 4 guys testing the limits of
        automobiles, and bringing them to heaven.</image:caption
