        >The Caldwells take a family trip to Puerto Rico where their father is
        also securing a secret business deal, while the kids find their own
        paths. Eight years have passed since the events of Au Pair, and newly
        graduated as his high school's valedictorian, Alexander Caldwell joins
        his visiting sister, college freshman Katie and her roommate Ariana on a
        family summer vacation with father Oliver and stepmother Jenny. Oliver
        and Jenny's current nanny declines to join them and the over-worked
        parents/executives must take care of their newborn baby Sarah in Puerto
        Rico. Amidst corporate scheming by the young company CFO Walter Hausen,
        who is planning a takeover of Oliver's company CCI Tekhausen (formed in
        Au Pair II), Oliver and Jenny must contend with bridging the generation
        gap with the family, new career motivations and the romances of their
        'newly reformed' prankster kids.</image:caption
