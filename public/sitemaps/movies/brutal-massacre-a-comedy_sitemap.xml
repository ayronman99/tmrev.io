        >Harry Penderecki, a once heralded horror auteur, finds himself on the
        outside looking in at Hollywood. He hasn't had a hit film in years, and
        most in the industry, including his close friends, think he's washed up.
        Harry is given one last chance to redeem himself with what could be his
        best or last picture. Brutal Massacre becomes just that, as the cast and
        crew find themselves battling one mishap after another as Harry
        struggles to keep his sanity against overwhelming resistance to finish
        the picture and find himself at the top once again.</image:caption
