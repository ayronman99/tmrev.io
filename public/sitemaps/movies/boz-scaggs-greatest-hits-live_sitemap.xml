        >Singer-songwriter-guitarist Boz Scaggs has kept a fairly low profile
        since his heyday in the '70s and '80s--a circumstance more than
        rectified with Greatest Hits Live, a great-looking, great-sounding
        concert recorded in San Francisco in 2004. For the most part, this is
        Silk Degrees-style Boz, drawing from a large catalog that favors ballads
        (some quite lovely, like "Harbor Lights," "We're All Alone," and "Look
        What You've Done to Me") and deft pop-R&amp;B-jazz Ã  la Steely Dan
        (albeit with more soul and less verbal wit and sophistication). But
        while "Lido Shuffle," and other expected hits are here, so are several
        grittier, bluesier moments, including Earl King's "It All Went Down the
        Drain" and extended versions of the big band blues "Runnin' Blue" and
        the slow lament "Loan Me a Dime" (a tune from Scaggs's 1969 solo album
        that featured great guitar playing by the late Duane
        Allman).</image:caption
