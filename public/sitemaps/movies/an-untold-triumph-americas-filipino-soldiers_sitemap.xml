        >During World War II, 7,000 Filipino Americans volunteered their
        services to the U.S. Army and helped liberate their homeland from
        Japanese occupation. Director Noel M. Izon captures their stories
        through the voices of the veterans themselves – only half of whom are
        still alive today – and delivers touching personal accounts of the men’s
        contributions and sacrifices during the war. Despite the fact that they
        endured a bleak, racist prewar climate and were not even considered U.S.
        citizens, these individuals rallied to join the war effort and cement
        their rightful place in American history.</image:caption
