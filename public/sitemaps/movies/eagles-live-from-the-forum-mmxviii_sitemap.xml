        >In 2016, after Glenn Frey died, the Eagles went on a hiatus as Don
        Henley decided that the band would not play again. However, Henley
        reversed his decision and it was announced in March 2017 that the Eagles
        would perform in two festivals featuring classic rock bands organized by
        their manager Irving Azoff, starting with The Classic West festival held
        at the Dodger Stadium in July that year. Henley brought in Frey's son
        Deacon to perform with the remaining members of the Eagles in these
        shows after he saw Deacon performed Glenn Frey's songs at his memorial
        service.</image:caption
