        >Featuring a tour de force performance from Simon Callow, Being
        Shakespeare is a one-man show about the life and work of the world’s
        greatest playwright. Written by the renowned scholar Jonathan Bate, and
        taking its cue from Jacques’ famous ‘Seven Ages of Man’ speech in As You
        Like It, the drama traces Shakespeare’s life from his birth in
        Stratford-upon-Avon in 1564 to his burial there fifty-two years later.
        Weaving together this story with extracts from many of Shakespeare’s
        most famous plays, Simon Callow presents a vivid and very human portrait
        of the man and of the Elizabethan world in which he lived. Recorded
        before an audience during the play’s triumphant London run, Being
        Shakespeare is both a wonderful introduction to the author and a richly
        nuanced, funny and fascinating study for those who already love his
        plays.</image:caption
