        >Warning: Baltimore is no longer safe. Meet Leemoid, Zagatile and
        Interbyce. They're the three aliens whose spaceship has crashed in a
        small town outside of Baltimore. Soon the town folk are turning up
        mutilated and dead - and even in polyester pants. Then a stranger
        arrives to save the day. But is he who he says he is? And what about all
        the polyester pants? See this film they way it was meant to be seen - on
        the big screen live with Cinematic Titanic.</image:caption
