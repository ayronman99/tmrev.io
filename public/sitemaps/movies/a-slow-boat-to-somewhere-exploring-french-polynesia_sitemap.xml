        >Ride along on a rustic, and rusting, Polynesian cargo boat as it makes
        deliveries to 21 of the globe's most isolated coral reef atolls, in the
        heart of the South Pacific Ocean. Along the 3,000-mile route meet black
        pearl divers, the man who found the Kon Tiki, Marlon Brando's 'Mutiny'
        girlfriend, a ship laden with NFL-sized crewman and many more - all set
        against the backdrop of a fast-and-forever changing Paradise. I jumped
        on the cargo boat for one of its monthly, 3,000-mile delivery jobs,
        taking us to ports-of-call that were literally just piles of sand and
        rock washed up on rims of coral, halfway between Australia and South
        America, each home to populations ranging from seven to two hundred
        fifty people. The trip took us through the Tuamotus, a chain of 78
        atolls that sailors going back to Magellan dubbed the dangerous
        archipelago for its low-lying, barely visible, wooden-boat-sinking
        reefs.</image:caption
