        >Hiroshi and Misae have never been to a honeymoon trip to a foreign
        country. One day, Misae discovered an inexpensive and family-friendly
        holiday package to Australia and the Nohara family decided to make it
        their first honeymoon vacation. Hiroshi gets kidnapped upon arrival to
        Australia, leaving Shinnosuke, Misae and others on a dangerous journey.
        It turns out that Hiroshi is the key to a secret treasure. The remaining
        members of the Nohara Family must rescue Hiroshi, while a mysterious
        masked man and treasure hunters from all over the world are after him.
        The struggle is among three different groups in this action-filled
        treasure hunting adventure.</image:caption
