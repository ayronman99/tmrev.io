        >Edward is tired of the "allowance" granted him by his older sister,
        Amanda and becomes impatient for her death, and his part of Father's
        inheritance. Amanda has suffered from two heart attacks already, and
        Edward believes the third time will be a charm. To help induce another
        attack, Edward hires an ex-con nurse, Esther to "scare her to death".
        However, Esther becomes less than enthusiastic about killing Amanda, but
        becomes increasingly more curious about the secrets held in the house,
        including a mysterious third sister, Meredith. An eerie secluded
        mansion, a tormented recluse, strange psychosexual perversions, a
        macabre family and a ghastly secret locked away in the attic combine to
        tell a chilling tale of greed, deceit and murder!</image:caption
