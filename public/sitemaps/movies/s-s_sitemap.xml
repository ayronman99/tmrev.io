        >Los Angeles, 2006. Life is Easy 2.0 for James Pongo. He has a cushy
        job, a busy social life and an alluring love interest all through the
        click of a mouse. But when he wakes up after a night of reckless
        partying to discover that his computer is missing, James'
        hyper-connected reality takes a nosedive. This sends him on a picaresque
        journey of interrogations and humiliations with the suburban losers he
        left behind. Told entirely through the websites, programs, games and
        social networks that make up our daily lives, 0s &amp; 1s uses James
        Pongo's nihilistic adventure to question our growing dependency on these
        alternate digital realities.</image:caption
