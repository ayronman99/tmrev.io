        >Mayuko is a feng shui expert who, in a nearly absurd rush of exposition
        in the first scene of Dragon Blue, discovers that she is the blood heir
        of the Dragon Clan and a born demon hunter. It's a completely
        unmotivated but thoroughly spooky encounter between Mayuko and a demonic
        ghost, and she's saved by an ancient priest spirit who explains her
        legacy. "Why does this always happen to me?" she ponders before flying
        off to a remote island to investigate an ancient curse and battle a
        legendary Sea Demon. Mayuko befriends a burly, chivalrous detective and
        a little orphan boy nicknamed "the Devil's Child" who hides his own dark
        secret.</image:caption
