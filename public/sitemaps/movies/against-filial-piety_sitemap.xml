        >AGAINST FILIAL PIETY ponders one of the oldest Chinese beliefs; the
        gravest offense of filial piety is not to have offspring to carry on the
        family name and blood. The film also relates to feelings of failure in
        not being able to fulfill the filial responsibility. This five minute,
        single framed, 16mm experimental film includes the word “barren” from 34
        different written languages, which were extracted from dictionaries. The
        individual word or symbol disintegrates as it being enlarged to resemble
        landscapes or graphic shapes. The colorful technical drawing s of human
        anatomy and the cycle of childbirth are combined and contrasted against
        the monotone enlargement of Xerox copies of the word “barren” which
        breaks up and converges through out the progression of
        film.</image:caption
