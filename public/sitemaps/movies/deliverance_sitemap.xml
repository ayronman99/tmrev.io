        >Simon and St√©phanie, both in their 40s, are a happy couple. They share
        the joys of life and all the little moments that enrich their life
        journey together. Yet is that journey a straight road or a winding one?
        Could one small pebble halt the flow of this love life? What a disaster,
        on a beautiful Sunday morning, when disease and suffering disrupt
        savagely this wonderful harmony. Can a past love relation save one of
        today? Who, what, why -- so many questions gnawing the relation into one
        of doubt and resulting in anger and even hatred. Can the treason be
        forgiven? Will love be stronger than sorrow and
        detestation?</image:caption
