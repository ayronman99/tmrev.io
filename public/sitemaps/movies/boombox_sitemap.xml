        >One thing we love in wakeboarding videos, is a video that has a unique
        style and original feel to it. That is "Boombox". Justin Stephens and
        Cadmium Productions spent some time with the Pointless Posse along with
        Scott Byerly and Gregg Necrason to put together a video that just flat
        out works! The music in Boombox was all done by one artist called MYG
        from Portland, Oregon, and the music is full of great beats that go well
        with wakeboarding, and would sound great coming out of any boombox. Each
        rider has a strong section featuring some of the latest and greatest
        tricks in wakeboarding, and much of the film was shot from unique
        helicopter angles.</image:caption
