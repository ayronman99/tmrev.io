        >This video features two programs: one to help high school students who
        have Asperger Syndrome prepare for college, and another to help those
        with Asperger Syndrome prepare to enter the workforce after high school
        or college. It includes information about how college is different from
        high school, and how success at work depends on social skills as well as
        job skills.</image:caption
