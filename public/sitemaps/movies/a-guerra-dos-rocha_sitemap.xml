        >Clumsy old lady Dina Rocha lives with her son Marcelo. After a series
        of incidents at home, she moves to her house in Santa Teresa. She meets
        her friend Nonô and she pays a visit to her old friend. Her sons do not
        know where she is and they go to the hospitals and morgues. Coincidently
        there is the body of an old lady smashed by a truck and they believe
        that she is their mother. Meanwhile two smalltime thieves break in
        Nonô's house and keep the two old ladies locked in the bathroom. During
        the funeral of Dina Rocha, the dysfunctional families have a quarrel
        disputing their heritage.</image:caption
