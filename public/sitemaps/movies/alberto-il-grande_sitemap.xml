        >Docu-film directed by Carlo and Luca Verdone realized on 2013 in
        occasion of the tenth anniversary from the actor’s death happened on
        24th February 2003. Through this documentary Verdone’s brothers with
        deep respect towards the Roman actor trace an affectionate and sincere
        portrait not only about an Artist but, above all, about a man with his
        habits, his ideas, his tics, his vices and his virtues. And for the
        first time Mrs Aurelia – Alberto Sordi’s sister who is dedicated the
        documentary – opens the doors of the beautiful house of Via Druso where
        the actor has lived since 1958. In this way we are led by Carlo Verdone
        (a sort of Virgilio whose Dante Alighieri wrote about but we are not in
        the Hell but in the Seven Heaven where there is the source of the
        Italian Cinema) and on the tips and staying in silence we can go into
        the rooms of this wonderful house which reveals the true, authentic
        character of Alberto Sordi.</image:caption
