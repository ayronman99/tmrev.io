        >This is the story of a toad named Baz, who has suddenly, for no good
        reason which is apparent, disappears. As Baz is gone, the story of the
        theories put forth to his possible plight is told by his friend Daz,
        whose "mates call him Dazza" and who tells the story as he thinks it
        went. Daz tells the audience that he knows not where Daz went, only that
        he disappeared "like a fart in a fan factory" and that since he's
        disappeared, nobody around knows what happened to him. In this short
        film, Daz tells us his theories on what may have
        happened...</image:caption
