        >An evil Druid warlord resurrects a young man and transforms him into a
        wicked superhero. With the help of a nice young woman, the superhero
        eventually begins to question his diabolical beliefs. As if his hands
        weren't full enough with his study of good and evil, he also has to deal
        with the confusion caused by his clone, the beasts of The Druid
        Gladiator Match, and, of course, the scheming Druid
        warlord.</image:caption
