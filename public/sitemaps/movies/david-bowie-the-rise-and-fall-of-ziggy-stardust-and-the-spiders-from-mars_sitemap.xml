        >Ziggy Stardust and The Spiders from Mars was the album that did it.
        This is the definitive independent review of an all time classic album
        featuring rare interviews with Bowie and the people around him along
        with classic performances of material from the album. Also featured are
        in-depth interviews with Trevor Bolder and Woody Woodmansey. We hear
        from the musicians and insiders who took part in the making of the album
        and their uncensored interviews produce a candid, honest and frank
        retrospective on a modern masterpiece.</image:caption
