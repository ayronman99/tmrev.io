        >Absinthe: was it ambrosia or poison, artistic muse or ticket to madness
        and death? There is a tremendous fascination with absinthe, yet few
        truly know its rich history. The documentary ABSINTHE definitively
        brings the Green Fairy out of her clouded past where, for one hundred
        years, her fabled effects and demonized reputation have excited equal
        doses of admiration and loathing. The film traces absinthe’s arc: from
        its birth in Switzerland in 1787, through its rise in the chic cafés of
        Belle Époque Paris, to its prohibition, and its recent worldwide
        revival. Absinthe’s story is put in high relief through interviews with
        leading historians, authors, distillers, antiques collectors, and
        fanatics. The cult beverage of bohemian artists is back in fashion; the
        documentary ABSINTHE clarifies the legend.</image:caption
