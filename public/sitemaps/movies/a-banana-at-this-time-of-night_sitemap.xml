        >Hisashi Tanaka is a medical student in Hokkaido Prefecture, Japan. He
        does volunteer work and gets to know Yasuaki Kano at the hospital.
        Yasuaki Kano has suffered from muscular dystrophy since he was
        12-years-old. Yasuaki Kano has his eccentric ways like running out of
        the hospital and saying that he wants to eat a banana late at night.
        Hisashi Tanaka thinks Yasuaki Kano is a lovely person. Yasuaki Kano
        develops a crush on rookie volunteer Misaki Ando. He asks Hisashi Tanaka
        to write a love letter for him, but Misaki Ando is Hisashi Tanakaâ€™s
        girlfriend.</image:caption
