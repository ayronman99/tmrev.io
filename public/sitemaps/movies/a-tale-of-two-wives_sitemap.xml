        double life. He has a wife and daughter in New York. At the same time,

        'business trips', both little families lived in domestic bliss, totally
        oblivious of each-others existence. Alas the wives find out about
        each-other place in Bill's well-organized life, and let jealousy get the

        cunningly made everyone happy for so long...</image:caption
