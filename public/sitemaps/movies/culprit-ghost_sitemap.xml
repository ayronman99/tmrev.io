        >Ferry, Rifky, Simon, Aryo and Steve are best friends since young. When
        Steve is about to get married, he returns to his old neighborhood and
        invites his four buddies. Then Simon sets up a surprise bachelor party
        for Steve in an old house, with Sapphira, a sexy belly dancer. However,
        Sapphira is too tired to dance a long time so Simon initiates a game,
        the "Arch of Satan", where a spirit can be summoned. When the atmosphere
        is getting spooky, Pak Burhan, arrives to break up the party. When Steve
        arrives home, he encounters the Ghost of the Old Woman they had summoned
        earlier. The next day, they are all still haunted by several spirits.
        Ferry also meets a mysterious girl who begins to steal his
        heart.</image:caption
