        >Ireland, 1845 on the eve of The Great Hunger. Colmán Sharkey, a
        fisherman, a father, a husband, takes in a stranger at the behest of a
        local priest. Patsy, a former soldier in the Napoleonic wars arrives
        just ahead of 'the blight,' a disease that eventually wipes out the
        country's potato crop, contributing to the death and displacement of
        millions. As the crops rot in the fields, Colmán, his brother and Patsy
        travel to the English Landlord's house to request a stay on rent
        increases that Colmán predicts will destroy his community. His request
        falls deaf ears and Patsy's subsequent actions set Colmán on a path that
        will take him to the edge of survival, and sanity. It is only upon
        encountering an abandoned young girl that Colmán's resolve is lifted.
        Just in time for the darkness of his past to pay another
        visit.</image:caption
