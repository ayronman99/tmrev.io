        >An arrogant medical man discovers there's more to his new patient than
        he imagined in this drama from Polish filmmaker Feliks Falk. Dr.
        Konstanty Grot (Borys Szyc) is an ambitious young doctor who is
        determined to make a name for himself, to the point that his wife often
        accuses him of being more interested in his career than in her. Grot
        believes that he can earn the respect of his peers by successfully
        treating a supposedly incurable patient, and he believes he may have
        found a likely candidate in Pawel Plocki (Grzegorz Wolf), a mental
        patient who can barely function. Grot signs Plocki out of the mental
        hospital where he's been treated for years and moves him into his own
        home; in time, Plocki shows genuine improvement, and Grot thinks he?s
        beaten the state medical establishment at their own game. But that?s
        before Grot learns some secrets about his patient that cast his
        condition in a new and disturbing light.</image:caption
