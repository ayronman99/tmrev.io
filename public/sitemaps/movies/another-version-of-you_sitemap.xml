        >Diggsy (Kristopher Wente) has been in love with Suzette (Sara Antonio)
        since he was 9 years old. After she marries someone else, he encounters
        a mysterious stranger (Eddie George) who offers him a key that can open
        doors into parallel universes. This uncanny opportunity gives him a
        chance to find a version of Suzette who will love him back. During his
        journey, he unexpectedly meets Gwyneth (C.J. Perry), a wild card who may
        throw his universe-jumping adventure for a loop. For Diggsy, this is a
        tale full of surprises, awkward encounters, and the possibility of
        finding the perfect version of that someone who will love you
        back.</image:caption
