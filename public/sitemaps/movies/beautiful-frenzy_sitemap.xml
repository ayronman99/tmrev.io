        >The Dutch band The Ex has been around for more than twenty years. All
        this time, nothing much has changed. Only their music is constantly
        developing. From straightforward punk to improvised music - again and
        again, new ground is broken. The music, the mutual concord and the
        interaction with the audience reflect an attitude to life based on
        obstinacy and curiosity, and certainly not on conformity or pleasing
        large audiences. The Ex organise their own concerts, have their own
        record label and play with just as much fervour in a hall with three
        thousand people as in a tiny squat. With this rather un-American style,
        the band has managed to survive for many years in a music industry that
        is mainly concerned with sales figures.</image:caption
