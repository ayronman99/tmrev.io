        once the eternally classic love story of Romeo and Juliet in the guise
        of Bonnie and Clyde substance, as bloody road movie. On the other end
        with a romantic fantasy. This film also tells of growing up. Our story
        is told against the backdrop of a dying industrial area on two versions
        about the love between two lots of chance: the 17-year-old Jenny and
        19-year-old Paule, leading her life in series of unfortunate, even
        tragic circumstances of the death. Or, with alternative conclusion: the
        17-year-old Jenny and 19-year-old Paule, which almost leads her life
        despite unfortunate chain, even tragic circumstances in the sky of
        love.</image:caption
