        >With the original intention of empowering a citizenry's ability to
        defend themselves against a corrupt or tyrannical government, the
        concept today may seem farfetched or the makings of a Hollywood
        blockbuster. However, it has happened throughout U.S. history. And long
        before gun control was positioned as a "common sense measure" to combat
        violence, it was used as a means to oppress certain minority groups.
        Presently, the growing trend in gun control favors the wealthy and
        privileged, who leverage their connections to ensure their Second
        Amendment rights and safety, while those of lesser means struggle.
        Informative and emotionally charged, "Assaulted: Civil Rights Under
        Fire" is an eye-opening look at the genesis of the Second Amendment to
        the Constitution, leading the audience to rethink the issues surrounding
        gun control, and the effect on civil rights and liberty. After all, what
        you don't know can kill you.</image:caption
