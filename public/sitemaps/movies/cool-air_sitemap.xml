        >Charlie Baxter, a struggling screenwriter, is searching for
        accommodation in a rundown mansion somewhere in the isolated mountains
        above Malibu. An expressionless and creatively bankrupt young man who
        rewrites exploitation sci-fi / horror scripts for a living, he takes a
        room in the mansion and learns of the mysterious doctor residing in the
        room above his own who dabbles in strange experiments. As he learns more
        about the circumstances of the doctor and the history of his landlady,
        her autistic daughter and the strange lodger across the hall, Baxter is
        inspired to write his long blocked "great American Screenplay". Working
        furiously, Baxter suffers a heart attack, and staggers up to see the
        doctor for treatment. He passes out immediately, but awakens a cured
        man. But at a terrible price.</image:caption
