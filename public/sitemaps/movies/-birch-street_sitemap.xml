        >Documentary filmmaker Doug Block had every reason to believe his
        parents' 54-year marriage was a good one. But when his mother dies
        unexpectedly and his father swiftly marries his former secretary, he
        discovers two parents who are far more complex and troubled than he ever
        imagined. 51 Birch Street is a riveting personal documentary that
        explores a universal human question: how much about your parents do you
        really want to know?</image:caption
