        >Ranmalee, a village girl talented in both music and dancing meets the
        son (Praveen) of a businessman who are on a visit to Ranmalee's village
        in search of a site to build their new hotel. Even though they had
        developed feelings for each other, Praveen's family doesn't accept their
        relationship. Meanwhile, Ranmalee comes across a photographer who's a
        friend of a leading entrepreneur (Sapumal) in the music industry and he
        helps her join Sapumal's dancing troupe. Ranmalee becomes very famous
        with her debut productions and Sapumal catches feelings for her.
        Ranmalee couldn't say "no" to her boss, but she's puzzled with the vibes
        from the relationship with Praveen.</image:caption
