        >A documentary about the story of Kathryn Calder, one of the vocalists
        behind the Influential and successful indie band The New Pornographers,
        who puts her life on hold when her mother is diagnosed with ALS. After
        moving back to her childhood home to care for her mother, she is
        inspired to record her first solo album, Are You My Mother? there as a
        gift to her as she fights the disease. Old bandmates, friends, and a new
        extended family she'd only recently discovered all join Kathryn in her
        and her mother's journey. Initially funded by the Canadian charity The
        Yellow Bird Project, donations raised through a successful Kickstarter
        campaign helped to complete the film and travel the festival circuit. It
        was released digitally via iTunes in April, 2017.</image:caption
