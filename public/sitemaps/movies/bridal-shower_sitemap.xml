        >Three advertising executives are doomed to perpetually look for the
        right man. Tates, Katie and Sonia are all are stuck in a rut with love,
        sex and marriage. Tates will do whatever it takes to just to have the
        man she wants even if he is tangled in a messy annulment case and even
        if it takes her to shed a lot of money to have him. Katie found her love
        story with a macho dancer but is scared to let her friends know because
        of his unconventional job. So she tries to give him a more decent look
        for her friends to see. She also finds bodily insecurities because of
        her chubby physique. Sonia is the two-timing chick that finds her self
        pregnant while being with two men. She is in-love with a painter but
        finds more security with a rich man. Despite her strong feelings for the
        former, she chooses to be with the latter in order to provide better for
        her and her child.</image:caption
