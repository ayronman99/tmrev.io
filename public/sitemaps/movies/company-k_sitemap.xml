        >Based on the popular World War I novel by author William March,
        director Robert Clem's COMPANY K follows a veteran of the first great
        conflict as he finishes a book about his wartime experiences and
        reflects on how a man's true character is revealed through his actions
        on the battlefield. From the German soldier who visits him in dreams to
        the camaraderie that is forged by fighting together and the true gravity
        of laying down your life for a greater cause, World War I veteran Joe
        Delaney will attempt to exorcise his demons through writing while
        struggling to readjust to small-town life following the trauma of
        war.</image:caption
