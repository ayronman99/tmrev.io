        >Chet Atkins was a gifted solo artist, but it was his stellar
        musicianship and producing talents that allowed country music to cross
        over into the mainstream. In 1980, Atkins gathered some musician friends
        together for this unique television special. Selected guests include Don
        Gibson, The Statler Brothers, The Charlie Daniels Band and Roger Miller.
        Featured tracks include "Battle of New Orleans," "Sugarfoot Rag," "Bye
        Bye Love" and more.</image:caption
