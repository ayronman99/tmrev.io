        >Historian Dr Janina Ramirez unlocks the secrets of a centuries-old
        masterpiece in glass. At 78 feet in height, the famous East Window at
        York Minster is the largest medieval stained-glass window in the country
        and it was the creative vision of a single artist - a mysterious master
        craftsman called John Thornton, one of the earliest named English
        artists. The East Window of York Minster is far more than a work of
        artistic genius, it is a window onto the medieval world and the medieval
        mind - telling us who were once were and who we still are, all preserved
        in the most fragile medium of all.</image:caption
