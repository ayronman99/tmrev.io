        >Crusty Demons: The Next Level is the follow up release to the
        successful action sports feature Crusty Demons Of Dirt. This feature
        follows the same successful formula of massive jumps and stunts set to a
        music soundtrack. During this feature there are numerous shots of people
        riding BMX bikes and snowmobiles as well as the more familiar dirt
        bikes. Seth Enslow returns in this feature and shows why he has become
        one of the most recognized people associated with this sport. During the
        feature we briefly see Seth's world record attempt to jump his friends
        house, as well as an attempt by Paul Fernandez on a BMX bike to jump
        onto an apartment roof after being pulled up to speed by a
        car.</image:caption
