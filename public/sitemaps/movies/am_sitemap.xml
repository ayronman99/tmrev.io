        >Amá is a feature length documentary which tells an important and untold
        story: the abuses committed against Native American women by the United
        States Government during the 1960’s and 70’s: removed from their
        families and sent to boarding schools, forced relocation away from their
        traditional lands and involuntary sterilization. ​The result of nine
        years painstaking and sensitive work by filmmaker Lorna Tucker, the film
        features the testimony of many Native Americans, including three
        remarkable women who tell their stories - Jean Whitehorse, Yvonne Swan
        and Charon Aseytoyer - as well as a revealing and rare interview with
        Dr. Reimart Ravenholt whose population control ideas were the framework
        for some of the government policies directed at Native American
        women.</image:caption
