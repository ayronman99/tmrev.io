        >Shot in 1997 and premiered at Documenta XI in 2002, An Estranged
        Paradise displays many of Yang's signature motifs — crisp
        black-and-white 35mm cinematography, storylines that blur
        contemporaneity with traditional stylistics, homages to/revisions of
        genre cinema akin to the early work of his influences Jean-Luc Godard
        and Jim Jarmusch — while also reflecting his early studies as a painter,
        notably in a prologue that muses on the traditional methods and
        subjectivity of Chinese landscape painting. Set in the city of Hangzhou
        (where Yang had studied at the China Academy of Fine Art), the film
        takes as its focal point a restless young man, Zhu Zi, following him as
        he aimlessly wanders through the city. Through a series of distinct
        vignettes, Yang depicts Zhu Zi's inability to find comfort in friends,
        lovers or environment as a reflection of the existential difficulty of
        China's "nameless generation," cast adrift during the rapid changes at
        the turn of the millennium.</image:caption
