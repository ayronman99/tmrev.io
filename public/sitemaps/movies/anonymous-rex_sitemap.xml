        >The dinosaurs didn't go completely extinct when the asteroids hit 65
        million years ago. Today, every ten thousandth person in the country is
        a dinosaur, evolved to be human-sized, wearing sophisticated solid-light
        holographic disguises to maintain the facade, getting stoned off regular
        cooking herbs like basil, rosemary and tarragon, and living by their own
        shadow government's laws; any human who stumbles upon them is to be
        immediately executed. Two dino private investigators, velociraptor
        Vincent Rubio and triceratops Ernie Watson, are hired by one of Ernie's
        old girlfriends to find out why her younger brother committed suicide,
        and discover a dino cult called Voice Of Progress that wants dinokind to
        come out of the closet and reclaim the planet.</image:caption
