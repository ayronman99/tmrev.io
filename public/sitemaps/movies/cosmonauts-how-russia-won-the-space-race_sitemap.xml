        >When Neil Armstrong stepped onto the moon in 1969, America went down in
        popular history as the winner of the space race. But that history is
        bunk. The real pioneers of space exploration were the Soviet cosmonauts.
        This remarkable feature-length documentary combines rare and unseen
        archive footage with interviews with the surviving cosmonauts to tell
        the fascinating and at times terrifying story of how the Russians led us
        into the space age. A particular highlight is Alexei Leonov, the man who
        performed the first spacewalk, explaining how he found himself trapped
        outside his spacecraft 500 miles above the Earth. Scary
        stuff.</image:caption
