        >Blake is captain of the football team and destined for a career in the
        pro leagues - that is if he passes his chemistry class. But destiny has
        a way of tackling the toughest of players when demons invade his college
        and begin to enslave the student body. A divine angel descends to give
        Blake an invincible suit of super football pads and send him out to
        battle the forces of evil. Unfortunately, the suit is missing one vital
        piece - the jock strap. In order to get it back, Blake must descend into
        the underworld and face the guardians of doom known as The Chainsaw
        Maidens from Hell. And he's got to do all this while studying for a
        chemistry quiz.</image:caption
