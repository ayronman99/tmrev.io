        >Jack Cameron is a single dad that decides not to observe Christmas
        because his wife left him around that time. The ghosts of Christmas past
        and present try and get Jack to relent, but they screw up their jobs and
        send themselves on a wild ride through time showing up at various times
        in Jack's past. As they try and rectify the timeline and get back to the
        real present, some things are not what they used to be.</image:caption
