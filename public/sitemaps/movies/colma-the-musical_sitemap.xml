        >In the town of Colma, just south of San Francisco, the dead outnumber
        the living one thousand to one. Here, one wouldn't expect teenagers to
        burst out in song, or dance around cemeteries and streets. But, that's
        exactly what happens. Best pals Rodel, Billy, and Maribel find
        themselves in a state of limbo; fresh out of high school, they are just
        beginning to explore a new world of part-time mall jobs and crashing
        college parties. As newfound revelations and romances challenge their
        relationships with one another and their parents, the trio must assess
        what to hold onto, and how to best follow their dreams. It's a love song
        to the city, and to the residents who dream of a better (and more
        musical) life.</image:caption
