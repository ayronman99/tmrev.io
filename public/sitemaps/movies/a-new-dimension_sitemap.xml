        >Cindy Crawford returns to the exercise game with her 2000 release A New
        Dimension. She planned the video as a guide to getting back in shape
        after giving birth. Viewers with that same plan should find the lesson
        helpful. Trainer Kathy Kaehler, also a new mom, assists with the
        workout. There are three different segments featuring various levels of
        difficulty. The first incorporates stretching and some movements like
        lunges and squats. The second part is a slightly longer aerobic set with
        simple steps. Workout B ends with more toning and balance exercises. The
        last segment is mainly a stamina test for both cardio and muscle
        endurance. Though the steps are more complicated, they are never very
        difficult. Overall, A New Dimension can be used in parts or run together
        for an entire hour of exercise.</image:caption
