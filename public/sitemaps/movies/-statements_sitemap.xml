        >Why not make a documentary of your vacation? During the summer of 2004,
        Tori Foster travels across Canada to meet lesbian, trans and queer
        women, and this film queer women, and this film takes us on a journey.
        In front of the camera, these women reveal themselves, define themselves
        define themselves and have fun. From the simplest questions to the
        funniest questions to the funniest, from the most sincere reflections to
        the most difficult experiences, they tell us about they talk about their
        daily lives, and we feel as if we are and you feel like you can hear
        yourself!</image:caption
