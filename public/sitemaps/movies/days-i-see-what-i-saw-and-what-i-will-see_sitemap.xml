        >DAYS, I See what I Saw and what I will See explores the notion of
        producing a continuous representation of space and a discontinuous
        representation of time. The film was shot over eleven days, from 24
        February to 6 March 2011, in a Labor Camp in Sajaa, Sharjah, United Arab
        Emirates. Melik Ohanian built 100 meters of tracks to make traveling
        shots. Each day he installed the tracks and then filmed the 100 meters
        in approximately four minutes. The next day, he dismantled the tracks,
        re-assembled them and moved them 100 meters ahead â€“ and film again. He
        did this for eleven consecutive days, shooting both during the day and
        at night. The incremental editing of the daily footage produced two
        singular films representing 1100 meters of space and forty-two minutes
        of time.</image:caption
