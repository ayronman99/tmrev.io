        >After an industrial disaster, the world's food and water supplies are
        contaminated. The rich and powerful retreat into fortified cities where
        life goes on, undisturbed by the starving masses outside their walls.
        While the outside world slides into unspeakable madness, Jacob, an
        idealistic citizen is on his way to the inner sanctum with others
        hell-bent on revolution when their train is attacked. Taking refuge in
        an abandoned house, he stumbles on a warlord's fortified cache of
        weapons and must fight for his life against humans turned savage. While
        desperately trying to hold onto his sanity, Jacob is forced into more
        and more heinous acts of torture and murder to keep himself
        alive.</image:caption
