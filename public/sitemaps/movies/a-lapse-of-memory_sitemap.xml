        >A confused old man, Henry, lives on his own in an old empty building
        that is reminiscent of a deserted palace. Henry hasn't been outside for
        years. The camera follows a day in his life - his simple daily chores
        and his eccentric rituals. Henry looks like a European from a good
        family, but has many Asian habits. The second protagonist is the
        building in which Henry is staying: the Royal Pavilion in Brighton. It
        is one of the best preserved examples of chinoise architecture and
        furnishing in the world. Neither the client nor the architect had ever
        set foot in Asia. In a monologue, a parallel narrative unfolds in a game
        with reality and fiction. Word and image, fiction and documentary become
        intertwined with each other and point across the frontiers of ‘East’
        versus ‘West’.</image:caption
