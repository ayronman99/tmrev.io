        >The story is of Doctor Kingshuk Guha a gynaecologist who is out
        negotiating the purchase of a luxury apartment for himself and his wife
        Rammani and is unable to attend to an emergency because of a traffic
        jam. When his women patient Kavita dies after developing complications
        following a caesarean delivery, her more militant family members hold
        the doctor responsible and smash up the nursing home. Even Kingshuk's
        wife believes he is guilty of negligence. Rammani's struggle with her
        conscience is depicted through her conversations with the dead woman
        whom she has seen lying abandoned on an operating table. The doctor
        hires a defence lawyer but is persuaded by pragmatic but amoral medical
        colleagues to settle out of court. Will Kingshuk ever be able to regain
        happiness in his life or is happiness just a distant fleeting
        emotion...? Written by Windows</image:caption
