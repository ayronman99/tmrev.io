        >The film was shot in 2003 during the SARS period. Completed by one
        shot, including opening and closing credits. Unlike other long-take
        films, the technical content of this film is close to zero. As a "drama
        film" performed by actors, the emptiness of its plot is unprecedented.
        One of the two leads even fell asleep during the performance. Every ten
        years, I would seriously remake this absolutely incompetent film. So,
        this is both my first "movie" and will be my last
        "movie".</image:caption
