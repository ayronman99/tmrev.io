        >Stanley Durall, the notorious director of a series of intense erotic
        dramas, is returning to his debut movie, God’s Lonely Woman, to provide
        an audio commentary for the film’s first Blu-ray release since it was
        banned in the 1970s. It’s clear from his commentary that Stanley
        committed a series of transgressions against his lead actresses during
        production, transgressions which had serious consequences for everyone
        involved – everyone except him. But will he finally be punished for his
        past behaviour?</image:caption
