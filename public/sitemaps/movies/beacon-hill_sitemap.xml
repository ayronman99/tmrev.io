        >The late Irish hero fireman's (Lefty) charming son William M. "Billy"
        Dylan (25) is elected as independent, youngest Massachusettes state
        representative. He joins the Democrats, Congress seat Beacon Hill's
        legendary rooster, House speaker Charles T. "Chick" Mudoon, who trusts
        the customary campaign debt check will reel the rookie in as another
        meek party soldier. However the naive, naturally noble new boy, who
        doesn't hesitate to single-handedly fight off two skinhead gay-bashers,
        has and follows his own conscience. He defeats Muldoon's dodgy attempts
        to prevent a congressional committee investigating state police school
        cadet abuse, which would compromise his deputy, majority leader Spanky
        Reardon. It seems Muldoon's revenged when Dylan gets framed for the
        alleged violent abuse of a two-faced congressional aid. However, there's
        a more devious, ambitious plot behind two abuse cases and a staged
        corrupt payment for a memorial hospital wing.</image:caption
