        >One of the most controversial men of his age, Alexander Hamilton was a
        gifted statesman brought down by the fatal flaws of stubbornness,
        extreme candor and arrogance. His life and career were marked by a
        stunning rise to power, scandal and tragedy. But his contributions
        survive. As Secretary of the Treasury during the tumultuous early years
        of the republic, Hamilton led the transformation of the young country
        into industrial powerhouse.</image:caption
