        >The Osipovs are a very ordinary family from Ulyanovsk. Father, mother
        and son. They are no different from thousands and thousands of other
        families, except that they are happy. They love each other. The sudden
        illness of the son drives through them with an asphalt roller. Parents
        are ready for anything, they lose their home, and sometimes their human
        form, trying to save their child. At some point, even the mother breaks
        down. But not the father. The most ordinary person. A provincial
        carpenter.</image:caption
