        >Set in a Yorkshire milltown in 1957, Ellen Hardy is unhappily married
        but is close to her ten-year-old son, Victor. The family has recently
        moved house and Victor has started at a new school where Ellen has
        become friendly with his teacher, Kathy Thompson, who is keen to
        encourage him at art. As the friendship between the two women grows,
        Ellen's millworker husband, Hardy, feels increasingly alienated at
        home.</image:caption
