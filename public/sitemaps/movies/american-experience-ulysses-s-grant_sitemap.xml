        >As a general, he had fought to preserve the Union. As president, he
        helped to oversee the transformation from union to nation. As a former
        president, he was the embodiment of the very idea of national union, and
        of America's entry onto the world stage. As a dying general, he was the
        symbol of the nation's greatest and most traumatic war. The story of
        Ulysses S. Grant's life, from his first days on the Ohio frontier to his
        last days out-writing death in the Adirondacks, is an endlessly
        fascinating one. Few public figures have ever held a such a firm grip on
        the American popular imagination. Grant was a man whose rise from
        obscurity made him a hero to millions who could see themselves in him.
        An ordinary man who faced and met extraordinary challenges, his
        successes and failures seemed to encapsulate the national character. He
        was so popular with the American public that, despite his two
        scandal-ridden terms as president, he was nearly nominated to run for a
        third term.</image:caption
