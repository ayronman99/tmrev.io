        >Grandma has become a little doddery. And since the death of her
        husband, called E.O., ever bigger gaps have opened in her memory, and
        her disorientation has increased. Director Astrid Menzel makes a
        decision: to take a ten-day canoe trip on northern German waters with
        her brother and the 86-year-old lady. An adventure whose outcome is
        uncertain and which the three travellers have to face anew at every
        stage.</image:caption
