        >Wagga is a country town that loves its sport but is divided over its
        loyalty for the rival codes, AFL and NRL. It's in this setting that we
        find our hero Chase Daylight, whose dream to play in the professional
        Rugby League is falling by the wayside, just like his relationship to
        Brooke. At his lowest point, Chase takes a leap of faith to sort out his
        life. But living this out is a far greater challenge than he imagined,
        especially among team mates who won't let him give up his partying ways
        without a fight. Chase's leap of faith might possibly be the worst
        decision ever he has ever made.</image:caption
