        >Brendon talks about being single and not enjoying it, his failed sexual
        encounters with women, as well as the political and moral choices we
        seem to be given in Western society. He also tackles the subject of
        atheism with his personal take on spirituality, quantum physics,
        pantheism (Nature and God being one and the same), sentience,
        accountability and evolution marrying them all in a conclusive human
        need for allegory to explain it all.</image:caption
