        >An Italian high school student becomes infatuated with a woman he sees
        outside his class window. Her fianc√©e is in jail for being involved in a
        radical movement, and she spends much time in court providing moral
        support. At first she resists the student's advances, but eventually
        begins an affair with him. Their situation is condemned by her family
        and his father, who is the woman's psychologist.</image:caption
