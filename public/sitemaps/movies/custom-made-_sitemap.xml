        >Sisters "Manamo" and "Minamo" live separately in Hiroshima and London
        since the divorce of their parents. The elder sister Manamo lives in
        Hiroshima with her mother, she is a high school student, but moonlights
        at a Japanese cabaret-club. After her mother remarries and moves to
        Yamaguchi Prefecture, Manamo lives by herself in Hiroshima. One day, her
        younger sister Minamo returns from London to visit Manamo. It is ten
        years since they have lived together, and they argue every
        day.</image:caption
