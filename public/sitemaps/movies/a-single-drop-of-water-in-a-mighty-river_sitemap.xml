        >The story opens with Yukiko and her business partner in Moscow
        searching for Russian items for their store in Tokyo. There they meet a
        Russian translator, Nicholai, played by Sergei Nakariakov - a trumpeter
        from Russia. Some months later after they have returned, Nicholai and
        Yukiko meet again while he is auditioning for the Tokyo orchestra where
        seeds of romance begin. Yukiko's father, however, is diagnosed with a
        terminal case of cancer. Yukiko returns home to be with him in his final
        months as he decides not to go through therapy and let the disease run
        its course. Coming into contact with a childhood friend while at home
        Yukiko is left to choose between her old friend and Nicholai, all while
        having to face the emotional struggle of dealing with her father's
        impending death.</image:caption
