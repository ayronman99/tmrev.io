        >Inspired by a true story, A Mind of Her Own tells the poignant and
        moving story of Sophie, a determined young girl whose ambition to become
        a doctor is obstructed by the fact that she is severely dyslexic. But
        Sophie, encouraged by her closest friend, Becky, has never been one to
        give up and, despite being advised by parents and school teachers to be
        realistic and pursue something less academic, she puts herself through
        college and university, in the process achieving a first class degree in
        biomedical science and a PhD conducting research into post trauma
        regeneration of the spinal column which ultimately leads to her
        achieving worldwide recognition for her work and helping to develop a
        cure for paralysis. Written by Owen Carey Jones</image:caption
