        >Poet Simon Armitage goes on the trail of one of the jewels in the crown
        of British poetry, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, written about 600
        years ago by an unknown author. The poem has got just about everything -
        it is an action-packed adventure, a ghost story, a steamy romance, a
        morality tale and the world's first eco-poem. Armitage follows in the
        footsteps of the poem's hero, Gawain, through some of Britain's most
        beautiful and mystical landscapes and reveals why an absurd tale of a
        knight beheading a green giant is as relevant and compelling today as
        when it was written.</image:caption
