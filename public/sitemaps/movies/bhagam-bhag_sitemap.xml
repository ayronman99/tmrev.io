        >Champak Chaturvedi runs a theatrical troupe in India. He hires two men,
        Bunty - a graduate in Arts, and Babla- who cannot read nor write
        English. One has to play the role of the play's hero, while one the
        villain. Both men end up squabbling with each other, as both want the
        hero's part. Then Champak finds out that Bunty has molested the play's
        heroine, Anjali, and punishes him. The group gets a contract to stage 30
        plays in Britain, however, on the day of the departure, Anjali opts out,
        leaving Champak no alternative but to travel without a heroine, but
        hoping to recruit one while in Britain. Upon arrival, Babla sets about
        to find a suitable heroine from the Indian population, but Bunty beats
        him to it and recruits a woman named Munni.</image:caption
