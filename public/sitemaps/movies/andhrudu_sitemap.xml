        >Surendra (T. Gopichand) is an honest and hot-blooded cop. Archana
        (Gowri Pandit) is the daughter of police commissioner. They meet
        accidentally and their relationship blossoms into love. Archana's father
        is of Bihar origin. Parents settle the match of Surendra and Archana.
        When they are about to get engaged, Surendra expresses his reservations
        due to Archana overhearing her father's conversation with his long
        estranged sister on the subject of Archana and Sinha marrying. Surendra
        takes the blame for the destroyed relationship and Archana goes back to
        Bihar to wed her cousin Sinha (Salim Baig). The rest of the story is all
        about how Surendra goes to Bihar and wins Archana back.</image:caption
