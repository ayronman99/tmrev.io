        >College Conspiracy is the most comprehensive documentary ever produced
        about higher education in the U.S. The film exposes the facts and truth
        about America's college education system. 'College Conspiracy' was
        produced over a six-month period by NIA's team of expert Austrian
        economists with the help of thousands of NIA members who contributed
        their ideas and personal stories for the film. This film explores NIA's
        belief that the U.S. college education system is in essence a scam that
        turns vulnerable young Americans into debt slaves for
        life.</image:caption
