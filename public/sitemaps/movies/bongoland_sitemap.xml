        >Seen across the US, Bongoland has received great response. "A true
        treasure," "It is about time," "Well done," and "Thanks" are among the
        popular responses from people who have seen it. Follow Juma as he deals
        with issues that come up when his dream for a better life in America
        collide with realities of everyday life for an undocumented worker. By
        asking the basic question "Would you rather be a well fed slave or a
        hungry free man" Juma contemplates whether to continue chasing this ever
        elusive "American Dream" or go back to his native
        Bongoland.</image:caption
