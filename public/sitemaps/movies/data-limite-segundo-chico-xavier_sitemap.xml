        >UFO experts claim that after the explosion of the bombs on Hiroshima
        and Nagasaki, there was an increase in the number of sightings of UFO'S
        (Unidentified Flying Objects) worldwide. Just over two decades later,
        the Brazilian medium Chico Xavier confided to close friends that when
        man reached the moon on July 20, 1969, happened a meeting with the
        celestial beings of our solar system to check the progress of humanity.
        They decided to grant a period of 50 years for humanity to evolve
        morally and live in peace, without provoking a third world war. If we
        live in peace until the Deadline, humanity would be ready to enter a new
        era of its existence, and magnificent feats would be checked everywhere,
        including our brothers from other planets would be expressly authorized
        to present themselves publicly and officially to Earth's
        residents.</image:caption
