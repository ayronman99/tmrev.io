        >Bunga (Sonia Isabella), ran away from the orphanage because she did not
        want to be accused as a liar. In his flight she starves and has to sing
        on the streets with a boy, meet criminals, etc. She was put in an
        orphanage by her father, Budi (Deddy Mizwar), for stealing and lying to
        her stepmother. Budi died after visiting Bunga. A car hit him. Orphanage
        administrators search for Bunga.</image:caption
