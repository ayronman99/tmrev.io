        >A vampire named Bathor turned an entire village to vampires, stuck
        around long enough to teach them to survive, and then promised to return
        in 2000 years after conquering the rest of the continent. The only
        problem with this plan is that the vampires, although immortal, have
        only a limited capacity for memory. As time passes, they forget their
        utopian society and led by the totalitarian zealot Grando, become
        paranoid, superstitious fundamentalists, splitting their society by race
        and gender lines, seeking to destroy those who are deemed sinful.
        Long-forgotten lovers Élisabeth and Fantine find that, with the help of
        those who were banished in the past, it is their fate to piece together
        the past and help preserve the little that remains before Bathor’s
        impending return.</image:caption
