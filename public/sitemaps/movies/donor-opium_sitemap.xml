        >For twenty years now the international donor community has financially
        supported Palestinian institution-building, infrastructure development,
        the economy, public employees' salaries, health and education, social
        welfare, the police, electricity production, private credit guarantees,
        and the bigger part of the civil society organizations with regards to
        democracy promotion, human rights, tolerance, women rights etc. Peace
        and the establishment of a Palestinian state have been the declared
        goals of all the support. But actual results are the fragmentation and
        pacification of the Palestinian people. This documentary film, directed
        by Mariam Shahin and George Azar, and funded by the Rosa Luxemburg
        Foundation, features Palestinian criticism of this externally funded
        "development".</image:caption
