        >Stephen is a brilliant young boy who lives in England, in what appears
        to be the 1920s—but nothing in Stephen’s life is quite as it seems. His
        world is turned upside down upon meeting a charismatic and inspirational
        professor at a garden party, who demonstrates to Stephen and his friends
        what life would be like if they themselves were merely one, or two,
        dimensional beings. He then proceeds to explain that by manipulating
        other dimensions, time travel may actually be possible. As Stephen’s
        life unfolds, events lead him to dedicate himself to turning the
        Professor’s theories of time travel into reality. Jealousy, love,
        obsession, temptation and greed surround him, influencing his fragile
        mind and the direction of his work.</image:caption
