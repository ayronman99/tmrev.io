        >Kati and Steffi have been best friends since they were six. Now they're
        both 17 and enjoying the ups and downs of becoming adults together.
        While Kati's parents are religious and conservative, but argue
        constantly, Steffi comes from what appears to be a harmonious and
        liberal family. But the girls discover how quickly their attractive
        world can fall apart when, at a hip nightclub, they happen to see
        Steffi's father in the arms of another woman. Steffi is shocked, her
        trust in her small perfect world shaken to the core. She can only think
        of one thing: revenge.</image:caption
