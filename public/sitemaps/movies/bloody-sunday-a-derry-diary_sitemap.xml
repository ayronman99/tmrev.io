        >On January 30, 1972 in Derry, Northern Ireland, the British army fired
        on a peaceful civil rights demonstration killing thirteen people. During
        the ensuing trial, Widgery, the prosecutor at the High Court of Justice,
        exonerated the soldiers involved from all responsibility and dragged the
        dead and wounded through the mud, calling them, in particular, dangerous
        bombers. In 1998, a new trial opened to shed light on this event now
        known as the "Bloody Sunday". This documentary follows this trial over
        five years from the point of view of the families of the victims, in
        perpetual displacement between Derry and London. The director herself
        witnessed the events of the time and was heard by this tribunal which is
        expected to rule in 2007.</image:caption
