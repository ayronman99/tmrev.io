        >Apolônio Brasil was a pianist at a famous nightclub in Rio de Janeiro,
        from the 1950s until his untimely death. Quite a character, Apolônio was
        loved by women and idolized by his audience and friends. His contagious
        joy attracts the attention of American scientist Dr. Boris Lewitsky, who
        comes to Brazil in order to interview Apolônio's close friends and make
        them a most unusual offer concerning the remains of the late
        musician.</image:caption
