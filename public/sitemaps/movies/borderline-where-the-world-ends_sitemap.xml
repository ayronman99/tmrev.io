        >One hour’s drive away from Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, all those
        leaving the “free West” towards Belarus, “the last dictatorship in
        Europe”, must pass through strict border control. Crossing this border
        is a time-consuming and almost absurd performance. However, there are
        people who are confronted with this border on a daily basis as it
        literally cuts right through their backyard. What used to be a daily
        routine of visiting relatives or friends, going to church or to the
        cemetery, has now become a complicated process involving cross point
        schedules, visas and other complex bureaucratic
        procedures.</image:caption
