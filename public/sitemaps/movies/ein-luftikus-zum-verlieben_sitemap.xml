        >Management consultant Max Tanner is an airman as he stands in the book.
        This painful experience must make his new friend Anna, as she caught him
        just on her birthday with another. In her anger, Anna cursed him with
        the words "From now on you are air!" And indeed, from that moment Max is
        invisible to all the world. For Max, who was used to everything
        revolving around him, a situation as unpleasant as it was instructive.
        After the first shock, however, he does everything possible to become
        visible again and to recapture Anna's heart.</image:caption
