        >Vergleich Ã¼ber ein Drittes is about the concept of work, as reflected
        in the example of the manufacture and processing of bricks. Harun
        Farocki shows working procedures in traditional, newly industrializing,
        and highly industrialized societies. The seated woman worker was filmed
        in India. There follows footage of brick manufactoring in Mumbai,
        Nimbut, and Pune in single and double projections, as well as images
        shot in industrialized Europe that jump back and forth or are projected
        side by side. After this initial presentation of increasingly automated
        manufacturing processes, the subsequent work steps in the various
        lacations and societies are related to one another in a series of
        different constellations.</image:caption
