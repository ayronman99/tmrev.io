        >All this unlucky guy wanted was to make a no-budget film. But
        everything went wrong. Actors quit and there isn't even a camera
        anymore. He finds an envelope in his postbox which contains a letter and
        a black pill. The anonymous sender writes that the addressee left the
        black pill at his place and then wishes him goodbye forever. Our unlucky
        guy needs some drinks. As he is leaving the flat he contemplates the
        black pill sitting on the table. In a split second he swallows it down.
        He finally leaves the house, but what is now happening? Could it be that
        this will be his last night on earth? What about these fragments and
        visions that seem to be connected in some way to his failed film
        project?</image:caption
