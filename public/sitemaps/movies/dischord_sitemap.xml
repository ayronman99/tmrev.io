        >On the brink of her world tour, at the height of her success,
        alternative rock violinist, Gypsy, put down her violin and walked
        away... A man brutally beats his girlfriend to death and tosses her
        remains into a local river... A retired Boston PD detective isn't buying
        the news report of a local girl accidentally drowning... While Gypsy's
        unprecedented disappearance perplexes the entire music industry, she
        retreats with her husband to the desolation of Cape Cod in winter...
        Seeking refuge in his past, the murderer contacts his estranged brother
        and falls in love with his brother's wife, Gypsy... And then a body
        turns up on Cape Cod... And the detective isn't convinced that this will
        be the last... Here, in the smallest quietest corner of New England
        unfolds a disquieting tale of what happens when music meets murder...
        and a lyrical portrait of the ever-present guardians who preserve life's
        natural harmony.</image:caption
