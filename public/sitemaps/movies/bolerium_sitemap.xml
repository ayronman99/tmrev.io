        >"Bolerium" captures a day-in-the-life at one of America's most
        important independent bookstores - Bolerium Books - run from a hidden
        location in the heart of San Francisco's immigrant/radical Mission
        District. This 23 minute portrait is a humorous exploration of the
        store, its diverse staff and the wild array of customers who frequent
        its shelves. Filmed in a handheld style, the documentary captures the
        caffeinated energy that has driven this store for the last 25 years. A
        whirlwind of activity, Bolerium Books is dedicated to preserving the
        history of the world's social movements. They house the largest
        collections of Gay & Lesbian, Chicano and Spanish Civil War materials in
        the United States. Trotskyism is the fastest selling section in the
        store, but they have also sold thousands of Gay Pulp novels and Black
        Panther posters.</image:caption
