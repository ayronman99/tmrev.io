        >Set in the beautiful high Pyrenees in south-west France, Damien lives
        with his mother Marianne, a doctor, while his father, a pilot, is on a
        tour of duty abroad with the French military. At school, Damien is
        bullied by Thomas, who lives in the farming community up in the
        mountains. The boys find themselves living together when Marianne
        invites Thomas to come and stay with them while his mother is ill in
        hospital. Damien must learn to live with the boy who terrorised
        him.</image:caption
