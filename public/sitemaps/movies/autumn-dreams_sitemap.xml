        >With plans to leave their small town, teenage loves Annie and Ben
        elope. Their big city plans are halted, though, when Annie's parents
        have the marriage annulled. Ben moves to New York, while Annie stays in
        Iowa to help her family. Fifteen years later, both engaged to their
        respective fianc√©s, the two discover that their annulment was never
        finalized. They reunite to make their divorce legal, but begin to
        reminisce about what could have been. When romantic feelings resurface,
        Annie and Ben must decide if their past love could be the love of their
        future.</image:caption
