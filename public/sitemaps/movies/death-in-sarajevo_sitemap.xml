        >Sarajevo on 28 of June, 2014. At the Hotel Europa, the best hotel in
        town, the manager Omer prepares to welcome a delegation of diplomatic
        VIPs. On the centenary of the assassination that is considered to have
        led to World War I, an appeal for peace and understanding is supposed to
        start from here. But the hotel staff have other worries: having not been
        paid for months, they are planning to go on strike. Hatidza from the
        hotel laundry is elected strike leader even though her daughter Lamija,
        who works in reception, is firmly against industrial action. Meanwhile,
        in the sealed-off presidential suite, a guest from France rehearses a
        speech. Elsewhere, a television reporter conducts interviews about war
        and its consequences. Was Gavrilo Princip, the 1914 assassin, a criminal
        or a national hero? What long shadow does his deed cast into the
        present?</image:caption
