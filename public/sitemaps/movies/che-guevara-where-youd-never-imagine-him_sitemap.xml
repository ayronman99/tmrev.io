        >Using archival film and photo materials, Cuban director Manuel PÃ©rez
        paints a personal portrait of Che Guevara, the legend and symbol of
        revolution. Ernesto Che Guevara was only 39 years old when he was
        executed in the Bolivian mountains in 1967. This film tells the story of
        Che's short life: his childhood in Argentina, his early interest in the
        Spanish Civil War, the motorcycle trip through Latin America that
        changed his life forever. Raul Castro and other friends remember Che's
        first encounter with Fidel Castro in Mexico in 1955, as well as his
        involvement in the Cuban revolution and rumors of his disappearance in
        1965.</image:caption
