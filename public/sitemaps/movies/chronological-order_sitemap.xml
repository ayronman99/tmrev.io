        >A guy without many everyday worries finds a door floating in the ocean
        and soon suspects he is being followed. He discovers that it is himself
        that is following him and that the door allows him to travel back in
        time. He sets about trying to improve his life by changing his past;
        leaving himself notes all while trying to track down and correct the
        corrections his future self keeps trying to make.</image:caption
