        >In a rare and potentially fatal feat of cinematic daring, "Dublin
        26.06.08" was shot entirely between 12.01am and 11.59pm on Thursday June
        26th 2008. This audacious cinematic collage offers both a unique
        snapshot of a single day in the life of Dublin and a vivid example of a
        bold guerrilla filmmaking model. The film is an eclectic, multi-authored
        impression of Dublin (within the bounds of the encircling M50 motorway)
        as it lived, died, breathed, made love, filled up and emptied, consumed,
        wept, was rained and shone upon, grew bright and then darkened
        again.</image:caption
