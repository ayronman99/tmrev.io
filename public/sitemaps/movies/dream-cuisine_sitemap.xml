        >Japanese filmmaker Li Ying directs the documentary Aji (Dream Cuisine),
        a portrait of master chef Hatsue Sato. In her late seventies, Hatsue is
        one of the last chefs who honor the traditional cooking style of China's
        Shandong province. She and her husband, Koroku, run a restaurant in
        Tokyo, but she really wants to move back to China where she was born.
        The filmmakers follow her to Shandong, where she does a television
        interview and meets culinary college president Liu Gwangwei. When the
        modern chef can't seem follow her old-fashioned recipes right, she
        decides to stay in China and cook them herself. However, husband Koroku
        doesn't want to change his location.</image:caption
