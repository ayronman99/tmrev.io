        >Every year, Goa, one of the biggest party and holiday hosts to the
        world, welcomes infinite number of tourists. Most of them go back once
        the season gets over. Few choose to stay back, digging deeper into the
        traces of a hippie hangover, or trying to search oneself through the
        incandescent, colorful, trippy shores of Goa. And a few yet, get in so
        deep at the wrong end of paradise, that they are lost forever, in the
        same place, but in a whole different world altogether. The film takes
        one such real-life character - Roy - through a plethora of happenings,
        phenomena, legends, myths, sights, sounds, experiences and thrilling
        stories of the fabled Goan paradise. What happens to the protagonist
        through the bitter-sweet, darkly funny, crazy, trippy journey and what
        comes along at the end of it, weaves the half-fictitious/half-real story
        of our film - CandyFlip.</image:caption
