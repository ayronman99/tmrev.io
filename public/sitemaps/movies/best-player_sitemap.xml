        >After his parents decide to move to a retirement home in Florida,
        professional gamer Quincy “Q”Johnson (Jerry Trainor) must find a way to
        raise 175,000 dollars to buy his family home. After hearing about a
        tournament for the game “Black Hole” with a grand prize of 175,500
        dollars, Quincy enters the tournament, only to be faced with a new
        problem. An equally skilled gamer named Chris Saunders “Prodigy”
        (Jeanette McCurdy) has become the one block in Quincy’s plan, defeating
        him at every turn. So he teams up with his friend Wendell (Amir Talai)
        to try and find ways to stop Chris from entering the
        tournament.</image:caption
