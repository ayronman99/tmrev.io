        >A group of teenage ruffians have been using any means to survive on
        their own in the streets of Chow Kit. But when their friend Tika is
        raped one day, this group of adolescents have to up the stakes and band
        together to seek justice and a solution to the problem or more lives
        will be taken. Meanwhile, on the other side, a former ex-member of the
        Chow Kit group who has recently been released from prison vows to start
        a new life, only to find himself dragged back into the past when he
        agrees to take on one last job for the gang. But when the job goes awry,
        he must choose between freedom and rotting in prison
        again.</image:caption
