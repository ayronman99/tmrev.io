        >Death on a Rock follows a young woman coming to terms with a trying
        event in her life. Lillian’s (Rachael Perrell Fosket) bright outlook—she
        loves her job in a flower shop and has a sweet budding relationship with
        her boyfriend (Joe Von Appen)— is rocked by illness. Days spent in long
        term care at the hospital bring reflection, desperation, and some family
        tension. This vibrantly shot tale follows Liliian’s year of happiness,
        pain, and growth, told through flashbacks and drifting between memories
        and shifting consciousness. Seen through a framework of loss, Death On A
        Rock is a bittersweet tale balanced between tragedy and
        levity.</image:caption
