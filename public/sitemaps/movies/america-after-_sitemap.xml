        >From veteran FRONTLINE filmmaker and chronicler of U.S. politics
        Michael Kirk and his team, this documentary traces the U.S. response to
        the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the devastating
        consequences that unfolded across four presidencies. Drawing on both new
        interviews and those from the dozens of documentaries Kirk and his
        award-winning team made in the years after 9/11, this two-hour special
        offers an epic re-examination of the decisions that changed the world
        and transformed America. From the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq to the
        January 6 insurrection, America After 9/11 exposes the legacy of
        September 11 â€” and the ongoing challenge it poses for the president and
        the country.</image:caption
