        >The ups and downs experienced by the West Coast's Dogg Pound Gangstas
        have been legion, and this documentary seeks to set the record straight,
        tracing the evolution of the beefs, reunions, and lasting relationships
        over the years. Documentarian Damian Zellous reveals accusations that
        Dre stole some of his tracks, Snoop Dogg expounds on Suge Knight, his
        tumultuous relationship with Tupac, and Kurupt, among other things, as
        well as appearing in a live performance. Kurupt's decision to re-join
        Death Row Records is a point of contention and a bone which all the
        members pick.</image:caption
