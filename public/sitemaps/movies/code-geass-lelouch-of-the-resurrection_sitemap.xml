        >It is the second year of the Kowa Period. The world has unified around
        the reorganize United Federation of Nations, and has enjoyed days of
        continuing peace, but now, that peace suddenly comes to an end. Suzaku,
        while travelling as the masked man "Zero" accompanying Nunnally on her
        visit to the refugee camp, is defeated by a mysterious Knightmare Frame,
        and the two of them are taken away. Following secret orders from
        Schneizel, Kallen, Lloyd and Sayoko infiltrate Zilkistan, the Land of
        Warriors, where they are attacked by a mysterious Geass user. There in
        Zilkhstan is a person named C.C., known to the assailants as the "former
        master". In the indomitable kingdom which once conquered even the great
        army of the Holy Britannian Empire, what do the people desire? Hope, or
        despair? The people of Zilkhstan Palace certainly know of Geass. What
        are they, and C.C., planning?</image:caption
