        >A gang of bikers headed by the cool-headed and arrogant Kabir is on a
        robbing spree in Mumbai. They rob establishments and then zip away on
        their superbikes. ACP Jai Dixit is the case in-charge and he recruits a
        bumbling bike mechanic and racer named Ali to chase the gang on a bike
        and help Jai nab them. Kabir accepts the challenge, and pulls off
        another robbery amidst a function. This causes Jai and Ali to call it
        off. Jai resigns from the police force and Ali goes back to his daily
        job. Meanwhile Kabir has lost one of his team members and recruits Ali
        for their final job in Goa. The action shifts from the congested Mumbai
        traffic to the sunny Goa for the final showdown between cops and
        robbers.</image:caption
