        >Childlike Englishman, Mr. Bean, is an incompetent watchman at the Royal
        National Gallery. After the museum's board of directors' attempt to have
        him fired is blocked by the chairman, who has taken a liking to Bean,
        they send him to Los Angeles to act as their ambassador for the
        unveiling of a historic painting to humiliate him. Fooled, Mr. Bean must
        now successfully unveil the painting or risk his and a hapless Los
        Angeles curator's termination.</image:caption
