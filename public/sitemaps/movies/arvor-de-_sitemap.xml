        >Rennes, 2020. The Cinéma Arvor, a temple of art and independent film,
        is spending its last hours in its emblematic building with its five
        columns and pink neon sign. The Arvor will move into a modern glass
        tower, next to the EuroRennes train station. The cinema will expand from
        two theaters to five and enjoy greater programming freedom. Putting
        financing together does not run smoothly; delays pile up on the
        construction site. Nothing out of the ordinary, until the pandemic
        throws the schedule into disarray yet again. The directors shadowed the
        Arvor team for more than two years. As cinephiles, they make this
        history an ode to art and independent film and share their love of the
        theater as a place of communication, encounter, and extraordinary shared
        experiences of cinema on the big screen.</image:caption
