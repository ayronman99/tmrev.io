        >A towboat drifts down the Mississippi River, due for the port of New
        Orleans. The water, the banks, the bright lights of a port ahead; the
        lure of a coming paycheck and a home-cooked meal. This is the world of
        BARGE. A green deckhand following his father into the family business. A
        former convict working his way upward job by job, in the hopes of being
        First Mate. A thirty-eight year veteran engineer in no hurry to retire.
        An ancient waterway pulling a double shift as the backbone of a national
        economy; a tangle of thick steel cables, tied together just right. As
        long as the boat’s moving, they’re making money. An intimate portrait of
        the machinery of American ambitions.</image:caption
