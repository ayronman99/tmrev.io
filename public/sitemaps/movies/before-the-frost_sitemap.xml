        >The film takes place somewhere in the Danish countryside in the middle
        of the 19th century. Here within a small Danish peasant family, harsh
        circumstances reign. With the prospect of yet another tough winter, the
        farmer Jens faces an unbearable choice. If the family is to survive the
        winter, he must settle an agreement with the rich farmer nearby and
        forsake his own moral as well as his most precious possession, in an
        effort to secure them all a better life.</image:caption
