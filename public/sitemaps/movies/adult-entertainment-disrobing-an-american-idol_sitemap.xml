        >A fresh social and political look at the $57 billion-a-year Adult
        Entertainment Industry and its affects on 3 subjects who agree to view
        porn 1 hour a day for 30 days. Shady strip club owners, angry strippers,
        crass porn stars, top-of-their-game experts and 3 unknowing subjects
        hammer out an uncomfortable look into the soul of the porn biz. Director
        Lance Tracy, IMDB (Best Director, NY International Film & Video
        Festival, 5-Telly winner) maturely balances humor, shocking honesty,
        science and entertainment. Is porn really addictive? Are children being
        sexually exploited? Who should teach sex education? How much of
        responsibility should the porn industry take to provide treatment for
        potentially addicted customers? Is porn a healthy sexual arousal tool
        for consenting adults? The film explores possible answers to these hard
        questions, providing an unexpected conclusion.</image:caption
