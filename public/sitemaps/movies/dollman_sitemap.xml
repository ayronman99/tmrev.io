        >Brick Bardo is a traveller from outer space who is forced to land on
        Earth. Though regular sized on his home planet, he is doll-sized here on
        Earth, as are the enemy forces who have landed as well. While Brick
        enlists the help of an impoverished girl and her son, the bad guys
        enlist the help of a local gang. When word leaks out as to his location,
        and all hell breaks loose. Brick is besieged by an onslaught of curious
        kids, angry gang members, and his own doll-sized enemies, and he must
        protect the family who has helped him and get off the planet
        alive.</image:caption
