        >All About Ann celebrates the achievements of larger-than-life Ann
        Richards, who became the first elected female governor of Texas. Her
        cool demeanor, acid wit, and passion for social inclusivity made her one
        of the most powerful and progressive governors in U.S. history, a
        liberal democrat intent on building “the new Texas.” But, when the 1994
        election begins, Richards is faced with her toughest challenge yet, as
        an increasingly conservative majority turn towards a new, pro-business
        candidate: George W. Bush.</image:caption
