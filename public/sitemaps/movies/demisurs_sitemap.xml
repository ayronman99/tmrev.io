        >Lauren, a lovely 29-year-old it-girl, tries to break into the world of
        fashion by skimming Parisian parties. Olivia, a 28-year-old
        psychologist, has two obsessions: to save the confectionery of her
        parents, and to find her ideal husband. At the age of 26, Salma, a fiery
        young history teacher, still lives with her mother in the suburbs. Their
        roads have no reason to cross - until the day when, on the death of
        their biological father that they never knew, they inherit together a
        splendid Parisian apartment. For these three sisters who have nothing in
        common, cohabitation will prove to be explosive, to say the
        least.</image:caption
