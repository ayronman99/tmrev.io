        >Since she was young, Soo-Nam has been able to do anything well with her
        hands. She holds 14 different certificates for typing excellence, but a
        computer takes over her job. Luckily, she finds a new job and marries.
        Soo-Nam and her husband decide to buy a house. They take out a loan to
        pay for their home. Soo-Nam works hard to pay off the loan, but she
        falls into more debt. Then an opportunity arises to pay off all her
        debts at once.</image:caption
