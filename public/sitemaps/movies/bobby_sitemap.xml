        >A film which marks the 50th anniversary of England's victory in the
        1966 World Cup, and uncovers the truth behind the man who led them to
        it... Bo66y is a powerful, dramatic and deeply personal portrait of a
        genuine footballing icon. Moore fought many battles besides those
        witnessed by millions on the football field. Behind the glory lies the
        story of a man who faced highs and lows with the same strength and
        bravery. But he died young, cruelly shunned by the game and by the very
        people who owed him so much. The story is told by his two wives, his
        friends and fans, including Pele, Sir Geoff Hurst Harry Redknapp, Ray
        Davies, Ray Winstone and Russell Brand, and more than 30 others, whose
        words are mixed with as yet unseen archive footage.</image:caption
