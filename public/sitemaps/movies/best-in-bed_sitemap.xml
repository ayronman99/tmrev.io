        >Raised to believe in performance and in the idea that all abilities
        must be optimized, Emma is a young, methodical woman who appears
        determined and relatively sure of herself. But two consecutive failures
        (real or imagined) lead her to believe that she has a real problem: she
        is useless in bed. Because she is more fragile than she appears, Emma
        hence decides to become... the best lay in Paris! She then sets out on a
        formidable plan of action (theory, practical, validation of acquired
        knowledge), which soon provokes a series of misunderstandings and
        disasters within her immediate vicinity. For one thing, her method
        doesn't turn out to be really adapted to her field of investigation. And
        Emma has probably also forgotten a little detail: love doesn't obey any
        plan. In this absurd and nutty quest, Emma will learn to let go, to lose
        control, and, to finally win her freedom.</image:caption
