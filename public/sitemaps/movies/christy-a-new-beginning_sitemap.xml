        >Christy (Lauren Lee Smith) and the rest of the Cutter Gap community are
        just beginning to recover from a typhoid epidemic when a storm hits the
        rural alcove. In A New Beginning, the second of a two-part PAX
        production that began with A Change of Seasons, she gets stranded in the
        forest with Dr. MacNeill (Stewart Finlay-McLennan), and her fianc√© David
        (James Waterston) risks life and limb to rescue her. Despite a loss of
        property, the town makes it through the storm relatively intact, but
        many have been changed by the experience. Christy, for instance, has
        come to see Dr. MacNeill in a new light, thus questioning her engagement
        to David. Will she marry the preacher or break off the engagement?
        Marriage is on the minds of several characters in this engaging
        recollection by the elderly Christy about her experiences as a young
        schoolteacher in the Smoky Mountains.</image:caption
