        >The breathtaking underwater world of the Caribbean holds many secrets.
        For millions of years, sea turtles and sharks have successfully shared
        this habitat. Here, sunlight penetrates crystal clear water and casts
        its spell over fantastic coral formations. This new 3D adventure enables
        us to experience tiger sharks, one of the ocean’s most dangerous
        animals, as if they were in our own living room. Sharks evoke both fear
        and fascination. Fast and agile, they glide elegantly through the water,
        observe us with all their senses and raise a number of questions. The
        media describes them as »killers« or »bloodthirsty beasts«, but a shark
        whisperer shows us the true face of these beautiful, enigmatic and
        astounding predators sensitive kings of the seas with unimaginable
        skills and more endangered than we thought.</image:caption
