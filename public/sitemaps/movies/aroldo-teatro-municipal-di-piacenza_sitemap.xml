        >Discover this rare Verdian jewel! Aroldo—one of the composer’s least
        performed works—premiered in 1857 in Rimini, Italy. The work was created
        in response to the censorship of Verdi’s 1849 Stiffelio, whose tale of a
        protestant pastor publicly pardonning an adulterer and his wife proved
        too scandalous for 19th-century Italian society. In creating Aroldo,
        Verdi’s librettist and collaborator Francesco Maria Piave transposed
        Stiffelio’s story and characters to the more distant setting of Great
        Britain at time of the Crusades, and the composer took advantage of this
        new version to add a fourth act to the opera, and to rewrite part of the
        first act as well as a few arias.</image:caption
