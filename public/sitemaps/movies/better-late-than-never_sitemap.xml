        >Catrin wants to know it again: With over 40 she dared to jump back to
        the University of Marburg. The married mother wants to finish her
        medical studies, which she stopped many years ago because of her
        pregnancy. The classmates on campus are relaxed in the age of their
        children. Her husband Frank feels left sitting in Berlin. And after a
        fierce flirtation with an attractive student, her marriage is finally in
        crisis. Nevertheless, Catrin is determined to make her dream come true.
