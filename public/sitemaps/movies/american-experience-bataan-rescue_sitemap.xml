        >This is the story of a group of 514 prisoners of war from the Bataan
        Death March and how they were rescued near the end of the war. The
        reason this was so important is that the Japanese high command was
        ordering the execution of all prisoners when it appeared that the camps
        were soon to be liberated. So, in the case of this camp, it meant a
        covert operation well behind enemy lines in order to get to the guys
        before it was too late. The episode consists of many, many
        interviews--including several living POWs, a Philippino partisan,
        members of the assault team, their second in command and some
        historians.</image:caption
