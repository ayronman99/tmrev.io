        >Some people think: the process of planning and preparing for a bicycle
        tour is a long and complicated undertaking that requires months of
        research and years of physical training. The reality is: Bicycle touring
        is easy… as long as you know what to pack, how to plan out your route,
        and how to schedule out your days. If you’re the type of person that
        learns by seeing (rather than reading)… and you’d like to learn the
        basics of bicycle touring as fast as humanly possible, then Bicycle
        Touring: The Movie is exactly what you’ve been looking
        for.</image:caption
