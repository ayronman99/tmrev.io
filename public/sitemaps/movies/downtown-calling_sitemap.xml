        >In the late 1970s, the "greatest city in the world" was teetering on
        the edge of total chaos. A failed economy, crime and en mass housing
        corruption gave way to a city in crisis. Yet out of the economic and
        social strife that held the "Big Apple" hostage, a family of homegrown
        cultures that would forever change the world began to emerge. Downtown
        Calling not only documents, in detail, the evolution of New York City's
        fertile music and art subculture during this period, but how its
        collective output continues to play a prominent, driving role in the
        international fashion, art and music industries today.</image:caption
