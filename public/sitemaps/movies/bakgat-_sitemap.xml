        >Rugby hero, Wimpie Koekemoer, and his wild friends return to our
        screens in the third instalment of the successful Bakgat! movies. Newly
        engaged couple, Wimpie and Katrien, move to London where Wimpie has
        received a contract to play rugby. However, he has to face stark reality

        only an illusion. His apartment is everything but the palace he had
        imagined - and his teammates make his life unbearable from the get
        go.</image:caption
