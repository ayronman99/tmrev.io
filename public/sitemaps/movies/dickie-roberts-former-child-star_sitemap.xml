        >TV child star of the '70s, Dickie Roberts is now 35 and parking cars.
        Craving to regain the spotlight, he auditions for a role of a normal
        guy, but the director quickly sees he is anything but normal. Desperate

        and assume the identity of an average, everyday kid.</image:caption
