        >A small group of impoverished Tanzanian women leave their remote
        villages to road trip together on safari. These women have never been
        further than a few miles from their homes, let alone seen an elephant or
        a giraffe... but now things are different. Their lives have been forever
        changed from a simple micro loan. All the song and spirit on the bus
        prove that this is more than a much needed (and unheard of) "girls day
        out," it's also a triumph of the spirit.</image:caption
