        >A young Queensland geologist, Dr Unwins, has quite possibly made one of
        the most significant biological discoveries of the last 100 years. Ten
        times smaller than any known living creature, her so called nanobes
        could hold the key to the origin of life on earth. These tiny creatures
        appear to eat plastic, may have come from outer space and have been
        linked with cancer. In 1998, mysterious 'organisms' were found in
        petroleum drilling samples. These tiny entities survived for millions of
        years in solid rock, two kilometers deeper into the Earth's crust than
        any recorded life. When exposed to oxygen and nutrients, they grow,
        reproduce, organise to form colonies and contain the master molecules of
        life - DNA.</image:caption
