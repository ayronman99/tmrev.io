        >A wealthy couple (James Brolin and Deidre Hall) are killed on their
        yacht off the coast of a secluded South American island called Palmyra.
        The suspects are a hippyish pair (Hart Bochner and Rachel Ward) whom the
        rich folks had befriended. Itâ€™s fairly clear that the hippies were
        involved in the crime: The question is, did the man do it while the girl
        looked on helplessly, or was she a willing accomplice?</image:caption
