        >It’s 1942, and Portugal languishes under dictatorship and WWII rages
        just beyond its borders. Secrets, half-truths, and mistrust prevail in
        the state security office of chief inspector Varga, who makes
        professional privilege a cover for his unprofessional interest in a
        boldly carnal refugee and her alleged brother. Director/writer Saboga
        (screenwriter for Raúl Ruiz’s MYSTERIES OF LISBON) saturates the dark
        world of this predatory tale with steamy eroticism and paranoia,
        starting with the incestuous desires of his bi-curious adolescent
        daughter and including the family maid.</image:caption
