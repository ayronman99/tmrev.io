        >Employed with HMTV, Pavan/Abhimanyu lives in Hyderabad and is in
        constant touch with his retired father, Krishnamurthy, and mother. His
        boss, Sudarshan Babu, hires a Creative Consultant, Surya/Prabhakar Garu,
        their TV channel undergoes a number of changes, and he gets to interview
        various people. He meets with Anjali, an employee with Airtel, and both
        dramatically fall in love. While investigating corrupt politicians, he
        comes across evidence and decides to join the gang of a gangster named
        Bada. Still involved in gathering evidence, his world will come crashing
        around him when he will be told that his parents and many others have
        been killed after their bus was torched by hooligans. He sets out to
        also trace who was responsible behind their killing - not knowing that
        his life is also in danger.</image:caption
