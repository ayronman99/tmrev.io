        >By 1933, Prohibition has proven a booming enterprise, where average
        citizens break the law, hide in the shadows and operate at night. The
        new world order has even lined the pockets of corrupt cops like Jack
        Malone. He collects a 'luxury tax' from every bootlegger and scofflaw in
        the small town he has sworn to protect. While shaking down the newest
        speakeasy in the local underground, Jack and his men uncover a clan of
        vampires hell bent on taking over the town. Now Chesterfield, an ancient
        vampire, and his horde must hide their secret at any cost. The bloody
        result leaves several bodies and innocent townsfolk taken as lambs to
        await the slaughter. With nowhere else to turn, Jack joins forces with a
        busboy and a crazy preacher to save the town and make a final stand
        against Chesterfield and his vampires.</image:caption
