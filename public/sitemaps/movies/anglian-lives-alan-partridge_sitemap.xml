        >A documentary on the life and career of Norwich's finest broadcaster,
        Alan Gordon Partridge. In the programme Alan is asked tough questions
        about his divorce, Toblerone addiction and his autobiography 'Bouncing
        Back' by formidable interviewer Ray Woollard. The documentary will show
        rare and previously unseen footage of Alan broadcasting on Radio
        Norwich, commentating on sport and reading extracts from his book. He
        also talks candidly about the state of television today, his hatred of
        London and his three rules for life.</image:caption
