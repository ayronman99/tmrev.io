        >From falsehood to mystification to manipulation and false impartiality,
        the whole logic of disinformation and brutality is brought to light.
        When the king of the media and his politico-journalistic buffoons are
        sifted by a radical counter-audiovisual power, the discredit of the
        "elites" sanctioned by the referendum of May 29, 2005 is better
        understood. With this film, Zalea TV's team had decided to laugh about
        it and make them laugh, even if at bottom these discoveries were rather
        disturbing. By staging a series of very simple techniques of
        "self-defense", this film is an invitation to self-disengage
        permanently. The use of the TV-B Gone, an instrument whose sole function
        is to turn off the television, appears here as the ultimate resort to
        media criticism.</image:caption
