        >Miha, a poet whom no one takes seriously, earns his living by writing
        cheap advertising slogans. This outsider poet of the new age gets
        commissioned to write an ode to the famous Slovene poet Preseren, for
        the occasion of the national celebration, due to the 200th anniversary
        of Preseren's birth. Who was Preseren, what did he drink and what sort
        of woman did he like? A comedy can begin.</image:caption
