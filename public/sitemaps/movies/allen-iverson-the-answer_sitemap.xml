        >Philadelphia 76ers star guard Allen Iverson is in many ways the fantasy
        of armchair hoopsters, and I readily cop to being one. We know that
        we're not as intimidating a presence as Shaquille O'Neal, or lack the
        lanky moves and wingspan of Kobe Bryant, or just the general gigantism
        of Dikembe Mutombo or Tim Duncan or Chris Webber. But at six feet and
        160 pounds, Iverson is the little man's dream, the undersized player who
        is both fearless and successful in taking it to the big men.
        Unfortunately, Allen Iversonâ€”The Answer isn't nearly as dynamic as its
        subject, though it works well as an extended highlight
        reel.</image:caption
