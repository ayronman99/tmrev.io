        >Young writer Sam has a crush on Birdie, the cute and quirky barista at
        his local coffee shop. When his conventional attempts to woo her crash
        and burn, he takes his efforts online, creating an Internet profile
        embellished with all of the details that would make him Birdieâ€™s dream
        guy. When the harebrained scheme is a surprise success and Birdie falls
        for his exaggerated alter ego, Sam must keep up the act or lose his
        dream girl forever.</image:caption
