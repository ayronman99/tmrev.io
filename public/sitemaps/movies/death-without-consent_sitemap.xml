        >Chris Carrington looses his father to hereditary kidney disease. He is
        painfully aware he may die from it as well. While dealing with the agony
        of his loss, Chris is unexpectedly contacted by a mysterious Russian
        immigrant who tells him his father did not die from natural causes. That
        his father was an unwitting victim of human experiments in the
        development of biological weapons. Pursuing the truth behind this
        strange revelation, Chris learns of Dr. Gurevich, the scientist who
        created these viruses. He meets Gurevich's beautiful daughter Anna,
        whose innocence, charm and intelligence ultimately become his greatest
        obstacle. Unable to contact his Russian informant, unable to decipher
        Russian documents, unwilling to use Gurevich's daughter as a pawn, Chris
        struggles to fight symptoms of his own disease, caught between the
        ticking clock of his own illness and the consuming desire for
        truth.</image:caption
