        >A group of men in their sixties that spend the August nights in Athens
        outside a pharmacy during night shift, an ambulance driver who has an
        affair with a younger girl, a middle-aged couple who have invented a lie
        to renew their passion for one another, a child pretending to sleepwalk
        in the streets of Athens, two younger people who are tied together in an
        office after a burglar attack, and other amorous encounters during the
        same night.</image:caption
