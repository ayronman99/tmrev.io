        >In a small city of Brazil, Flor (a very good looking woman) marries
        Vadinho, a very handsome and erotic man. Once married she finds he is a
        good-for-nothing. She works teaching cooking to her neighbours but he
        takes all her money to gamble. One day he dies. Flor misses the goods of
        the marriage so she marries again with a very correct gentleman – the
        owner of the drugstore (Teodoro). Now she’s very happy with her man, but
        misses the erotic moments with her previous husband. Then the ghost of
        Vadhino comes to earth to chase her.</image:caption
