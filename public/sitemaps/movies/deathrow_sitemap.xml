        >A neglected and unloved orphan raised by poor relatives in the slums of
        Manila is wrongfully convicted of murder that resulted from a heist he
        was compelled to join. Unable to prove his innocence and his minor age,
        he is thrown into the cruel, perilous and horrifying world of death row
        where he is introduced to other inmates all awaiting their execution by
        lethal injection. One of them is a 70-year-old man who detests the
        jungle of jail and is feared by all the convicts. He would serve as the
        boy’s protector and savior and in the process touch and shape enormously
        the violated youth’s life in prison and beyond.</image:caption
