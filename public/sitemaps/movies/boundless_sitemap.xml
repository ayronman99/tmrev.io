        >As Hong Kong's foremost filmmaker, Johnnie To himself becomes the
        protagonist of this painstaking documentary exploring him and his
        Boundless world of film. A film student from Beijing and avid Johnnie To
        fan, Ferris Lin boldly approached To with a proposal to document the
        master director for his graduation thesis. To agreed immediately and
        Lin's camera closely followed him for over two years, capturing the man
        behind the movies and the myths. The result is Boundless, a candid
        profile of one of Hong Kong's greatest directors and a heartfelt love
        letter to Hong Kong cinema.</image:caption
