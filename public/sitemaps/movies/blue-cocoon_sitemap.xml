        >Blue Cocoon follows the story of Cynthia, a woman who lives alone,
        isolated from the outside world. Her day-to-day routine involves
        listening to an old grammar phone and the catching and killing of
        butterflies in vicious traps that hang from her window. One day, this
        routine is disrupted as a curious young girl enters her garden
        unexpectedly. Cynthia is besotted by the girlsâ€™ grace, youth and beauty
        and in her deranged, intoxicated state, decides to kidnap her using the
        chloroform that she uses on her butterflies, and on herself
        recreationally.</image:caption
