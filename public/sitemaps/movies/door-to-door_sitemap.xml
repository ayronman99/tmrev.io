        >Sometimes the true heroes in our lives are those people who inspire us
        not with their superhuman accomplishments but simply by their refusal to
        give up in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds and the dignity in
        which they go about their lives. Bill Porter is one of those heroes.
        Born with cerebral palsy, he was told for many years that he was
        unemployable. But with the unwavering support of a dedicated mother and
        an indomitable spirit that has become his trademark, Porter did support
        himself as a door-to-door salesman in Portland, Ore.</image:caption
