        >High school student Jung-Won (Cha Ye-Ryeon]) works at an amusement
        park, dressed up as Dragon cartoon character. Then one day, a guy,
        standing among his friends, twists her dragon mask around, causing her
        to fall flat on her back. Shortly afterwards, she spots the guy that
        caused her to fall down. Jung-won proceeds to pour a drink over his
        head. A few days later Jung-Won is horsing around with her brother on
        the top floor of their home. They notice that a new family moved in next
        door. Jung-Won then gets a sickening feeling when she realizes that the
        young guy in their family is the same guy that twisted her dragon mask
        around in the amusement park. His name is Eun-Kyu (Jang Keun-Suk), a
        popular high school student that fronts the band
        “Doremifasolasido.”</image:caption
