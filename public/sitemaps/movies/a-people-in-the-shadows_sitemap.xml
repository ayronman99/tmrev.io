        >Almost thirty years after the revolution, and twenty since the end of
        the long Iran-Iraq war, A People in the Shadows takes us on a voyage
        into the heart of Tehran, a megalopolis of 14 million people. The city
        is still recovering from its past, as talk of sanctions and a possible
        American attack resonate. Using direct cinema methods, the film takes an
        intimate look at the way people live in this immense city today, caught
        up in the paradoxes and contradictions of their society, surrounded by
        images of past and future death, yet finding ways to juggle state
        propaganda and foreign threat on a daily basis.</image:caption
