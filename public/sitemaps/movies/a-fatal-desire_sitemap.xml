        >This melodrama, staged by me and produced with my students at the San
        Francisco Art Institute, follows the turbulent journey of an aspiring
        singer as she flees a frigid environment to heat up a tepid career.
        Hauling along her decrepit mom and an equally cadaverous aunt, our
        heroine falls prey to a variety of libido-inspired stresses and also has
        a tragic debut at a disco club populated by repressed, trailer trash and
        ousted meteorologists. It's a fast moving trip from north to south with
        many odd detours for the viewer to relish.</image:caption
