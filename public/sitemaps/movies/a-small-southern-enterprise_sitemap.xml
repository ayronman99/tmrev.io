        >Mamma Stella is on edge. As if she hadn't got enough trouble already
        with her daughter Rosa Maria, who has left her husband now Costantino,
        her son, has disrobed. Afraid to be the talk of the village, relegates
        him to a distant lighthouse belonging to the family. But Costantino does
        not remain far from the madding crowd for long. It does not take long
        indeed before all the local (or even distant) outcasts flock together
        there: Magnolia, a retired escort girl; Arturo, Rosa Maria's estranged
        husband; Valbona, a lesbian; Rosa Maria herself; and, to crown it all,
        two eccentric workers accompanied by a little girl... After a period of
        chaos, this small world gradually discovers that unity makes
        strength.</image:caption
