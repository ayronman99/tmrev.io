        >At a time when the country is rethinking its drug policies large and
        small, one state raises to the forefront of national attention. Once a
        pioneer in legalizing medical marijuana, the state of Montana is poised
        to become the first in the nation to repeal its medical marijuana law.
        Set against the sweeping vistas of the Rockies, the steamy lamplight of
        marijuana grow houses, and the bustling halls of the State Capitol, CODE
        OF THE WEST follows the 2011 Montana State Legislature as it debates the
        fate of medical marijuana. This is the story of the many lives and
        fraught emotions tied to one of the most heated policy questions facing
        the country today</image:caption
