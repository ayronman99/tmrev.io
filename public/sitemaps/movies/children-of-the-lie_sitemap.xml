        >A week before her wedding, Agathe Plichard, a pretty young woman of
        mixed race, is found drowned in the Creuse river. The police treat the
        case as an accident but her fiancé, Félix Bricourt, is convinced she was
        murdered. He decides to investigate by himself, despite the wishes of
        his family, a wealthy dynasty of the region. Won over by Félix's
        resolve, police inspector Carole Levasseur also decides to find out the
        truth. The murder of an independent journalist changes the course of the
        investigation, stirring up the past and unveiling the forgotten
        "Children of the Creuse" affair.</image:caption
