        >Anne is persuaded to join her fiance, Gilbert, in New York City as he
        begins his tenure at a major hospital. However, any chance of lasting
        happiness is dashed when Gilbert enlists to serve in The Great War in
        Europe. Anne stays behind and takes up writing, but learns that contact
        has been lost with Gilbert. Seeing no other option, Anne decides to
        venture to Europe herself to find him. In doing so, she begins an
        adventure that will challenge her wits and imagination to the
        limit.</image:caption
