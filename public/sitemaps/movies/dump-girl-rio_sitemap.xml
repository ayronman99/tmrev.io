        >Rio is driving her loving dump truck as usual, distressed by the fact
        that her partner Osamu is into gambling, never paying for anything. What
        is worse, there is a sign that she is pregnant. One day, Toyama, who is
        on the wanted list on charge of murder, arrives before Rio. Holding a
        kitchen knife, he orders her to take him to Yokohama, where his daughter
        lives. He abandoned her 10 years ago. Rio was freaking out at first, but
        having told that Toyama is dying of cancer, she tries to help him to
        meet his daughter.</image:caption
