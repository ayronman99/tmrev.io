        >Sara, a pregnant woman, is the innocent bystander in a robbery,
        committed by reluctant criminal, Derek. After being accidentally shot in
        the robbery, Sara loses her child. Returning home, she is shocked to
        find Derek there with a gun, but things are not as they seem. Determined
        to do penance for a lifetime of bad choices, Derek places himself in
        Sara's power, and Sara, who has been viciously abused by men in the
        past, takes the opportunity for vengeance. As they grow to know each
        other, they both will form a lifesaving bond or kill each other
        first!</image:caption
