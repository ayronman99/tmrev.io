        >1960s. Arden is an introvert kid who was brought up in a strict
        Catholic orphanage. Insecure about his voice, he pretends to sing during
        choir practice. With the arrival of Mr. Stevens, the new music teacher,
        his farce is discovered and the duo starts to work together. As the boy
        becomes more confident with his singing, a friendship is formed. But a
        stern Mother Superior notices changes in Arden's behavior and, concerned
        with his attachment to the teacher, breaks them apart. Abandoned once
        more in his life, Arden will struggle to find his own
        voice.</image:caption
