        >Samuel's dream of buying a recording studio, making a hit record, and
        becoming a famous hip-hop artist has hit a snag. The money he borrowed
        to make it all happen is long over due. With the money all gone and the
        record far from finished, he becomes desperate for a solution. So when
        "The Bruce" - unscrupulous business man and owner of a string of male
        strip clubs - gives him only six months to pay back sixty-thousand
        dollars or say good-bye to his dream, Samuel knows what he's got to do.
        To make it all work, he going to take it all off. With his looks and his
        talents, raising enough money to pay off the loan and complete the
        record ought to be a cinch, but there's still a hitch. For his plan to
        work he'll have to keep it a secret for a number of
        reasons.</image:caption
