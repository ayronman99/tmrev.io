        >A documentary about the well-known Latvian youth choir “Kamēr...” and
        its journey to the Tolosa Choral competition. A debut from a 20 year old
        singer of the choir, the film offers a deeply personal insight into the
        most difficult challenge the choir has ever faced. After the head
        conductor leaving, the choir has just 2 months to get used to a new
        leader. A test for the new conductor who has to prove his worth at one
        of the most important competi-tions of the choir’s history. It’s do or
        die, as nothing less than a victory will be accepted. Following the
        choir every step of the way, the director puts the audience in a
        first-row seat at rehearsals, performances, discussions and spectacular
        moments that can only be seen through the eyes of a singer. An
        unprecedented view of the personal battles and achieve-ments, that lead
        up to a real-life story, never captured before.</image:caption
