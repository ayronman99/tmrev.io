        >Kadu Mark, a bright and smart student joins University under pressure
        from his father, Mr Anatoli, a prominent city lawyer who is overjoyed
        that Mark has managed to be offered a law course and is soon to become a
        lawyer like himself. However, at the back of Mark's mind, he is
        disgusted with the whole "Law" course idea because he wants to lead a
        different career. When Mr Anatoli finds out that Mark has quietly
        changed the course, will he sue him?</image:caption
