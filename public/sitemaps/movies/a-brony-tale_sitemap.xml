        >Vancouver-based voice artist Ashleigh Ball has been the voice of
        numerous characters in classic cartoons such as Care Bears, Strawberry
        Shortcake, Cinderella and more. When Ashleigh was hired to voice Apple
        Jack and Rainbow Dash for Hasbro's fourth series to use the My Little
        Pony name - My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic - she had no idea she
        would become an Internet phenomenon and major celebrity to a worldwide
        fan-base of grownups. Bronies are united by their belief in the show's
        philosophy. This documentary gives an inside view of the Pony fan-world,
        and an intimate look at the courage it takes to just be yourself...even
        when that means liking a little girls' cartoon.</image:caption
