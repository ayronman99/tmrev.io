        >Omi, a seven-year old East Indian boy is sent to Ottawa to live with
        his uncle due to his mother's illness back home. He has no father and
        unaware that his mother is likely to die, Omi believes that he is on a
        mission to find a hero to take back to India to save her. Omi connects
        emotionally with Roland, the captain of a local tour boat who in turn
        begins a romance with Safia, Omi's fiesty teenage cousin who is assigned
        to take care of him.</image:caption
