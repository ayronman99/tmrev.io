        >Deepika (Bhavana) is an arrogant rich girl. A medical college student,
        she dictates terms at the college. Sister of local don Kasi (Prakash
        Raj), she is feared by students, professors and even the Dean of the
        College. Enter Aarya (Madhavan), a final year student who comes to
        Chennai Medical College from Coimbatore. A soft-spoken Aarya runs into
        Deepika. They develop cold shoulders. In a fit of rage, she kidnaps
        Aarya's sister. But Aarya faces her challenges daringly. However, she
        soon falls in love with him. But he is not ready to marry the sister of
        a ruffian. The remaining story tells us how the brother and sister put
        pressure on Aarya to become a rowdy so that Aarya's status is equal
        enough as Kasi's status so that Aarya can marry Kasi's sister Deepika.
        Meanwhile, "Snake" Babu (Vadivelu) is elected the area councillor, and
        has a few encounters with Dr. Aarya, and one with Deepika. He is the
        main source of comic relief for the film.</image:caption
