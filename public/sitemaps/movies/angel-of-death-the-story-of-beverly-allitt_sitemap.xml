        >A disturbing docu-drama re-telling the story of the horrific case of
        Beverley Allitt, a children's nurse, accused in 1991 of killing four
        children in her care and harming nine others over a short period of just
        59 days. The judge gave her a sentence of 30 years imprisonment, one of
        the longest sentences given to a woman in this country - exceeded only
        by those of Rosemary West and Myra Hindley. In the role of Allitt
        herself, giving an excellently controlled performance, is former
        "EastEnders" actress Charlie Brooks.</image:caption
