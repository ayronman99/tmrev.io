        >Wealthy big game hunter, Wilson Frields, funds an expedition going deep
        into the Florida Everglades to search for the Calusa: a lost tribe of
        Native Americans. When the team discover the gruesome remains of another
        expedition, Friels admits he is searching for the Calusa's Fountain of
        Youth and its guardian, a mythical and deadly beast. As they delve
        deeper into the Everglades, the bloodthirsty beast begins to stalk and
        kill members of the group and, in one struggle, their leader Brinson
        Thomas is injured and begins to metamorphose into a creature himself.
        His only hope: to drink from the waters of the Fountain. The terrible
        truth behind the Calusa must be discovered if any of them are going to
        get out of there alive!</image:caption
