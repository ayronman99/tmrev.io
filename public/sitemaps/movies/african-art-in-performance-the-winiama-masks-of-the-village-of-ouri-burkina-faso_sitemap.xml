        >African masks in performance: The spectacular masks of the Winiama
        people in the rural village of Ouri, in Burkina Faso, perform to reenact
        the encounters between the village ancestors and the spirits of the
        wilderness. This video emphasizes performance. There are lots of long
        takes of individual mask's performances from start to finish, with
        musical accompaniment, crowd reaction. Professor Roy has taught African
        art history at the University of Iowa for thirty years, and he has been
        doing research in Burkina Faso for thirty-seven years. He recently
        published The Land of Flying Masks: Art and Culture of Burkina Faso
        (Munich: Prestel, 2007).</image:caption
