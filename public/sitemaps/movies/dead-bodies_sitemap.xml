        >The return of a vengeful ex-girlfriend sets into motion a series of
        gruesome events for a hapless Irish bachelor in director Robert Quinn's
        grim black comedy. Tommy (Andrew Scott) had thought he had seen the last
        of Jean (Katy Davis) after their recent breakup, but when she returns to
        stake her claim on Tommy's apartment, the confrontation that ensues
        makes their previous quarrels look petty by comparison. After leaving
        the apartment in the head of the fight to cool his head and gather his
        thoughts, he returns only to find that Jean has died and enlists the aid
        of his friend Noel (Darren Healy) in ditching the body and ensuring that
        no one ever finds out what happened.</image:caption
