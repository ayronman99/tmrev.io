        >This omnibus film brings together three globally acclaimed directors
        from Asia with a common theme 'Living Together in Asia' to depict the
        lives of characters who journey between Japan, Cambodia, the Philippines
        and Malaysia. Brillante Mendoza grapples with the issue of loss of
        national identity and home, with a story set in the Obihiro area of
        Hokkaido and Manila in the Philippines. Isao Yukisada directs a story in
        Malaysia where the Japanese army was once stationed but is now home to
        many Japanese retirees living out their remaining years. An elderly man
        has parted from his family in Japan to live alone in Penang, but when a
        new helper comes to the house, he slowly opens his mind and an
        unexpected bond forms between the two. Finally director Sotho Kulikar
        conveys a beautiful but heart-rending love story between a Japanese man
        and Cambodian woman that unfolds across past and present against the
        backdrop of Cambodia's civil war.</image:caption
