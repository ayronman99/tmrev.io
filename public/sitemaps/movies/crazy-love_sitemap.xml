        >Three 'Bukowskian' torrid nights in the life of a man in search of
        love. Harry Voss, 12, is young and naive. Love, for him, is romantic
        love between princes and princesses demurely kissing each other on the
        mouth. His father is a hero who kidnapped his mother and married her on
        a lonely mountain peak... Later on, he'll do the same. But Harry has a
        lot to learn. He learns about 'being hot' and 'fucking' and about what
        you have to do when you're alone and 'feel the itch'. He also learns
        that there are handsome men and ugly ones, that love can be unfair. That
        one can find comfort in drinking... but above all he learns that man is
        capable of anything - absolutely anything! - to get his fair share of
        love.</image:caption
