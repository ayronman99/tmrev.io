        >A young biologist, Mary Jane, who focuses on lepidoptery (the study of
        moths and butterflies), doesn't have the perfect life; she does however
        have what she considers the perfect son. Tragedy strikes and Mary Jane's
        world is disturbingly turned upside down. Fleeing the troubled "real
        world" she embarks upon a solitary bush project. In the isolated and
        surreal landscape Mary Jane starts experiencing strange phenomena. The
        opportunity to be a mother again presents itself, only it comes at a
        cost for Mary Jane and what's left of her family.</image:caption
