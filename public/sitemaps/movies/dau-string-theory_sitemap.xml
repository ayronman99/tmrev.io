        >Nikita Nekrasov is a scientist, a theoretical physicist who studies our
        world and other possible worlds. He refuses to make a choice between
        mathematics and physics, between one woman and another, as he ponders
        the existence of the multi-universe. At scientific conferences, attended
        by eminent foreign scientists and a rising younger generation of
        physicists alike, Nekrasov gets carried away debating the beauty of
        string theory. He attempts to explain to all of his women – Katya, the
        librarian, Zoya, the scientific secretary, Svetalana, the head of
        department – about the theory of his own polygamy, and the possibility
        of having enough feelings to satisfy everyone.</image:caption
