        >When Spence and Hogan graduate from college, life is bleak. They have
        to work for heinous divorce lawyers that torture them. Spence has a
        girlfriend from hell and Hogan just wants to start his life already. As
        luck would have it, our two young men are presented with an opportunity,

        "Cougar" if you will.</image:caption
