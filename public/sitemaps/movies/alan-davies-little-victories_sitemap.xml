        >Throughout 2014 and 2015, Alan Davies toured his hugely successful
        stand-up show Little Victories to a rapturous reception in all corners
        of the UK, Australia and New Zealand with stops in Amsterdam, Antwerp,
        Dublin, Geneva & Zurich on the way. Following on from his impressive
        return to live stand-up, Life Is Pain, he immediately set about creating
        an even funnier, more personal and hilarious performance. This is
        classic stand-up from a master storyteller at the top of his
        game.</image:caption
