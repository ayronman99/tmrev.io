        >The search for documentation about the sea for a school work will make
        the magic door of Doraemon open and take Nobita to Shizuka, Gian and
        Sueno in the deep ocean. This time our friends embark on a huge and
        unique boat in order to learn about the mysteries of the sea and look
        for treasures. What nobody imagines is that a distortion in the line of
        space-time will lead them to the seventeenth century amid a great storm
        that will make them wreck and where Doraemon loses its magic pocket. No
        time to lose, our friends must find a way out. Will they
        succeed?</image:caption
