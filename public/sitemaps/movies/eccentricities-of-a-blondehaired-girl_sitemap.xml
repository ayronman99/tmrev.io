        >Macário spends an entire train journey to the Algarve talking to a
        woman he does not know about the trials and tribulations of his love
        life: straight after starting his first job as a book keeper at his
        Uncle Francisco's shop in Lisbon he falls madly in love with a young
        blonde, who lives across the road. No sooner does he meet her than he
        straightaway wants to marry her. His uncle, totally opposed to the
        match, fires him and kicks him out of the house. Macário departs for
        Cape Verde where he makes his fortune. When he finally wins his uncle’s
        approval to marry his beloved, he discovers the “singularity” of his
        fiancée’s character.</image:caption
