        >The anime industry of Japan is enormous, with 200 new TV shows and two
        trillion yen in revenue each year. For seven years, soft-spoken yet
        strong-willed Hitomi Saito has climbed the ranks, and is set to direct a
        series for the first time. At the same moment, the difficult but
        undeniably brilliant director Chiharu Oji is set to make his big
        comeback after almost a decade. The hit series that made Oji famous is
        what inspired Saito to jump into the anime field, and her goal is to
        match, and even surpass, his success and relevance. Her chance has
        arrived. Their two programs are both scheduled to debut in the same
        prime-time Saturday slot, and after Saito challenges her rival on stage
        at an anime convention, the two production teams each set out to outdo
        one another, because there can only be one number-one!</image:caption
