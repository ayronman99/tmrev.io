        >Procreation is the social duty of all fertile women, was the political
        thinking during the 1960s and 1970s in Romania. In 1966, Ceaucescu
        issued Decree 770, in which he forbade abortion for all women unless
        they were over forty or were already taking care of four children. All
        forms of contraception were totally banned. The New Romanian Man was
        born. By 1969, the country had a million babies more than the previous
        average. Romanian society was rapidly changing. By using very
        interesting archival footage and excerpts from old fiction films and by
        interviewing famous personalities from that time â€“ gynecologists or
        mothers who were part of the new society - the director revives this
        period of tremendous oppression of personal freedom. Many deaths were
        caused by the mere fact that women, including wives of secret Romanian
        agents, famous TV presenters, and actresses, had to undergo illegal
        abortions. Many women were jailed for having them.</image:caption
