        >Home Minister Nateshan tries to molest Nandini the government servant,
        who files a criminal case against him (a throw-back on the
        Neelalohidadasan vs. Nalini Netto case?). In the mean time her son
        Manikuttan becomes the college champion and is scheduled to receive the
        trophy from the Chief Minister. As chance would have it, it is the Home
        Minister who turns up to give away the trophy. In the course of his
        speech he insults Nandini. Provoked by his words, Manikuttan assaults
        the minister and is arrested, but cannot be traced after
        that</image:caption
