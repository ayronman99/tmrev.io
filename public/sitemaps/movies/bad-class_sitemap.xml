        >Ji-eun has a bad impression of men due to bad experiences with her
        father but her mom Hyeon-ah convinces her into getting tuition from an
        art student. Jeong-woo is surprised at how cold she is towards him but
        at the same time, there's tension between the two. Meanwhile, Hyeon-ah,
        who is afraid something might happen between the two, calls Jeong-woo in
        and suggests something but he confesses his love for Hyeon-ah instead.
        They have fallen into an unappropriate relationship and Ji-eun decides
        to give her mom a surprise.</image:caption
