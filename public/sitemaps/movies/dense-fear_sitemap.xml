        >Dense Fear is about three friends Paul, Billy and Dave who head off one
        weekend for a camping break into the deep woods. Things soon come clear
        that something has followed them and is watching them. That night they
        are attacked by a werewolf and Paul is the only survivor, but there is a
        price to pay one year later as Paul begins to feel the effect of his
        body and mind transform as he had suffered an injury in the attack. Now
        Paul only has one person to turn to for help and that is his
        psychologist Dr. Sarah Sandla. Sandla is skeptical about Paul's crazy
        stories of becoming a werewolf. It is up to Paul to convince her his
        nightmares are real.</image:caption
