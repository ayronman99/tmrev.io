        >Rockford Illinois. Local boy, Logan Lewis, is reported dead along with
        41 others at a house in Los Angeles, CA. The government releases a
        statement blaming a undiscovered uranium mine nearby. The bodies,
        over-exposed to radiation, have been confiscated. The house ruined and
        destroyed. Shaken by her brother's death, Devan seeks answers. She
        recruits her childhood friend, Nate, to come with her to California and
        make peace with Logan's death. Nate, caught up in the conspiracy, brings
        along his friend Brandon to document it all on video. But what they find
        is unlike anything they ever expected, for not everyone in the house
        that night is dead...</image:caption
