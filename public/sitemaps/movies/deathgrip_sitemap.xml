        >For the last two years, Fairclough and Porter have traveled to every
        inhabited continent on the planet with a simple goal: to show the world
        a new vision of mountain biking. Joined on this quest by a collection of
        the most progressive and influential riders that this generation of
        mountain biking has to offer, Fairclough and Porter have embarked on an
        all-out assault on the bleeding edge of the sport's limits. DEATHGRIP is
        a relentless mission to challenge the limits of creativity, technology,
        and the human potential. DEATHGRIP is a creative oasis for Fairclough
        and Porter - a place where the raw expression of Fairclough's riding
        ability is captured with the most progressive filmmaking technology
        against the backdrop of the most visually engaging locations in the
        world. The future is now. #DEATHGRIPMOVIE</image:caption
