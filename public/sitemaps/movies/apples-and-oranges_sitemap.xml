        >Apples and Oranges is designed to raise children's awareness of the
        harmful effects of homophobia and gender-related name calling,
        intolerance, stereotyping and bullying. In the course of a lively
        in-class discussion among elementary students and an equity educator,
        children's paintings magically dissolve into two short animated stories.
        In Anta's Revenge, Anta finds out that creativity--not revenge--is the
        best way to deal with a school bully who makes fun of her for having two
        moms. Defying Gravity tells the story of Habib and Jeroux, two
        skateboarding friends whose relationship comes to a screeching halt when
        one of them finds out the other is gay.</image:caption
