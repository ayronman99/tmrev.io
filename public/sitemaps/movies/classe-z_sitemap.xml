        >First day of last year for the students of a high school science, but
        at school there is something new: some guys have been moved from their
        respective classes in a section created especially for them, the section
        H. Students of the H section are not were chosen at random, are in fact
        notoriously problematic elements, too exuberant and listless. Among them
        is Ricky who is awake and never misses a chance to make jokes irritating
        that it shares on its Youtube channel, Star whose only interest is its
        look and Viola intelligent but always at war with the
        world.</image:caption
