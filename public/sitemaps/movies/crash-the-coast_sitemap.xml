        >A crew of young, amateur surfers put their lives on hold to surf at all
        14 coastal counties in California, in only 14 days. On a shoestring
        budget, they bought an RV on the Internet for only $1,000 and planned
        the trip of a lifetime. They are starting their journey at the Oregon
        border and working their way down the coast to the Mexican border.
        Besides surfing an array of California beaches, they will also be trying
        new and exciting activities they discover along the way. This surf trip
        highlights the positive powers that surfing offers and shows how much
        fun surfing is at any skill level.</image:caption
