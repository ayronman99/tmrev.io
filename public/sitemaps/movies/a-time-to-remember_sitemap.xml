        >It is small town America in the 1950's. Twelve year-old Angelo Villano
        has one dream: to someday sing like his idol, Mario Lanza. His
        grandmother, Mama Theresa encourages him; and his beautiful voice
        catches the attention of the formidable but kind Father Walsh who
        arranges for him to receive formal training. This infuriates Angelo's
        widowed father, Frank, who wants his son to be a steelworker like him.
        Determined to "make a man out of him", Frank forbids Angelo from
        singing. When Angelo is chased by bullies into the path of an oncoming
        car, he recovers all but his voice, retreating into a silent world that
        no one can touch. One night, locked in the church basement, the
        frightened Angelo experiences a spectacular vision, a true Christmas
        miracle, that changes his life. And when his vision and his voice return
        during Christmas Eve Mass, no one can deny the beauty and blessing of
        his amazing gift.</image:caption
