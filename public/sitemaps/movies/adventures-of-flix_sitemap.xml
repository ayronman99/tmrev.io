        >A charming comedy about going on a rather long walk. Félix is a
        laid-back guy living in the bleak northern coastal town of Dieppe. He
        lives happily with his lover Daniel and is a soap opera enthusiast and
        HIV-positive. After losing his job, Félix decides to find the father he
        never knew in Marseilles. Agreeing to meet Daniel in the southern port
        city in a week's time, Félix throws on his backpack and starts hiking.
        On his way, he discovers that family need not always be connected by
        blood.</image:caption
