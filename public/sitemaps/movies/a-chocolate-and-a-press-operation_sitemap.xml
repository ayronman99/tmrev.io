        >In July 1982, a month after the capitulation of Argentine troops in the
        Falklands war with Great Britain, GENTE magazine published on the cover
        a photo of a boy who had sent a letter and a chocolate to an anonymous
        soldier. His letter and chocolate would never reach the recipient, the
        chocolate being later sold at a kiosk in the Argentinian town of
        Comodoro Rivadavia. 38 years later, Gustavo Vidal, the chocolate boy,
        embarks on a journey to reconstruct the story that moved, in its time,
        Argentines deceived by the press before, during and after the armed
        conflict with the United Kingdom.</image:caption
