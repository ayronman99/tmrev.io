        >In order to protect the Chinese Ao Jue and the Invincible War, Jin Ao
        passed the Chinese Ao Jue guide to Hua Yingxiong when he met with
        danger. Hua Yingxiong, who is destined to be an unlucky star, lost his
        parents and wife. He left his children, relatives and friends. He
        devoted himself to practice for 20 years, but he was still unable to
        penetrate the Chinese Ao Jue. In the end, he had an epiphany in the
        battle against Invincible and defeated Invincible.</image:caption
