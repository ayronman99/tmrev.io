        >Dalia and her two young sisters grow up in a pagan apocalyptic cult led
        by an ancient Baltic goddess of death and reincarnation. On the night of
        an important cult ritual, a police raid rescues Dalia as cult members
        flee with her two sisters. Years later, as the guilt eats away at her,
        Dalia finds a potential link to the cult through a prominent and
        despised black metal artist sequestered in the woods. Dalia journeys to
        find her sisters but her quest for the truth becomes a descent into
        Hell.</image:caption
