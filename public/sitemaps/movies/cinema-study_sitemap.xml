        >Cinema Study is a reworking of images and sounds taken from Orson
        Welles landmark film Citizen Kane. The piece breaks the frame into
        multiple smaller rectangles, each with short video and audio samples
        from the original film. Part of the activity of the viewer seems to be
        the activity of keeping track of the images, which pop around the
        screen, and how they relate to the sounds. All of the sounds in the
        piece are in a precise synchronous relationship with the images on the
        screen. The original narrative film breaks down almost completely, and
        becomes an almost pure visual and musical experience. Call it Citizen
        Kane the re-mix.</image:caption
