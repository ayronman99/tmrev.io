        >Behind the fluffy towels and crisp white sheets of Berlin's finest
        hotels is a tale of seemingly brilliant entrepreneurship: A company
        takes the dirty laundry of German hotels to Poland - and brings it back
        clean the very next day. Outside of Germany, labor is cheaper and
        regulations are less constricting. But over and beyond this fascinating
        capital venture there remains the harsh reality of the everyday life of
        the hard-working Polish laundrywomen, through whose hands the white
        sheets pass. While Beata struggles to raise her three children on her
        meager salary, Monika reminisces about her unrealized childhood dreams
        of becoming a doctor, and is compelled to watch her teenage daughter
        Marta gradually follow in her footsteps.</image:caption
