        >A young man living in Dar es Salaam meets an old man who takes him in
        as his son and eventually sends him off to Nigeria to look for his three
        children. The only link to finding them is a set of negative films and
        an address. The story is about his adventures in a foreign land and how
        he finally meets them and reunites them with their
        father.</image:caption
