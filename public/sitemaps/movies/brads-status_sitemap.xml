        >Although Brad has a satisfying career, a sweet wife and a comfortable
        life in suburban Sacramento, things aren't quite what he imagined during
        his college glory days. When he accompanies his musical prodigy son on a
        university tour, he can't help comparing his life with those of his four
        best college friends who seemingly have more wealthy and glamorous
        lives. But when circumstances force him to reconnect with his former
        friends, Brad begins to question whether he has really failed or if
        their lives are actually more flawed than they appear.</image:caption
