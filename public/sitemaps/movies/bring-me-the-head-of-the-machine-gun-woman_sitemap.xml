        >A powerful Argentine gangster uses everything in his power to stop the
        woman that wants to kill him, a sexy mercenary known as "the machine gun
        woman". The staggering sum of cash he offers for her head sets in motion
        an army of hitmen. And also, by accident, bursts in the life of na√Øve DJ
        Santiago, a common youth that will have to steel his guts against the
        underworld, and above all, survive the irresistible - and bloodthirsty -
        Machine Gun Woman.</image:caption
