        >A little girl is born with a tail that expresses her emotions. As a
        child, her parents celebrate their daughter's uniqueness and her tail
        inspires magical make-believe adventures with her friends. As she grows
        up, however, the young woman faces pressure to fit in, and must choose
        between conformity and self-expression. An animated short film starring
        Oscar-winner Cate Blanchett, using a striking collage of 3D animated
        characters and hand-made miniature sets.</image:caption
