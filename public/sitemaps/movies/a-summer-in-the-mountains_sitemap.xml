        >Hamburg boy Leo Vandenbroek is not amused when his mother, ER surgeon
        Pia, drags him to a godforsaken Bavarian village for her 'long overdue
        relaxing holiday'. In fact she rented from local doctor Peter Huber
        because he's married to Maria, who she learned in her recently deceased
        father's testament to be her illegitimate half-sister. Leo, who misses
        his daddy since Pia's career ruined her marriage, instantly bonds with
        Peter, and ultimately even becomes the glue to reconcile him with his
        father Karl, who is embittered since his wife's fatal
        disease.</image:caption
