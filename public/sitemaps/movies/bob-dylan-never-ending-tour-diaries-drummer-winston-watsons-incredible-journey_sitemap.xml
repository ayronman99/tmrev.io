        >Drummer Winston Watson performed 400 shows with Bob Dylan over five
        years, traveling the world 10 times over. Watson energized Dylan fans
        and Bob Dylan himself with his joyful and dynamic drumming style, as he
        helped launch Dylan's "Never Ending Tour" in 1992 that continues to this
        day. Winston Watson chronicled his incredible 5-year journey with Bob
        Dylan in daily personal diaries and in home video footage with his Video
        8 camera. Now Watson shares it all in a never-before-told insider
        account, revealing behind-the-scenes details of the thrilling and
        challenging journey as drummer for the legendary Bob Dylan. A skilled
        storyteller, Watson paints an intimate portrait of Bob Dylan's band,
        life on tour, Dylan's music, and the mercurial, brilliant Bob Dylan
        himself.</image:caption
