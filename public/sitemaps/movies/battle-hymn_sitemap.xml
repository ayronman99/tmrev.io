        >Battle Hymn was inspired by the true story of American minister Dean
        Hess, played here with rare sensitivity by Rock Hudson. A bomber pilot
        during World War II, Hess inadvertently releases a bomb which destroys a
        German orphanage. Tortured by guilt, Hess relocates in Korea after the
        war to offer his services as a missionary. Combining the best elements
        of Christianity and Eastern spiritualism, Hess establishes a large home
        for orphans. The preacher's efforts are threatened when the Korean
        "police action" breaks out in 1950.</image:caption
