        >Gru, one of the world's greatest villains and fathers, has invented a
        new weapon, the Minion Gun, a machine capable of turning ordinary humans
        into Minions. He has let his three daughters (Margo, Edith and Agnes) in
        charge of training some guests. However, because of a distraction in the
        middle of the training, the Minion-transformed riders, along with Gru
        and his daughters are forced to recover Agnes' one-year anniversary
        adoption gift for Gru in the depths of his own
        laboratory.</image:caption
