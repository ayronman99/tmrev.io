        >Dante's Hell Animated is a real and truthful epic animation film that
        embarks Dante Alighieri's journey through the first part of the
        afterlife, Hell. It is a compelling four-quadrant film presented circle
        by circle in a chronological descent to the center of Hell, and to the
        exit into Purgatory. Dante's Hell Animated comes in two versions, one
        recited in primitive Italian in Dante's own words, and another narrated
        in English better understanding in this non-original language. Dante is
        guided by his hero Virgil through each circle of Hell and their
        subdivisions until they reach the center of the Earth and escaped to the
        other hemisphere into Purgatory. It features over 50 original color
        illustrations from the upcoming Dante's Hell comic book and magazine
        series, put together in a series of animation clips that will delight
        young and mature audiences.</image:caption
