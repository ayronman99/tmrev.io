        >Annie Cooper has big shoes to fill when she takes over as CEO of her
        late grandmother’s small-town cookie company and is doing her best to
        help their struggling business get back on track. That task gets more
        daunting when her grandmother’s secret recipe is stolen during the
        Christmas party. As Annie tries to crack the case and uncover the
        culprit she works with Sam, the owner of a local bakery, to recreate the
        recipe in the hope of saving the company and her job. As Annie and Sam
        bake batch after batch in pursuit of the perfect one, they begin to
        learn that their lives go together like milk and cookies.</image:caption
