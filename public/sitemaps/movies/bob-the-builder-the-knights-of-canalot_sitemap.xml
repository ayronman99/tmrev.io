        >When an old castle needs repairs, it's time to call Bob the Builder!
        Unfortunately a case of mistaken identity puts Bob's father in charge,
        resulting in one disaster after another! Meanwhile, tales of Camelot
        inspire Bob's noble crew of machines - Sir Lift-A-Sot, Sir Roll-A-Lot
        and Lady Mix-A-Lot - in their quest to get the job done. And Sir
        Spud-A-Lot finds a suit of armor and a fiery steed almost perfect for
        jousting! Back at the castle, Bob's father is a bit of a royal pain,
        locking himself and Bob in the dungeon and then finding himself
        mysteriously trapped in a maze! Finally, a medieval pageant celebrates
        the grand opening of the castle and a great father-son
        relationship.</image:caption
