        >The celebrated Iranian photographer, Nasrollah Kasraian and his wife,
        anthropologist Ziba Arshi, have documented many unique populations
        living within the borders of Iran. This film provides a fascinating look
        at the Turkmans of Iran, who live in small villages northeast of
        Teheran, near the Afghanistan border. It examines how Turkman society
        has changed over several years. Devil on the Roof captures varied
        aspects of their traditional culture. It shows how shamans treat
        physical and mental illnesses with music, sticks and swords. It depicts
        the women's roles - raising children, working in the rice fields and
        weaving magnificent rugs and clothing. Four years after the initial
        filming, the filmmakers return to the Turkman villages where they find
        radical changes have occurred.</image:caption
