        >Had Judas Priest released just this one album, it would still go down
        in history. Judas Priest was one of the most influential heavy metal
        bands of the 70's. BRITISH STEEL made them a world-famous band. The
        welding of BRITISH STEEL is told in this exclusive program in the band's
        own words, and by their once long-term producer Tom Allom. Featuring
        archive footage, interviews and rare live performances, plus all of
        BRITISH STEEL'S finest songs, including "Living After Midnight",
        "Breaking the Law", "Metal Gods", "The Rage", "United" and "Grinder",
        this is a compelling, witty and exhilarating look at the making of one
        of heavy metal's most artful creations, a true Classic!</image:caption
