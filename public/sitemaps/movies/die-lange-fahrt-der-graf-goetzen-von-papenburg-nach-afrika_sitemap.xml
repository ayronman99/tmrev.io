        >Today the steamer is called "Liemba" and is probably the oldest
        regularly operating liner in the world. Its original owners named it
        after the German Africa explorer Graf von Goetzen. The ship was
        commissioned by Kaiser Wilhelm II in 1913 to support German protection
        troops in the African colonies. It made its way from the Ems to Lake
        Tanganyika in what was then the colony of German East Africa in 5,000
        crates by ship, rail and even on foot. There, three Papenburg engineers
        assembled the ship and received a "tropical surcharge" for it. And when
        the First World War broke out, "Graf Goetzen" even presented itself as a
        gunboat. The film describes the eventful and sometimes involuntarily
        funny story of this floating museum piece from the perspective of people
        whose lives were or are fatefully linked to the ship: Germans, Belgians,
        Britons, Tanzanians. A piece of colonial history and a journey through
        recent Tanzanian history, maybe a touch of
        "Fitzcarraldo".</image:caption
