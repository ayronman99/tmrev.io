        >Suspecting his wife, Indigo (Vanessa Branch), has been sleeping around,
        multimillionaire Winston Thorpe (D. David Morin) pays a private
        detective (Geno Andrews) to spy on her. But he never expected his hired
        man to climb into Indigo's bed and plot to steal his most prized
        possession. Now, he's got two problems: an unfaithful wife who despises
        him and a skilled investigator who's willing to take him for everything
        he's ever loved.</image:caption
