        >The story of Daemonium begins in an alternate universe to ours, in
        which magic and technology coexist with humans and demons. A powerful
        family hires a band of mercenaries and forces Fulcanelli, a wizard and
        con artist, to invoke a demon with the purpose of gaining even more
        power. Of course, things go terribly wrong. The wizard escapes and the
        demon slaughters the mercenaries, with the exception of Razor. He’s the
        one who seals the deal to become lord of the criminal underworld. The
        family kidnaps Lisa, his pregnant wife, and turns her into a merciless
        killing machine and the spear point of their offensive against Razor.
        But she’s not the only threat to the crime lord. It’s only a question of
        time before the demon returns to claim Razor’s soul. Fulcanelli seems to
        be the key to stopping the demon and Razor sends out his band of sexy
        killer robots to find him.</image:caption
