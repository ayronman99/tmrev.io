        >Alice, married for the last 20 years to a taxi driver, works in a
        beauty parlour, has three children, the eldest of whom is doing his
        military service, and a mother who works as a maid in her house. None of
        the three siblings pay much attention to their mother, and they treat
        their grandmother with lack of respect. Alice's life in the female
        working world contrasts strongly with the powerful masculine presence in
        her home. Although she's a good girl, the chance to betray uncovers
        other betrayals she didn't know existed.</image:caption
