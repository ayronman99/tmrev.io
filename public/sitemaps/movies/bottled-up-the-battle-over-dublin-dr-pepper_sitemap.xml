        >'Bottled Up: The Battle Over Dublin Dr Pepper' is a new documentary 120
        years in the making. Our story details the small town of Dublin, Texas,
        which was the first place to ever bottle the soft drink Dr Pepper back
        in 1891. Garnering cult-like status in the 70s by continuing to produce
        Dr Pepper with pure cane sugar as the soda industry switched to High
        Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS), 'Bottled Up' details the events and history
        leading up to the demise of the relationship between Dublin Dr Pepper
        and its parent corporation - The Dr Pepper Snapple Group in 2012. With
        exclusive interviews and footage, Bottled Up provides an insiders look
        at how this relationship fizzled, and the public outcry that continues
        to this day.</image:caption
