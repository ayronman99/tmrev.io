        >It's arguably the most brutal and nihilistic form of music ever to
        assault the ear drums, and for many young music fans, death metal isn't
        just something to bang your head to -- it's a way of life. Whether
        you're a longtime death metal fan, a casual listener, or a complete
        newcomer to the scene, this insightful documentary features an in depth
        look at one of the music world's least explored genres that will educate
        as well as entertain. Presented with absolutely no pre-existing agenda,
        Death Metal follows former Carnivore vocalist Peter Steele as he gazes
        into the black heart of the least explored style in the heavy-metal
        spectrum. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi</image:caption
