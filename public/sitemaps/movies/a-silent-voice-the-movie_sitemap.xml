        >Shouya Ishida starts bullying the new girl in class, Shouko Nishimiya,
        because she is deaf. But as the teasing continues, the rest of the class
        starts to turn on Shouya for his lack of compassion. When they leave
        elementary school, Shouko and Shouya do not speak to each other again...
        until an older, wiser Shouya, tormented by his past behaviour, decides
        he must see Shouko once more. He wants to atone for his sins, but is it
        already too late...?</image:caption
