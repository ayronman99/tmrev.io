        >William G. Wilson is co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous, a man included
        in TIME Magazine's "100 Persons of the 20th Century." Interviews,
        recreations, and rare archival material reveal how Bill Wilson, a
        hopeless drunk near death from his alcoholism, found a way out of his
        own addiction and then forged a path for countless others to follow.
        With Bill as its driving force, A.A. grew from a handful of men to a
        worldwide fellowship of over 2 million men and women - a success that
        made him an icon within A.A., but also an alcoholic unable to be a
        member of the very society he had created. A reluctant hero, Bill Wilson
        lived a life of sacrifice and service, and left a legacy that continues
        every day, all around the world.</image:caption
