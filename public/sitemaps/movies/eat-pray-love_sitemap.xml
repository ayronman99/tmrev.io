        >Liz Gilbert had everything a modern woman is supposed to dream of
        having – a husband, a house and a successful career – yet like so many
        others, she found herself lost, confused and searching for what she
        really wanted in life. Newly divorced and at a crossroads, Gilbert steps
        out of her comfort zone, risking everything to change her life,
        embarking on a journey around the world that becomes a quest for
        self-discovery. In her travels, she discovers the true pleasure of
        nourishment by eating in Italy, the power of prayer in India and,
        finally and unexpectedly, the inner peace and balance of true love in
        Bali.</image:caption
