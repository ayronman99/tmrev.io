        >A murder investigation is flipped inside out in Burak Çevik's second
        feature, a spellbinding and surprising work that questions whether we
        can ever truly understand criminal motives. We begin in the present as
        an unseen narrator recounts the assassination of his lover's
        disapproving mother, accompanied by hauntingly vacant images of urban
        alienation and garish city lights; we then flash back to witness the
        first encounter between the lovers-turned-accomplices, their mutual
        attraction and world-weariness emerging across a sleepless night and
        morning after. Çevik imbues the proceedings with a stylistic confidence
        and willingness to bend the conventions of cinematic form to arrive at a
        complex, gripping double meditation on love and death.</image:caption
