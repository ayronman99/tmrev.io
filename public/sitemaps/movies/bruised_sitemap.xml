        >Jackie Justice is a mixed martial arts fighter who leaves the sport in
        disgrace. Down on her luck and simmering with rage and regret years
        after the fight, she's coaxed into a brutal underground fight by her
        manager and boyfriend Desi and grabs the attention of a fight league
        promoter who promises Jackie a life back in the Octagon. But the road to
        redemption becomes unexpectedly personal when Manny - the son she gave
        up as an infant - shows up at her doorstep. A triumphant story of a
        fighter who reclaims her power, in and out of the ring, when everyone
        has counted her out</image:caption
