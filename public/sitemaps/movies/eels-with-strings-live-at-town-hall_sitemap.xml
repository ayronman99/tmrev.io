        >You never know what you'll get when you attend an Eels concert. One
        year it's vocoders and synthesizers, the next it's gritty garage rock.
        Cut to 2005: Eels leader Mark Oliver Everett, aka E, releases the highly
        acclaimed Blinking Lights and Other Revelations double album and
        assembles his most ambitious version of the EELS yet: a seven piece band
        consisting of Everett backed by a string quartet and two
        multi-instrumentalists juggling lap steel, guitar, upright bass,
        mandolin, saw, melodica, celeste, pump organ, piano, and a trash can and
        suitcase drum set. Having brought this elaborate show to Boston the
        night before, can the Eels get to New York, play Late Night with David
        Letterman, and perform their concert at the legendary Town Hall, which
        is being filmed for a concert film -- all with grace under incredible
        pressure? The answer is yes, and the proof is here!</image:caption
