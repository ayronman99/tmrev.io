        >Kattila Gopalan (Dileep) is a notorious name in a little village named
        Oonjaalaadi. Though nobody has seen Gopalan, people hold him in dread as
        he is a thief who always manages to steal whatever he wants, without
        ever getting caught or even being seen by anyone. His identity remains a
        mystery. Then one day Harishchandran (Harisree Asokan), a carpenter
        happens to see Gopalan for the first time. Gopalan is thus forced to
        flee the little village and seeks refuge in the city.</image:caption
