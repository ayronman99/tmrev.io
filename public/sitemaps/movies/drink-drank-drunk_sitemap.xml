        >Alan is a rich kid looking forward to a busy 24 hours: his birthday
        celebration tonight and attending court as witness in a criminal trial
        the next morning. Gal pal Wendy gets things rolling with plans for a
        night of non-stop partying. Alan's lawyer knows his client's
        unreliability, so he pressures Alan's dependable chum Chris to tag
        along. Chris's friend Sam, an entrepreneur eager to do business with
        Alan's crowd, also joins in for fun and profit. As they make the rounds,
        Alan gets increasingly plastered while searching for his latest
        infatuation, Ayaka. By sunrise, he's hardly in condition to testify and
        even the hangover-curing skills of bartender Cherry prove ineffective.
        As the deadline looms, another solution is sought. In the process, the
        guys discover their twilight craziness provided each with a new
        self-perspective that has intangibly changed their lives.</image:caption
