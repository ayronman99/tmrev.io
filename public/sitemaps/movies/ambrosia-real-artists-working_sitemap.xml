        >Though they produced plenty of hits in the 1970s, the members of the
        pop outfit Ambrosia remained largely out of the limelight. This
        documentary takes an in-depth look at the men behind the music. And
        while their success on their charts may be in the past, founding members
        David Pack, Joe Puerta, Christopher North and Burleigh Drummond have
        remained musically active. Tracks included here are "In My Life," "Time
        Waits for No One," "Mama" and more.</image:caption
