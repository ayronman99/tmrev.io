        >The 24-Hour Race at the Nuerburgring is known as the world's biggest
        motorsports event. More than 200,000 fans set up their camp in the Eifel
        forest and cheer for their heroes in the 210 race cars. Lap after lap.
        Hour after hour. Day and night. It's the stage for great stories. Sorrow
        and joy. Excitement and exertion. Drama and emotions. You will hardly
        find any event that brings the extremes this close together. In the
        thick of things, last year's winner BMW's two cars and 70 team members.
        For months, engineers, mechanics and the eight pilots have been
        preparing for the most important race of the year. The filmmakers Tim
        and Nick Hahne captured it all with their cameras - from the first test
        drive to the chequered flag coming down - and accompanied the BMW team
        on the way to achieving its goal: winning the 24-Hour
        Race.</image:caption
