        >When two half-sisters, thirteen-year-old white-haired Sigrid and
        seven-year-old black-blooded Saara meet for the first time, it turns out
        that their common grandmother has been taken to a nursing home. The
        girls come up with the idea to steal him from there and hide him in the
        attic where they can be with her undisturbed. Everything goes well
        beyond expectations until drunkards, thugs and extortionists intervene
        and the girls have to act decisively to escape from them.</image:caption
