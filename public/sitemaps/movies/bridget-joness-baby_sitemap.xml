        >After breaking up with Mark Darcy, Bridget Jones's 'happily ever after'
        hasn't quite gone according to plan. Fortysomething and single again,
        she decides to focus on her job as top news producer and surround
        herself with old friends and new. For once, Bridget has everything
        completely under control. What could possibly go wrong? Then her love
        life takes a turn and Bridget meets a dashing American named Jack, the
        suitor who is everything Mr. Darcy is not. In an unlikely twist she
        finds herself pregnant, but with one hitch she can only be fifty percent
        sure of the identity of her baby's father.</image:caption
