        >The lovely and promiscuous textile professor Eun-sook has all the male
        professors wrapped around her finger. It also helps that she has slept
        with most of them. Eun-sook is also a member of an environmental
        awareness group. When the popular comic book artist Suk-gyu joins the
        group, he arouses the jealousy of Mr. YOO, one of the other member who
        fears that Suk-gyu will steal Eun-sook from him. It turns out that
        Eun-sook and Suk-gyu attended the same junior high school where they
        share a secret and tragic history. Back then, Eun-sook was Suk-gyu's
        older brotherâ€™s girlfriend. But after Eun-sook decides to sleep with
        Suk-gyu as well, the older brother's best friend dies in an accident in
        which both of them are involved. As the jealous MR.YOO starts to
        investigate Eun-sook and Suk-gyu's past, will their secret be kept? Will
        they get together again?</image:caption
