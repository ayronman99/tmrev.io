        >Columbus' 4th voyage has been a total failure: he has not found the
        westward passage, he has no gold to show, he has lost men and ships and
        his efforts to build a colony have fallen through. The monarchs of Spain
        are not going to restore the rights and privileges which were taken away
        from Columbus after the first voyage. And Columbus will be shamed. Many
        of his sailors who have survived, can't face the journey home. They will
        choose to remain on Hispaniola or neighbouring Puerto
        Rico.</image:caption
