        >The year is 1575 in feudal Japan. Oda Nobunaga's (Kippei Shiina) forces
        defeat Takeda Katsuyori, when Nagashino Castle was besieged during the
        Battle of Nagashino. The next year Oda Nobunada decides to build a
        lavish new castle symbolizing his unification of various factions. The
        castle named Azuchi Castle will be built near water and high enough to
        be seen from the capital city of Kyoto. Director Mitsutoshi Tanaka's
        adaptation of Kenichi Yamamoto's novel of the same name received the
        33rd Japan Academy Film Prize for Excellent Art
        Direction.</image:caption
