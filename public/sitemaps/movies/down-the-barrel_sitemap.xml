        >The essence of surfing is an elusive ideal. Part sport, part
        state-of-mind; an avenue for self-expression, a metaphor for freedom; a
        ritual, a competitive event, a dangerous journey, a dance. Nature
        supplies the power, and with the proper balance of respect and
        resistance, we enjoy the ride. From the North Shore of Oahu, to the end
        of the road in Tahiti. From Australia to California, from Florida to
        France, the world's greatest surfers share their insights, and show us
        how - and why -- it's done. Their skill, and the thrill of the
        experience, are captured as never before in this documentary. What is
        the secret to surfing's global appeal? The answer is revealed by
        Florida's Kelly Slater, California's Rob Machado, Hawaii's Kalani Robb
        and Australia's Joel Parkinson, through their own voices, in DOWN THE
        BARREL. The sport of Surfing is displayed for what it is. WITHOUT
        SCRIPT. WITHOUT ANIMATION. WITHOUT HYPE.</image:caption
