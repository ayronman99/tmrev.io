        >Hyuk and Kyung have their share of marital problems, one of them being
        a stagnating sex life. Kyung again rejects Hyuk's advances and Hyuk goes
        to bed feeling hurt and angry. The next morning, the couple discuss
        their problems and decide to take a romantic weekend trip to add fire to
        their marriage. But when Hyuk fails to perform, they are back to square
        one. The following Monday, Hyuk confesses his story to his colleague
        Woo. Woo suggests swapping partners by joining a secret club called Club
        Butterfly . Hyuk soon receives a mysterious email from an anonymous
        sender urging him to join this illicit club. Neither Hyuk nor Kyung
        knows what is in store for them.</image:caption
