        >At the break of dawn on October 24, 2014, 57-year old Google Executive
        Alan Eustace slowly rises into the air dangling below a helium balloon.
        This ascent is the culmination of three years of planning under an
        utmost secret mission which started as a scribble on a paper napkin.
        Eustace realized that as a private citizen you cannot merely walk into a
        store and buy a spacesuit. He determined that he would have to call upon
        the brightest minds in the country to pioneer a new technological
        invention in order to make his dream come true.</image:caption
