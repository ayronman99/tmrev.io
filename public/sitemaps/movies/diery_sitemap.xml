        >Instagram model Marie Clark is getting her masters in comparative
        religion and moving on from an abusive past with the help of her
        psychiatrist, Dr. Brighton. It seems Marie's life is finally on the
        right trajectory until her diary is stolen and an obsessive fan begins
        sending her love letters informing Marie that they are killing anyone
        who they see as a danger to her. As friends begin to feel like suspects,
        and bodies start piling up, terrifying as it is, Marie must confront the
        demons of her past in order to unmask the killer and reclaim her
        life.</image:caption
