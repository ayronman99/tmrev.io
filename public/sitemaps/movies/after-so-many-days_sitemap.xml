        >After a decade of making music together, Jim and Sam, a recently
        married singer/songwriter duo from Los Angeles, were not the
        conventionally successful band they hoped they’d be. Feeling stuck and
        anxious about their future, the duo made a spontaneous decision to go
        “all in,” making a pact to play one show every day for a year. With
        suitcases and a guitar, the troubadours ventured out for a 365-day tour
        down unexplored roads, and onto unexpected stages, bringing their music
        to new audiences throughout 14 different countries. After So Many Days,
        is an intimate front row seat to the highs and lows of what it’s like
        for two people to pursue a dream, together.</image:caption
