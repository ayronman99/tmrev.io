        >What would happen if the world were suddenly without people - if humans
        vanished off the face of the earth? How would nature react - and how
        swiftly? On the edge of Europe, the deserted village of Chernobyl
        reveals the surprising answer after an unplanned experiment. Chernobyl
        was abandoned by people after the worst nuclear disaster in history
        (April 26, 1986). A level 7 meltdown resulted in a severe release of
        radioactivity following a massive explosion that destroyed the reactor.
        More than 20 years later, Chernobyl has been taken over by a remarkable
        collection of wildlife and descendents of pets that were left in the
        city when its residents fled the nuclear fallout. Unexpectedly in the
        aftermath of this disaster, Chernobyl has become a sanctuary for plants,
        birds, and animals, including some species thought to be on the brink of
        extinction.</image:caption
