        >Destiny has brought Ten and Pao to meet through a story in touring
        book. Though they haven't seen each other yet, the letters in the book
        was written and sent to both of them. Until one day, when they meet by
        chance, the acquaintance they've made through the book begins to blossom
        and develop to love. They vow not to be apart from one another no matter
        what would come. There's a twist when Ten doesn't get his birthday
        present that Pao sends to him, but they still hold on to the vow that
        one day they'll be together forever.</image:caption
