        >Nev, a 24-year-old New York-based photographer, has no idea what he's
        in for when Abby, an eight-year-old girl from rural Michigan, contacts
        him on Facebook, seeking permission to paint one of his photographs.
        When he receives her remarkable painting, Nev begins a friendship and
        correspondence with Abby's family. But things really get interesting
        when he develops a cyber-romance with Abby's attractive older sister,
        Megan, a musician and model. Prompted by some startling revelations
        about Megan, Nev and his buddies embark on a road trip in search of the
        truth.</image:caption
