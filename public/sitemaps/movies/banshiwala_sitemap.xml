        >Mridul a young man comes back to his ancestral home, from abroad after
        10 long years. The last 10 years had been very unfortunate for him as he
        could barely make two ends meet in London, as he never could procure a
        permanent job. His elder brother Protul who took him there looked after
        him for 8 years, but the last two years saw Mridul in a disastrous
        state. His only source of income was playing the flute in the house of
        the rich and famous. So, Mridul comes back to sell off his ancestral
        home and with the substantial amount he hopes to go back to London, pay
        off his debts and start a business.</image:caption
