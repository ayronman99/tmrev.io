        >Beyond the Myth is a film about dogs commonly referred to as "pit
        bulls" and those who love and defend these breeds. It explores the
        contributing factors behind the public's generalized fear of "pit
        bulls," and examines the conflict existing between advocates and
        opponents of breed discriminatory laws, as carried out in three cities
        that ban pit bull-type dogs: Denver, Miami, and Cincinnati-along with
        San Francisco, which requires the animals to be spayed and neutered.
