        >After inheriting a casino from his dead uncle, Matthew Dragna, his girl
        friend J.J. (Robin Sydney) and a group of friends take a road trip to
        the outskirts of Las Vegas, where they find the run-down Mysteria
        Casino. But the trip takes a frightening turn when the kids discover
        that the casino is haunted by the ghosts of Vegas mobsters Roy "The
        Word" Donahue (Sid Haig) and his goon Gil Wachetta (Michael Berryman),
        looking to settle an old score. Matthew and J.J. must fight for their
        very souls as the ghosts seek their gruesome vengeance, and in the vein
        of The Shining, this horrifying tale builds to a bloody and surprising
        climax.</image:caption
