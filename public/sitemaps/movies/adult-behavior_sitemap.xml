        >Frank leads a respectable yuppie life working at a noted Stockholm law
        firm. He has also been married for eight years to his beautiful wife
        Nenne, who runs an upscale boutique. Yet Frank is deeply bored with his
        life and is supremely randy. He even fantasizes about the marriage
        counselor that he and Nenne visit weekly. Eventually, Frank shacks up
        with a young fetching art student named Sofia, though the experience
        wracks Frank with guilt. Meanwhile, Nenne's friend and co-worker Rosie
        suspects that Frank is having an affair, though she does not have the
        nerve to tell her. Little does Rosie suspect, however, that her friend
        is sleeping with her lover Georg, an uptight journalist with an ego the
        size of Finland. Soon wires get crossed, and all hell breaks
        loose.</image:caption
