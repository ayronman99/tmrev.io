        >Set in the majestic rice terraces, Haw-Ang (English title: Before
        Harvest) is an indie film advocating children's right to quality
        education, empowerment of women, and welfare of our indigenous
        countrymen. It tells the story of Sister Adel, a light-hearted young nun
        who goes to a farming village in Ifugao to teach catechism and
        eventually build a schoolhouse. As she breaks the traditions of the
        tribe, she makes a big difference in the little lives of its people,
        especially that of Dacmay, a seven-year-old rowdy girl in search of her
        lost mother's love. At the same time, Sister Adel finally discovers her
        real mission in life. This is a poignant story of friendship and love
        that transcends age, culture, and belief. A tale that is at times comic
        and inevitably tragic, this is a film about being a woman, and more
        importantly, being human. It all begins at the time of preparing rice
        paddies for planting, in that season of hopes and dreams called
        "haw-ang.</image:caption
