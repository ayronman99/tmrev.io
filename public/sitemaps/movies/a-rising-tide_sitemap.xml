        >An inspirational story of redemption, A Rising Tide tells the tale of a
        young chef, Sam Rama. After the destruction of his family's
        well-established Atlantic City restaurant during Hurricane Sandy, Sam
        must grow up quickly, taking the biggest risks of his life, both in
        business and love. When Sam comes to the aid of a wealthy patron and
        then falls for the newly separated Sarah Bell, a chain of unexpected
        events unfolds for all of them, as they discover the only way to achieve
        their dreams may be to acknowledge what they owe to others, and realize
        that the greatest investments take more than cash.</image:caption
