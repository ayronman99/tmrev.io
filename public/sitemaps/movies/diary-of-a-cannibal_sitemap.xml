        >They met on the Internet. They fell in love. They drove to the desert
        and stopped at an abandoned warehouse. They wandered inside. Inside they
        found unspeakable horror. Only one of them survived the ordeal of
        CANNIBAL. From a hospital bed, an injured Noelle tells shocked police
        detectives a tale of cannibal terror. In recounting her ordeal, the
        detectives learn of an even more awful truth behind the actions of this
        tragic couple. Horror master Ulli Lommel's depraved tale of a modern-day
        CANNIBAL is based on the real-life case of a man who murdered and
        consumed his lover -- liver and all! -- in a strange act of consensual
        love. In Lommel's film of the events, two star-crossed lovers enter a
        world where madness rules and even a loved one can transform into a
        flesh-eating cannibal.</image:caption
