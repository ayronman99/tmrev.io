        >Three brutal murders are committed in a house in a quiet suburb. The
        victims are a former police officer, his wife and their 10 year old son.
        The Beck group takes on the case and find that there is a hidden
        security room in the victimsâ€™ house, containing stolen weapons. They
        find fingerprints from a criminal who was involved in a robbery 4 years
        ago. After the robbery, he shot his accomplices and disappeared without
        a trace, along with their haul of 6.3 million. The question is how the
        former police officer ended up with the weapons and how is he connected
        to the thieves? The case wakes strong feelings at Police Headquarters
        and takes highest priority.</image:caption
