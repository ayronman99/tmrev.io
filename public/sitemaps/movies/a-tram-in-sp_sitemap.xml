        >In a small town in the Basque country, Lucas and Maria are an elderly
        brother and sister. They share a house with their memories and the
        ghosts of the people they have loved throughout their lifes. They know
        that sooner or later they will buy their ticket for their final journey.
        Marcos and Roma are young and alone. She's a nurse and paints windows
        that embellish the views from her room. Marcos is a street performer
        with no home of his own, clinging to his accordion and a pile of
        questions. They don't know that sooner or later they will all set out on
        a journey together.</image:caption
