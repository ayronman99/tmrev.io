        >Medal of Honor Recipient George Sakato said with tear, ' I am not a
        hero. I just killed a lot of people. It's not good. This medal is for
        the people who couldn't return their homes, not for me.' Even many
        soldiers who received the decoration still have deep scars in their
        hearts now. He is the veteran of 442nd Regimental Combat Team in WW2
        composed of Japanese Americans, who were at first seen as the problem
        because of their race, but later seen as problem solvers because of
        their splendid achievements on the battle field. They had to fight not
        only the enemy but also prejudice. This is the story of the 442nd and
        their veterans now and then.</image:caption
