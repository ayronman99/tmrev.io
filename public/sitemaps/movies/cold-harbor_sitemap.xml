        >Four brothers, each lonely and alienated, reunite after their father
        commits suicide by drowning himself in the frigid ocean. Although the
        siblings don't get along, they begin to grow closer as they deal with
        their loss and discover new information about their father's life.
        Director Tom Brandau based this film on his real-life experiences after
        his own father's suicide.</image:caption
