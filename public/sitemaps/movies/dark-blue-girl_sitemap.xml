        >Luca is a strong-willed, soulful seven-year-old. After a two-year
        separation, her parents take her on a trip to pack up and sell their
        vacation home on a quiet island in the Aegean. Once there, her parentsâ€™
        romantic connection is reignited. This newfound intimacy unsettles the
        family dynamic, as Luca suddenly ceases to be the center of attention.
        With childish cleverness and determination, she plays her parents
        against each other, intent on keeping her place as the center of their
        worlds.</image:caption
