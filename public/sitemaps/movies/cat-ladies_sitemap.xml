        >Cat Ladies unravels the real story behind the oft-ridiculed 'cat lady'
        - a cultural stereotype and figure of ridicule for women of a certain
        age with too many furry companions. Through the intimate portrait of
        four unique 'cat ladies' we create a sensitive and emotionally honest
        portrait of women whose lives and self-worth have become intractably
        linked to cats. It's not the number of cats that defines someone as a
        'cat lady', but rather their attachment, or non-attachment, to human
        beings. They create a world with their cats in which they are accepted
        and in control - a world where they ultimately have
        value.</image:caption
