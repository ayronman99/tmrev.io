        >The remarkable life and career of the legendary Dick Vitale, ESPN's
        voice of college basketball for more than four decades, and an
        inspiration as he battles cancer, a disease he's been fighting on behalf
        of others for years as well. The film features more than 40 original
        interviews including Magic Johnson, Mike Krzyzewski, Charles Barkley,
        John Calipari, Robin Roberts, Chris Berman and Mike Tirico, among many
        leading voices from college basketball, sports broadcasting, and beyond,
        "Dickie V" is a fun, unforgettable, moving, inspirational ride through
        an incredible life still being lived, and a poignant tribute to a man
        still spreading love and joy wherever he goes.</image:caption
