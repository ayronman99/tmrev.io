        >Deng and his family live in a remote village deep in the Daba mountains
        of China’s Sichuan province. From 1968 to 1999, Luo visited this village
        to meet Deng and his friends, and was welcomed by the whole village. We
        see scenes of roadwork undertaken by the whole village, a traditional
        marriage ceremony and the innocent, smiling faces of the local children.
        This film evokes Luo’s paintings while often gently describing the
        villagers’ daily lives as they unfold against the backdrop of the four
        seasons.</image:caption
