        >Hsuan is a professional swimmer insecure about his “size” since he was
        young. He is unable to land a boyfriend because of this, and getting
        laid is completely out of the question. During a race, his swimsuit
        comes off, and his small secret is exposed to everyone there. After a
        month in isolation, Hsuan is encouraged by a friend to go back to the
        pool again. He then runs into his junior classmate, Fong, who he had a
        crush on. Will he overcome his shame and finally find
        love?</image:caption
