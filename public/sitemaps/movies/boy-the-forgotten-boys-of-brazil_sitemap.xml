        >The film accompanies the investigation of the historian Sidney Aguilar
        after the discovery of bricks marked with Nazi swastikas in the interior
        of SÃ£o Paulo. They then discover a horrifying fact that during the
        1930s, fifty black and mullato boys were taken from an orphanage in Rio
        de Janeiro to the farm where the bricks were found. There they were
        identified by numbers and were submitted to slave labour by a family
        that was part of the political and economic elite of the country and who
        did not hide their Nazi sympathizing ideals.</image:caption
