        >Lucy Worsley and David Starkey celebrate the 500th anniversary of
        Britain's finest surviving Tudor building, Hampton Court. As Henry
        VIII's pleasure palace, Hampton Court was a showcase for royal
        magnificence and ceremony - and the most important event of all was the
        christening of Henry's long-awaited son, Prince Edward, on October 15th,
        1537. Lucy and David explore how Tudor art, architecture and ritual came
        together for this momentous occasion. Drawing on historical records and
        with the help of a team of experts, they recreate key elements of the
        christening ceremony - including a magnificent set piece procession
        through Hampton Court involving nearly 100 people in full Tudor
        costume.</image:caption
