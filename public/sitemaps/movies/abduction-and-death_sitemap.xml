        >Argentina, the 70’s. One morning, several armed young men, dressed in
        military uniform, kidnap a Senior Army General and hide him in a modest
        cottage. There, without the hostage’s awareness of either the reason for
        his imprisonment or the people who planned it, the young kidnappers
        subject him to summary trial. In subsequent days, the military man will
        respond to an interrogation as severe as precise, that will lay bare the
        tense contradiction between two political and moral ideologies so
        incompatible that destruction surely awaits one of the opposite fields.
        The ending unveils a new chapter of a contemporary drama.</image:caption
