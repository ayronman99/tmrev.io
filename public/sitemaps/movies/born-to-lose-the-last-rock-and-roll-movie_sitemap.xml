        >Veteran documentary filmmaker and hipster Lech Kowalski creates this
        film about his friend and hard-partying rock god Johnny Thunders, member
        of legendary proto-punk band the New York Dolls. Through archive footage
        and interviews with such musicians as Dee Dee Ramone and Sylvain
        Sylvain, the film details his stint with the Dolls, the formation of his
        other band, the Heartbreakers; his rise to fame, particularly in Japan;
        his descent into heroin addiction, and the mysterious circumstances of
        his death.</image:caption
