        >Ten years have passed since Benedikt Stirner left his home in Bavaria
        after the fatal accident of his brother. Now he returns - the father is
        dying. But the strict family patriarch reacts dismissively, as does
        Benedict's brother, Anton. He is now betrothed to Benedict's great love
        Johanna and fears that his brother could take Johanna away from him. In
        fact, the two fall in love again. As a result, Benedict draws to Anton's
        open hatred. He does not suspect that Anton is the only one who knows
        the whole truth about the accidental death of his youngest
        brother.</image:caption
