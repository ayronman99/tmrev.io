        >Today, Camille turns nine. He had sworn that on his 9th birthday he
        would show his parents the videos he was shooting on the side - the tail
        of a cat scampering away, a window, and a veiled woman's face - an
        intriguing picture... Later that day, Camille's mother, Ariane, meets up
        with her son in the park. The boy appears perturbed. He is leaning
        against a tree, eyes cast down. He says that now he wants to return to
        his "real home" and his "real mother."</image:caption
