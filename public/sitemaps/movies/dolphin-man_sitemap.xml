        >As well as providing the subject for Luc Besson’s The Big Blue, Jacques
        Mayol did more than anyone to establish the sport of free diving to
        enormous depths without an oxygen supply. Using breathing techniques
        derived from yoga, he went to 50, 60, and even 100 meters—depths no one
        had considered to be within the bounds of human possibility. Mayol was a
        sportsman, a mystic, a vagabond, but above all, a man who believed in
        testing the limits of experience. This visually stunning tribute shows a
        man’s quest to be at one with the vastness of the ocean and to have no
        fear of the abyss within, where lurks serenity, freedom and finally,
        death.</image:caption
