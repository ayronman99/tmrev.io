        >Charlie's War is the story of Charlotte Lewis, a woman who is
        experiencing serious emotional and mental turmoil brought about by
        nightmares of increasing intensity. In the dreams, she is a young girl,
        and she runs from unknown terrors. Trying to understand her troubling
        dreams, Charlotte revisits part of her childhood, which comes back to
        her in a series of impressionistic memories. Charlie, her sister, Jobie,
        and her mother move in with her grandmother. It is 1944, and World War
        II rages in Europe and the Far East. Though Grandma's farm seems to be a
        peaceful refuge, there is an undercurrent of fear and brooding menace in
        their surroundings.</image:caption
