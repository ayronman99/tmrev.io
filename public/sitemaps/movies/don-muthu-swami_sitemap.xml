        >Don Muthu Swami is one of Bombay's most fearsome gangsters. On his
        deathbed, his father forces him to make a promise: that from now on he
        will lead a decent life. From that moment onwards, the don has a new
        purpose in life: to become Sir Muthu Swami instead. On of his new goals
        is to become fluent in Urdu, for which purpose he hires the young
        Jaikishan as a teacher. Don Muthu Swami has a beautiful daughter,
        Sanjana, whom he wants to get married to Pradhan, the son of his close
        friend. However, the don's right hand man, Preetam, asks for her hand as
        well. To impress Don Muthu Swami, he claims to be very rich by stealing
        millions from his employer. Sanjana herself, on the other hand, is
        desperate to get married to Jaikishan, and to scare off Pradhan, she
        fakes to be pregnant. The Don believe Preetam must be the culprit, but
        as it turns out, the girl Preetam loves is not Sanjana, but another girl
        who claims to be Don Muthu Swami's daughter, Ranjana.</image:caption
