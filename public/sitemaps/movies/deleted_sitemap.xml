        >The Singapore Special Tactics and Rescue (STAR) has received an order
        to wipe out all illegal activities of the organised criminal group.
        During the mission, Four-faced Buddha`s son Shawn was killed by an
        identified person, and a kidney that was intended to be illegally sold
        was stolen as well. Four-faced Buddha is a notorious human trafficker.
        STAR member Vincent hates Four-faced Buddha`s dehumanisation, and he
        joins the Singapore Special Investigation Division to destroy Four-faced
        Buddha. In the meantime, Four-faced Buddha has found Yusoff, who was
        once a STAR instructor, hiding in Malaysia. Yusoff was the one who
        killed Shawn and stole the kidney. He was willing to take the risk
        because his daughter was born with a kidney disease. Vincent and his
        team join forces to annihilate Four-faced Buddha`s
        organisation.</image:caption
