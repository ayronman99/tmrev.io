        >"Chile On Hell" was filmed at the Teatro Caupolican in Santiago, Chile
        on May 10, 2013, and features Anthrax - Joey Belladonna/vocals, Scott
        Ian/guitar, Charlie Benante/drums, Frank Bello/bass and Jon Donais/lead
        guitar. The band performed an extended set that featured songs from
        Anthrax's entire catalogue - all the fan-favorites including "I Am The
        Law," "Indians," "Madhouse," "Caught In A Mosh," "The Devil You Know,"
        and "I'm Alive." "Santiago was the perfect place to film the show for
        this," said Anthrax's Charlie Benante. "When we'd played there in the
        past, we'd finish our set, play our encore and go back to the dressing
        room. But every time, the fans would continue to scream and cheer and
        clap. I mean, they went on and on, they wouldn't stop. One time Scott
        and I walked out to the side of the stage just to watch what was going
        on in the audience, it was intense. Why wouldn't we want to film a DVD
        in front of an audience like that?</image:caption
