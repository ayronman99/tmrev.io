        >After her daughter's fatal accident at a busy intersection, Jenni is
        confronted with videos on the web of Mia dying. Instead of helping,
        passersby were filming with their cell phones. The horrific images won't
        let Jenni go. Horror and rage at the gawkers' pitiless curiosity take
        her completely captive. There is hardly any room for her grief; instead,
        she obsessively searches for the accident spectators in order to
        confront them with the consequences of their sensationalism. She finds
        what she's looking for â€“ but her first encounters don't help her. No one
        seems aware of any wrongdoing, or capable of admitting it. Supported by
        a tough lawyer, Jenni decides to take action against the
        sensationalists.</image:caption
