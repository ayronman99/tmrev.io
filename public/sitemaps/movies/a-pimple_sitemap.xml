        >A person has a problem about creation and she is so stressful because
        of it. Moreover, a red pimple comes out on the nose. Time goes by, she
        is getting painful by the pressure of creation and a pimple. Suddenly,
        she decides to remove a pimple because she thinks a pimple is an origin
        of all her problems. From the removal pimple, she finds a green leaf
        which has a small yellow egg and then, the larva becomes a beautiful
        moss. The moss starts to fly.</image:caption
