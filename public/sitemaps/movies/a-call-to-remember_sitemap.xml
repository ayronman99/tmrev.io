        >Paula Tobias, a Holocaust survivor who has suffered the ultimate
        personal tragedy of losing her spouse and children during the Nazi
        occupation of World War II. Now re-married and living in America during
        the late 1960's with husband David, they build a new life together with
        sons Ben and Jake. One evening, Paula receives a phone call which
        assures her that her son, Alec, is actually alive and in New York. This
        brings up painful memories from the past for everyone involved,
        including Ben and Jake, who force their father to talk about the
        Holocaust. Paula rushes to New York only to find that it was a mistake -
        Alec was never found. She falls into a dramatic depression, as the
        family confronts their fears and tries to stay together.</image:caption
