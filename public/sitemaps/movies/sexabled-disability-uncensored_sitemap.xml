        >This 14 minute short documentary features a panel hosted by the
        Disabled Student Union at University of California Berkeley called "Are
        Cripples Screwed." In addition to the panel, viewers are introduced to a
        community of disabled individuals who address misconceptions and
        stereotypes about sex and disability while sharing stories about their
        intimate relationships. Enjoy engaging with Bay area community members
        and comedian Josh Blue (winner of Last Comic Standing) as they share
        their personal experiences with sex, dating and intimacy.</image:caption
