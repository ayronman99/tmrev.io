        >Coming &amp; Going is an irreverent romantic comedy that poses the
        question: How far would you go to capture the heart of the one you love?
        Lee (Rhys Darby) is a young, skilled OBGYN who lacks confidence when it
        comes to talking to women outside his successful medical practice. A
        minor injury temporarily lands him in a wheelchair and it is at that
        precise time that he meets his dream girl Alex (Sasha Alexander).
        Convinced she's only paid attention to him because he's in that chair,
        he stays in it to win her affections well after his injury has healed.
        Coming &amp; Going is about love and the extreme things people do for
        it.</image:caption
