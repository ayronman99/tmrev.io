        >Leave it to Björk to make a concert release that can be treated as part
        of her regular body of work rather than a side note. While Björk fans
        have occasionally complained about the amount of repackaging of her
        albums, Voltaic reaffirms just how important the live aspect is to her
        music, and provides a couple of different perspectives on it as well.
        Volta sparked a particularly inspired and lavish tour that, arguably,
        ended up being bigger than the actual album was, but tapped into the
        most dramatic, primal, and elegant aspects of Björk's art overall. It's
        fitting, then, that the chronicles of the Volta tour are just as
        thoughtfully crafted as the shows were.</image:caption
