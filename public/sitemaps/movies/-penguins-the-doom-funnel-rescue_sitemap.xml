        >Jason Conrad is bored staying at his grandmother's house with his
        sister for the summer. It gets worse when his best friend write to tell
        him all about Space Camp, but he has nothing interesting to write about.
        When he finally finds something of interest - a pet mouse - the
        space-faring penguins come to life and draft him into helping them
        deliver an emergency supply of duct tape to Space Colony Doublewide
        before the doom funnel season gets started. But will the arrive in
        time?</image:caption
