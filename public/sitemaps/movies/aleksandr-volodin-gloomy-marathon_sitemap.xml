        >An almost unknown girl Frida accompanied Aleksandr Volodin to the
        front. When he returned, he married her. A sense of duty and gratitude
        bound them, but this did not prevent him from continuing to search for a
        female ideal... The name of the poet and playwright Aleksandr Volodin is
        familiar to everyone who loves russian cinema and theater. The films
        Elder Sister, Five Evenings, The Magician, Autumn Marathon, the famous
        performances of the Tovstonogov's BDT and Efremov's Sovremennik, staged
        according to his plays, were remembered for their unique intonation, the
        soft, not at all edifying voice of a person who knows something about
        life that we pass by without noticing. Most of Volodin's works are
        autobiographical, he writes about his generation, about the generation
        "scorched by war".</image:caption
