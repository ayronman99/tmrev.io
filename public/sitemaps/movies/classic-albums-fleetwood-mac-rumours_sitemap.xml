        >Formed in 1975 from the remnants of a British blues band and a
        California soft-rock duo, Fleetwood Mac evolved into one of the most
        successful pop-rock groups of the 1970s--a reputation no doubt cemented
        by their 1977 masterpiece RUMOURS. One of the bestselling albums of all
        time, RUMOURS' impeccable songwriting, lush vocal harmonies, and
        polished production stand as testament to the band's cohesive powers--a
        fact made even more remarkable by the romantic tensions roiling amongst
        its members at the time (Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks were ending
        their long-term romantic relationship; Christine and John McVie were
        getting a divorce). This episode of the CLASSIC ALBUMS series recounts
        the making of Fleetwood Mac's career-making opus through interviews,
        behind-the-scenes footage, and live performances of timeless gems such
        as "Don't Stop," "Dreams,""Go Your Own Way," "You Make Loving Fun," "The
        Chain," and more.</image:caption
