        >Sunday night's Pyramid Stage has never quite seen a headliner like
        Beyoncé. The former Destiny's Child singer watched from side of stage as
        husband Jay-Z blew Noel Gallagher and half of Pilton away with an
        extraordinary set three years ago, and returned in 2011 to take on
        Glasto for herself. The Texan's stunning entrance confirmed that Knowles
        knows how to put on a show, and one of the biggest crowds the Pyramid
        stage has ever seen were delighted to be greeted by Sasha at her
        fiercest. This set, peppered with Prince and Kings Of Leon covers
        alongside the biggest hits of Beyoncé's career will be remembered long
        after the grass has re-sprouted on the fields of Worthy
        farm.</image:caption
