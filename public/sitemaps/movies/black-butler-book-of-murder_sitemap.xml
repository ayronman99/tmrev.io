        >At the Queen’s request, Ciel and the demon butler Sebastian host an
        extravagant dinner party for the who’s who of the London underground.
        But an evening that begins with the promise of unmatched elegance
        quickly spirals into mayhem when their most distinguished guest is found
        murdered in his room. Now, trapped in the Phantomhive Manor by a dark
        and stormy night, Ciel and Sebastian must work together with their
        high-class guests, including the legendary author Sir Arthur Conan
        Doyle, to find the murderer in their midst before the blame falls on the
        host and his somewhat suspicious staff.</image:caption
