        >Class 3-E is getting ready for their class trip to Kyoto, and
        Koro-sensei is as excited as ever! Nagisa is in a group with Kaede,
        Karma, Tomohito, Manami, and the class idol Yukiko Kanzaki. The students
        are aware of the fact that this is a great opportunity to assassinate
        Koro-sensei, but they cannot help having great time with him. However,
        the trip becomes even more exciting and dangerous when they get attacked
        by a bunch of delinquents who kidnap the girls. As if that is not
        enough, there is a hired sniper named Red Eye lurking around, ready to
        be the one who would assassinate Koro-sensei and claim the prize. Can
        the students of Class 3-E rely on Koro-sensei even now?</image:caption
