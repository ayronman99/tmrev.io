        >April 13th, 1970, 180,000 miles from Earth, a devastating malfunction
        leaves Apollo 13 leaking previous oxygen and its crew of three
        astronauts facing a life and death crisis. If Mission Control cannot
        find a way to bring Apollo 13 home, the astronauts will be stranded
        200,000 miles from Earth in their dying ship. Now with limited power and
        supplies on board the spacecraft, the ground teams work around the
        clocking, engineering creative solutions to overcome carbon dioxide
        poisoning, dehydration and the freezing temperatures of deep space, to
        ensure the crew's survival. Using spectacular NASA footage, exclusive
        interviews with Apollo space scientists and stunning visual effects;
        this film explores the thirteen remarkable factors that brought the crew
        safely home, and the full story of the courage and ingenuity that
        cemented Apollo 13 as NASA's finest hour.</image:caption
