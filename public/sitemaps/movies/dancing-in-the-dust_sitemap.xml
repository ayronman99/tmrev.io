        >When forced to divorce his wife by family and social pressure because
        her mother is a prostitute, Nazar (Khodaparast) works double shifts to
        pay back the loan he took out for his impulsive wedding and to pay some
        ongoing restitution to his sweet jilted bride, Reyhaneh (Kosari). When
        he falls behind in the payments he flees the police and ends up in the
        desert with an uncommunicative old man (Gharibian) who catches poisonous
        snakes for their venom. These two are forced to coexist in the desert,
        because Nazar is unwilling to return to the city and wants to catch
        snakes to make enough money to settle his debts. His verbose, chattering
        annoys the reticent old man until Nazar's life is endangered. Written by
