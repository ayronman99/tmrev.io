        >Based on a true story, "Dynamite: A Cautionary Tale" follows family man
        Max Bornstein who was a full-time dope fiend working within the
        underground, highly illegal pornography industry in 1968â€™s New York
        City. While running books and films to delivery points and mob
        headquarters around the east coast, Max had the Feds on his tail. But
        even in the wake of a federal investigation, Max's truest worry was his
        wife and two young children, a family kept in the dark about Max's
        reality and the walls of it caving in around him. As Max battles his
        consuming addiction, dissolving family unit and the growing suspicion
        about his drug use amongst his associates, Max watches helplessly as his
        well-crafted reality falls to pieces, leaving him searching for the
        spaces in between.</image:caption
