        >This is another one of the cartoons I wrote and directed for The Sarah
        Silverman Program. Same team as the other Sarah cartoons, consisting of
        Andrew Delange on backgrounds, design, and color; Myke Chilian on
        character animation, design, and color, AND the absolutely adorable
        Sevan Najarian on Aftereffects animating, lip sync, and other odds and
        ends. We were a one stop shop. We had it down. We knew what we were
        doing. We had it all figured out. Huge shout out to Abed Gheith who
        voiced the evil Mister Cookiecrumble guy. He really did a great job.

        to run around the sets and be assholes while everyone else worked hard
        to produce and film Sarahâ€™s show. I would go and grab whoever I could in
        between takes and record them in an office or whatever I had available
        to me. We really were a rag tag team of rough and tumble animators, just
        finding our way in the big bright city. I was so proud/
        excite...</image:caption
