        >Over four nights at Tilburg's 013 venue (scene of the Ayreon Universe
        series of live shows in 2017) Lucassen, his band and one of modern
        progressive music's most emphatic of casts celebrated the 20th
        anniversary of the third Ayreon album in front of thousands of adoring
        fans who had flown in from around the world. The entire album was
        performed live, featuring original album singers and musicians, such as
        Thijs Van Leer, Fish, Damian Wilson, Edward Reekers, Anneke van
        Giersbergen, and several special guests including Simone Simons (Epica)
        and Star Trek's John De Lancie as narrator. The 'Other Tales' are deep
        cuts from Arjen Lucassen's other projects, such as The Gentle Storm,
        Ambeon, Stream of Passion, Guilt Machine, Star One, his solo-album Arjen
        Anthony Lucassen and a very special Marillion cover.</image:caption
