        >Cane Toads: The Conquest is a comic yet provocative account of
        Australia’s most notorious environmental blunder from filmmaker Mark
        Lewis.Shot against the harsh and beautiful landscape of northern
        Australia, Cane Toads: The Conquest tracks the unstoppable journey of
        the toad across the continent. Director Mark Lewis (Cane Toads: An
        Unnatural History, The Natural History of the Chicken) injects his
        trademark irreverence and humor into the story as he follows a trail of
        human conflict, bizarre culture and extraordinary close
        encounters.Filmed with high-resolution 3D technology, Cane Toads is the
        first Australian digital 3D feature film.  Custom designed equipment
        allows viewers to get up close and personal with these curious creatures
        like never before. The unique viewing experience is like being immersed
        in the world of the toad.</image:caption
