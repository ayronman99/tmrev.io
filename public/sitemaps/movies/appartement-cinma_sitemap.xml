        >There is a certain hotel which caters to people who have lost their
        way. People trying to get their lives back on track, or simply trying to
        find out where they went wrong. One of the people staying at this hotel
        is Wolf, who playfully follows the self-absorbed young Anna around the
        hotel. No one knows what he did before he came there, though he used to
        joke that he was an assassin. Anna is a one-hit movie actress who now
        spends all of her time cultivating "patrons" to support
        her.</image:caption
