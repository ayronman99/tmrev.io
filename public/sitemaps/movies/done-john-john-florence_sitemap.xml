        >When a person’s understanding of waves is so concrete, surfing can
        become especially reminiscent of modern skateboarding. Mutating masses
        of water almost appear as still and solid as skatepark transitions as
        John John Florence spins through the air over them; landing back into
        each evolving pocket. John John demonstrates this new level of surfing
        in his first independent release, DONE. Directed by Blake Vincent Kueny
        and John John Florence, DONE takes the DIY ethos and flips it on it’s
        head. Shot in beautiful HD, 16mm, and Super-8 in top-notch locations
        that include Tahiti, Western Australia, South Africa, and Hawaii, this
        highly anticipated film invites the viewer to travel with John John as
        he searches and finds some of the most incredible waves on
        Earth.</image:caption
