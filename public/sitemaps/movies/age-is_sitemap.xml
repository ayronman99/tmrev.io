        >Stephen Dwoskinâ€™s final film is a meditation on the subjective
        experience and cultural concepts of ageing. The film is an ode to the
        texture, the beauty, the singularity of aging faces and silhouettes, a
        hypnotic poem in the Dwoskin meaning of the term which is long
        observations of very tiny details. A gesture, a pause, a look, a moment.
        Throughout his films intimacy has always played a leading role and this
        is also true for Age is..., all the faces being close friends, or close
        friends relatives and sometimes even Stephen himself.</image:caption
