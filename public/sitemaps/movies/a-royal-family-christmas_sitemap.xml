        >In the sequel to "A Royal Family Holiday", the children Phillip "Flip"
        Royal (Romeo Miller), a good-looking spiritual guru; Austin Royal (Eric
        Myrick III, At Sunrise), a Washington, D.C. community activist; Kelsey
        Royal (Chelsea Tavares, Fright Night), a fashion designer's gopher; and
        Pamela Royal (Taquilla Whitfield, Magic Mike XXL), a hair and nail salon
        owner; join forces to reunite their parents in time for Christmas. They
        try every trick in the book - including "playing nice" and setting aside
        old sibling rivalries - only to learn their mom and dad are enjoying
        "the single life." Their plan also goes awry as getting their parents
        back together ends up taking a back seat to their own personal and
        professional drama.</image:caption
