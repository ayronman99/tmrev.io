        >Los Angeles in the year 2005: 19-year-old lads move through an
        apartment that has been equipped with webcams and looks like some sort
        of futuristic internet doll's house. Not-quite-so-young men fulfil their
        sexual dreams as protagonists in bareback productions. And, at private
        sex parties, almost every second guy has either taken part in a porn
        film or wants to. In 1997, I followed on camera the fortunes of a group
        of men who had chosen to wok - either artistically or commercially -
        with their bodies. This footage later become part of my 1998
        documentary, SEX/LIFE IN L.A.. I'm still in touch with some of the men
        in that film, these include: lone battler Kevin Kramer, mature shooting
        star Cole Tucker, American boy-next-door Matt Bradshaw and friends of
        the occasional model John Garwood, who died of an overdose in 1998. Some
        of these men have successful careers behind them, others have left the
        sex industry altogether.</image:caption
