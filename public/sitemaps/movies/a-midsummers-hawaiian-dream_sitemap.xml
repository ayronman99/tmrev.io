        >Attorney Tanya McQueen has hired a team of anthropologists to find an
        ancient artifact which, if found, would halt development of Nick
        Button's shopping mall in the sacred Hemolele Forest on Kaua'i. The team
        is led by the experienced duo of Helen and Demetri, joined by grad
        students Zander and Hermione. The team is seen by Omaka, a native
        Hawaiian kahuna, and his mischievous aide, Puka. Sensing Helen's
        yearning for passion from Demetri, Puka doses the man with the nectar of
        a special flower from the forest -- but he has dosed Zander instead,
        triggering confusion and hilarity. When Puka tries to make amends by
        dosing Demetri too, and later Tanya as well, the results are surprising
        and wonderfully zany. Love wins the day.</image:caption
