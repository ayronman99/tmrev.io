        >Dancing to Architecture was the first open source documentary of its
        kind and is to date the only existing motion picture account of the
        phenomenal This Is Not Art festivals (TINA) - held in Newcastle,
        Australia every year in October. Filmed in 2002, Dancing to Architecture
        is essential for anyone who wants to gain an impression of what the TINA
        festival is like. It is rapid, chaotic, anarchic and urgent. It is
        dramatic, electric, technical, and socially relevant. It is Australiaâ€™s
        biggest event for communications, new media arts, music and activism. If
        you are expecting this film to tell you what This Is Not Art is, then we
        suggest you stop and go look at their website instead:</image:caption
