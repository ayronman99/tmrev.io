        >A boy posts a message on the Internet seeking a suicide partner. A girl
        reads it and flies to meet him one week later. Together they jump off a
        600-meter cliff. They found each other on an Internet newsgroup called
        alt.suicide.holiday, or ASH. Internet newsgroups are virtual discussion
        forums amongst people with common interests. The subject of this one is
        suicide. You come across thousands of letters. The unknown leave behind
        their open hearted life stories for us to read. Who are these people and
        why are they seeking each other on the Internet? What lives lay hidden
        behind the blue light of the computers. In ASH worlwide suicide we meet
        four writers of this newsgroup.</image:caption
