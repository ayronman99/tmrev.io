        >In Hong Kong's Paradise Cove Sharon (Chrissie Chau) and Rachel (Theresa
        Fu) work at a restaurant of their kung fu master uncle Tao (Lo Mang)
        while taking on rivals in beach volleyball matches. The wealthy Bu
        family has plans to have the beach made into a playground for the rich
        and getting rid of the youth at the beach. Mrs. Bu's two Eurasian
        daughters, Natalie (Jessica C) and Phoenix (Phoenix Valen) challenge
        Sharon and Rachel to a volleyball match which Natalie and Phoenix win.
        Phoenix and Natalie give Rachel and Sharon a challenge: if the two local
        girls enter and win the upcoming All Hong Kong Womenâ€™s Volleyball
        tournament, Mrs. Bu will revise her plans to further develop the area.
        Sharon and Rachel feel they don't have a chance to win the tournament.
        Their uncle then Tao teaches the girls kung fu skills that they apply to
        volleyball.</image:caption
