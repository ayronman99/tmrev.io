        >1982 was a momentous year for Iron Maiden. Following the addition of
        brilliant new vocalist Bruce Dickinson, their third album the number of
        the beast was released to universal acclaim from both critics and rock
        fans. The album topped the UK charts for 2 weeks, launched them into the
        US top 40 for the first time, and invaded the top 10 album charts
        worldwide achieving a plethora of gold and platinum awards. The number
        of the beast is regarded as one of the greatest and most influential
        heavy metal albums of all time, including, along with demonic title
        track, such classic metal anthems as run to the hills, hallowed be thy
        name, the prisoner and children of the damned. This exclusive film tells
        the full and vibrant story behind the making of the
        album.</image:caption
