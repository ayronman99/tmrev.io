        >When Michael McCann is thrown over by the woman he loves, he becomes
        something of a misanthrope and a miser, spending all of his spare money
        on collectible gold coins. Living in the same town is an affluent family
        with two sons: John and Tanny. Tanny's a wild boy, whom John cannot
        control, and one night he breaks into McCann's house, and steals the
        gold and disappears, which nearly confirms McCann's distrust of mankind.
        But then, a mysterious young woman dies in the snow outside McCann's
        house, and her small daughter makes her way to McCann's house and into
        McCann's life and heart.</image:caption
