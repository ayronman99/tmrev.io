        >When Shakespeare Must Die, a Thai film adaptation of Macbeth is banned
        by the Thai government as a threat to national security, the film's
        producer treks through the corridors of power to un-ban his
        Shakespearean horror movie--from the Cultural ministry to the Senate and
        the National Human Rights Commission, all the way to the Administrative
        Court where he is suing the government for abuse of power. Wherever he
        went, amidst political upheaval, his director followed with a camera.
        The resulting reality cinema is the living story of a struggle for
        justice and human dignity, for freedom of expression, which Thai
        filmmakers do not have. A dark cinematic record of democracy in action,
        in all its farcical, obscene and heartbreaking details.</image:caption
