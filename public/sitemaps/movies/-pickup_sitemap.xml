        >Harry Mitchell is a successful Los Angeles manufacturer whose wife is
        running for city council. His life is turned upside down when three
        blackmailers confront him with a videotape of him with his young
        mistress and demand $100,000. Fearing that the story will hurt his
        wife's political campaign if he goes to the police, Harry pretends that
        he will pay the men, but does not follow through.</image:caption
