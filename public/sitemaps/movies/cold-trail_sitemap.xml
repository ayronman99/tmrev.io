        >Cold Trail is a thriller that revolves around a ruthless tabloid
        reporter, Baldur, who goes to any lengths to dig up a sensational story.
        In the beginning of the story, a Security Guard is killed by an apparent
        accident in a remote and apparently haunted dam in the highlands of
        Iceland. At first, Baldur has no interest in the story; that is, until
        he discovers from his mother that the Security Guard was his biological
        father â€“ a Man he never knew. Baldur becomes determined to find out more
        about his father and what happened to him, and leaves to investigate
        against the will of his editor.</image:caption
