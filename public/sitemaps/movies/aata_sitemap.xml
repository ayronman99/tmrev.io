        >Sri Krishna (Siddharth) grows up watching films playing in the theater
        in which his father works as a movie-projectionist in a village. Satya
        (Ileana) is harassed by Vicky (Munna) - son of a politician - who wants
        to marry her. Satya escapes from home and Sri Krishna falls in love with
        her the first time he meets her. As the goons and police chase Satya,
        Sri Krishna protects her and drops her in the house of the politician.
        He wins Vickyâ€™s confidence. Then, he plays a one sided game with him. At
        the end, the police that were working with Vicky turn against him and
        arrest Vicky and his parents. Satya and Sri Krishna get
        married.</image:caption
