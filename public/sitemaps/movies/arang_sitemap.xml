        >A salt storehouse near the sea may be haunted. A penniless ex-con dies
        a gristly death in a house he can ill afford. The detectives assigned
        the case are Min, newly reinstated after a suspension, and Lee, a new
        transfer from forensics. Min has nightmares: a sexual assault that
        haunts her. She and Lee work well together, but soon two more deaths
        occur - each mysteriously poisoned, both friends of the ex-con. A fourth
        friend, a newly married doctor, is a suspect. But what has all this to
        do with the salt storehouse, a death ten years ago, and a missing girl?
        Can Min and Lee get to the bottom of it, or is the supernatural beyond a
        cop's reach?</image:caption
