        >Def Comedy Jam played host to some of the greatest comedians of the
        1990s, many of whom went on to greater fame, due in part to the exposure
        they received on the program. Here, Mark Curry and Steve Harvey both
        show off some comic chops that that could never air on their respective
        network TV shows, though Harvey has shown this side of himself in Spike
        Lee's excellent THE ORIGINAL KINGS OF COMEDY. Rounding out the
        performers are Don "D.C." Curry (NEXT FRIDAY) and Arnez J. Contains two
        episodes.</image:caption
