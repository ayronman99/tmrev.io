        >While Nobita is sleeping, he suddenly feels the floor is trembling,
        like there would be an earthquake in his room. A little rabbit from an
        alternate universe named Chamii opens the door between the dimensions
        using a hammer and gets inside Nobita's room through the floor. Nobita
        wakes up and Doraemon hears somebody steal food from the fridge in the
        kitchen. It is Chamii, who gets caught by Doraemon and Nobita. She shows
        them the passageway through Nobita's floor into the spaceship. After
        they enter the spaceship, they see Koya Koya Planet. They meet a boy
        named Roppuru.</image:caption
