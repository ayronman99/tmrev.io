        >Before the advent of television, animated shorts were screened in movie
        theaters as part of the pre-feature presentation. When those classic
        cartoons were finally aired on television in the 1950s and '60s, many
        were shortened to fit into required broadcast time limits. Boasting
        crisply remastered sound and picture quality, this collection restores
        nine classic Christmas-themed cartoons to their original theatrical
        lengths for an authentic moviegoing experience from the Golden Age of
        Cinema: "Ginger Nutt's Christmas Circus," "Peeping Penguins," "A Waif's
        Welcome," "Christmas Comes But Once a Year," "Jack Frost," "Hawaiian
        Birds," "Hector's Hectic Life," "Snow Foolin'," and Max Fleischer's
        "Somewhere in Dreamland," which appears in its original Technicolored
        full-length for the first time in 50 years.</image:caption
