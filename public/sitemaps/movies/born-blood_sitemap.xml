        >It was an innocent time, a time for pastel dresses, jukebox music and
        Elvis worship. Life in Bangkok then was a very different from now, when
        the boys did their hair like James Dean and the girls wore outfits with
        an eye towards prudence. At one of the local dances, attended to by all
        the young people in town, a boy meets a girl. As they dance together for
        the first time, a love is born. And first loves, in a way, always last
        forever. But is everything as it seems in this idyllic place and time?
        For, as she is soon about to discover, looks can be deceiving, and the
        young man she has just become devoted to may be a lot more vicious, and
        dangerous, then she ever could have imagined. Is an era of peace and
        innocence about to end?</image:caption
