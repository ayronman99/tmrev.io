        >A House on Fire follows brilliant doctor and mother Deborah Green
        (Stephanie March) who had the epitome of a picture-perfect life with two
        children, an adoring husband (Shaun Benson) and a beautiful house in an
        opulent neighborhood. But behind the curtain is a rocky marriage that
        includes Deb’s difficult bedside manner, her inability to get along with
        other doctors and an abuse of pills and alcohol, major envy of her
        husband’s successful medical career and his easy social manner, that
        takes a terrible turn and leaves her family and marriage in
        ruin.</image:caption
