        >It's summertime, and Greg Heffley is looking forward to playing video
        games and spending time with his friends. However, Greg's dad has other
        plans: He's decided that some father-son bonding time is in order.
        Desperate to prevent his dad from ruining summer vacation, Greg pretends
        he has a job at a ritzy country club. But Greg's plan backfires, leaving
        him in the middle of embarrassing mishaps and a camping trip gone
        wrong.</image:caption
