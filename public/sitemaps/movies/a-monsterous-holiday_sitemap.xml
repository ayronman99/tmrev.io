        >Geeky school kid Andy dreams of being a great inventor, but he’s having
        trouble coming up with a “big idea” that will win the Science Fair and
        beat scheming twins April and May. Even worse his Dad is pressuring him
        into joining the football team, that he just happens to coach and his
        big brother just happens to be the star of. Andy decides to ask the
        town’s resident scientist, Dr. Frankenstein, for advice, but on a visit
        to his creepy mansion instead he meets a green football-loving teenage
        monster named Frank, who wishes he could join in the way Andy can.
        Excitedly Andy realizes that he and Frank may just be able to solve each
        other’s troubles by switching places, and his plan goes smoothly until
        suddenly they’ve got a monster problem on their hands that threatens the
        entire town.</image:caption
