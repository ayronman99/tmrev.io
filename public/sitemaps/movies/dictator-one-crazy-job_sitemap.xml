        >Theyâ€™ve become the human face of inhuman barbarity. Leaders like
        Hitler, Idi Amin Dada, Stalin, Kim Jong Il, Saddam Hussein, Nicolae
        Ceausescu, Bokassa, Muammar Kadhafi, Khomeini, Mussolini and Franco
        governed their countries completely cut off from reality. These paranoid
        leaders were driven to abuse their power by the pathology of power
        itself. Dictators are driven by a relentless, thought-out determination
        to impose themselves as infallible, all-knowing and all-powerful beings.
        But they are also men ruled by their caprices, uncontrollable impulses,
        and reckless fits of frenzy, which paradoxically render them as human as
        anyone else. The abuses they committed were clearly atrocious, yet some
        of them were as outlandish as the characters portrayed in the film The
        Dictator. They sunk to depths worthy of Kafka: so incredibly absurd,
        they are outrageously funny.</image:caption
