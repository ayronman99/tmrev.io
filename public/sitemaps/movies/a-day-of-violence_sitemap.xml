        >Mitchell Parker lies dead on a morgue slab. In life, 'Mitchell' served
        the low ranks of Debt Collectors, surrounded by all the filth and scum
        that the world had to offer. He thought his luck was in, when on a
        routine collection he stumbles across 100,000 in cash, hidden in the
        sofa of one of his clients. A dark and haunting past hangs over the head
        of 'Mitchell Parker', one that will lead him on a journey of redemption
        and ultimately sacrifice. Hunted by the gang whose Money he has stolen.
        He must evade capture and use the money to rid himself of his demons
        once and for all. Witness his last days of life.</image:caption
