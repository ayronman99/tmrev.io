        >Richard Hobert, the director behind the Seven Deadly Sins series, was
        long silent about the sins described in these films. One summer evening
        in Österlen in 2000, he revealed the answers. Richard Hobert himself and
        the protagonist Göran Stangertz also reveal new breathtaking depths in
