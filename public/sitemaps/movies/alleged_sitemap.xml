        >Alleged is a romantic drama based on events occurring behind the scenes
        and outside the courtroom of the famous Scopes "Monkey Trial" of 1925.
        Charles Anderson, a talented young reporter, feels trapped working for
        his deceased father's weekly newspaper and living in a tiny town
        (Dayton, TN) in steep decline. Seeing the "Monkey Trial" as a
        once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to break into the journalistic big
        leagues, Charles manages to insert himself into the middle of the "Trial
        of the Century." Once in the midst of this staged event, however, he is
        torn between his love for the more principled Rose, his fiancée, and the
        escalating moral compromises that he is asked to make as the eager
        protégé of H.L. Mencken, America's most colorful and influential
        columnist.</image:caption
