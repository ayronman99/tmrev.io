        >Officer Rod Davis becomes embedded undercover when a cartel starts
        bringing drugs into the city through fish shipments. He soon finds
        himself and his city under siege when a scientist accidentally creates
        mutant fish people with a poisonous bite. It's up to the rookie cop and
        a sexy lab assistant to find the drug stash and destroy the crime lord
        controlling the mutant monsters, but it turns personal when Rod's sister
        is kidnapped. Are they fighting giant mutant fish monsters just for the
        halibut? See the badge, bass, and ass in a horror-comedy that you won't
        want to throw back... because it's the "Catch of the
        Day."</image:caption
