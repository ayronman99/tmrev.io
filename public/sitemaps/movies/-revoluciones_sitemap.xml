        >Marcel Keoroglian, a public figure in Uruguay thanks to his works in
        carnival, television, radio and cinema, has at home eighteen records of
        the 1949 carnival that have never been heard. These records were
        recorded by Jos√© Goglian, an Armenian immigrant, who in the 1940s lived
        in Villa del Cerro (a Montevidean neighborhood made up of many immigrant
        groups) and who invited his neighbour carnival musicians to his
        apartment to record them with a phonograph. This documentary is focused
        on Marcel's passionate bond with the murga genre, as he writes the
        lyrics for a group that is preparing for the next carnival, while
        looking for a way to revive the music of these albums that awaited
        sixty-eight years to be heard.</image:caption
