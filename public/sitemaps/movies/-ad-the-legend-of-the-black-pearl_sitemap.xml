        >Far into the future after the world has brought about the apocalypse
        what remains of humanity has split into two warring tribes - the
        Plaebian and the Huron. Human kind's ambitions are not wealth or
        prosperity, but merely survival. The Huron tribe have reverted to the
        Hunter/Gatherer methods of our forefathers becoming great warriors with
        no regard to the future. Whereas the Plaebians are trying to rebuild
        society and tame the wilderness that surrounds mankind when a new,
        unforeseen evil starts to kill them both. This unspeakable evil - the
        Sinasu. Now both tribes must work together or finally face humanity's
        extinction. Written by Randolph Kret</image:caption
