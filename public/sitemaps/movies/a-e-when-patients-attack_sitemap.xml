        >Hospital staff are reporting more violence and anti-social behaviour
        than ever before. In 2015, 8 staff were assaulted every hour – a new
        record high. At The Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham – one of the
        UK’s biggest hospitals – they think they have the answer. Here a private
        security force of 46 uniformed guards, and a sophisticated CCTV system,
        keep staff and patients safe. A colourful mixture of characters ranging
        from ex-soldiers, to bouncers, to former elite sportsmen, it’s the
        security team’s job to keep the hospital running smoothly. With more
        than 2 million visitors they have to deal with all aspects of crime and
        anti-social behaviour. All against a back drop of life changing and life
        saving procedures.</image:caption
