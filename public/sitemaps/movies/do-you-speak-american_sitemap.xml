        >Do You Speak American? is a documentary film and accompanying book
        about journalist Robert MacNeil's investigation into how different
        people throughout the United States of America speak. The book and
        documentary look at the evolution of America's way of speaking from the
        English language to various ways of speaking in regions throughout the
        country. Divisions of ethnicity, geography and social status and how
        they affect how Americans communicate are addressed. As part of the
        project, MacNeil traveled across the country conducting interviews with
        ordinary people as well as experts such as William Labov.</image:caption
