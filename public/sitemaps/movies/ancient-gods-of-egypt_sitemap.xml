        >"Gods of Egypt" was a huge box office success but the true Gods were
        more ancient and mysterious than fiction. Powerful and deadly, all
        knowing, and all seeing, they were the original Masters of the Universe.
        They originated many thousands of years ago in a land far away from
        Egypt. From the Gods of the underworld, Osiris and Anubis; to the Gods
        of light such as Amun-Ra and Horus; the lives and actions of the Gods of
        Ancient Egypt explain our very existence and our place in the universe.
        Prepare to experience the Real Gods of Egypt and the original Game of
        Thrones</image:caption
