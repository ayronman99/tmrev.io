        >Yup Yup Man is a schizophrenic street man who wants to become a crime
        crusader like Dark Justice, his favorite comic book. As he focuses on
        his crime fighting crusade, his delusional traits weaken, making him
        seem outwardly normal. In the end, he must choose between a destructive
        world of crime fighting or aspiring to grow his inherent
        goodness.</image:caption
