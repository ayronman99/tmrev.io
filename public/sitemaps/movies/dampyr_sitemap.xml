        >Haunted by nightmares, Harlan Draka wanders through the war-torn Balkan
        countryside, making money out of ridding superstitious villagers of
        imaginary monsters. But after being hired by soldiers who are under
        attack by actual vampires, Harlan discovers the truth: he's a Dampyr,
        half-human and half-vampire. While trying to stop a Master of the Night
        and his undead army, Harlan will have to learn to manage his newfound
        powers and uncover his origins.</image:caption
