        >Aviva, a hard-working hotel cook in the small northern Israeli town of
        Tiberias, is on the brink of finally fulfilling her lifelong dream. For
        years she kept her remarkable writing abilities under wraps, until her
        sister, Anita, introduces her to Oded, an accomplished novelist.
        Immediately recognizing Aviva's talent, Oded takes her under his wing,
        promising to help her achieve greatness. But the journey to greatness
        effects her life and the lives of her family - her unemployed husband,
        her trouble children, her unstable mother, and primarily her sister, a
        funny and sensitive woman who have her own dreams. When Aviva discovered
        that Oded has other plans for her work, her world
        collapses.</image:caption
