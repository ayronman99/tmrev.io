        >When unexplained earthquakes threaten planet Earth, it's up to Agent E
        to find out why. But the only clue he has is that a group of rabbis have
        been kidnapped. It's the fiendish Dr. Lo-Tov, of course, up to his old
        tricks, and only with the help of G-d, and some inspired classmates, can
        Agent Emes stop him and rescue the rabbis - and the world. This episode
        focuses on the importance of Torah learning, especially among Jewish
        children. Along the way, it delves into the way in which G-d created the
        world, and the responsibility the Jewish people have to help to maintain
        it.</image:caption
