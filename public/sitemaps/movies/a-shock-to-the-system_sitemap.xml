        >Madison Avenue executive Graham Marshall has paid his dues. A talented
        and devoted worker, he has suffered through mounting bills and a nagging
        wife with one thing to look forward to: a well-deserved promotion. But
        when the promotion is given to a loud-mouthed yuppie associate, Graham
        unleashes his rage on an overly aggressive panhandler, who he accidently
        kills by pushing him into the path of an oncoming subway train. He
        re-thinks his problems with an entirely new solution. First, he arranges
        an "accident" for his annoying wife. Then he creates another "mishap"
        for his boss. It seems like the world is once more Graham's oysterâ€¦but a
        missing cigarette lighter and a prying police detective may change all
        that.</image:caption
