        >Inspired by the unfortunate event of the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin
        we are proud to bring you the dramatic feature of Haim Bouzaglo, Blank
        Bullet. Amos Snir, the head of the Shin Bet, has just 60 hours during
        which time he must prevent the next political assassination. The year is
        2004 and the Prime Minister, Ariel Sharon, has recently announced his
        intention for Israel to disengage from the Gaza Strip. In the wake of
        the announcement Sharon has received numerous death threats and Snir has
        been trying to cancel all Sharon's public appearances. However, Sharon
        is determined to appear at the Yad VaShem Museum for the Holocaust
        Memorial Day Ceremony where he is to be the key speaker. The ceremony is
        due to take place in three days.</image:caption
