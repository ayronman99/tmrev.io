        >Cerise is fourteen years old but she looks twenty. Cerise grew up on
        the outskirts, but now she's exiled to Ukraine. Cerise wears excessive
        amounts of makeup, but she still has a little girl's dreams. Cerise
        doesn't know her father, even though she's going to have to live with
        him. Cerise has only ever thought about herself and now she finds
        herself in the middle of a revolution.</image:caption
