        >Sweet Tee, Alabama was a friendly town, Family Friendly. But Sweet Tee
        had a secret. You see, in the Tennessee River that flowed right through
        the middle of town, there lived some kind of a swamp monster. And it
        preferred the taste of human flesh over all others. A loser journalist,
        a burned-out hippie and a brainy scientist chick found themselves smack
        dab in the middle of this situation... and it was up to them to fix
        things.</image:caption
