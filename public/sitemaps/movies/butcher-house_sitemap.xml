        >In the 1960's at Arthur Kingston's old butcher house blood and guts
        were routine. That all changed one night when the blood spilled was
        human. At the hand of a murderous, rampaging butcher, two workers and
        the owner's son were killed. The factory was shut down. Decades pass.
        The massacre became a legend, but the abandoned butcher house still held
        the evil in its halls. As six teenagers explore the old butcher house,
        they unleash the horror that lies within.</image:caption
