        >Because of a serious motor disability, Claudia cannot move without
        being helped by her mother. At the age of 20 she is still a virgin and
        wonders what sexual pleasure could possibly be like. But one day Marco,
        a Love Giver, comes into her life. Marco has just attended the first
        course to help disabled people to discover their own bodies and
        sexuality, an unprecedented event, on the margins of legality. Supported
        by a team of specialists, Claudia and Marco embark on a series of
        meetings which become ever more intimate. However, the project is
        subject to protocol which includes a rule that is difficult to enforce:
        never fall in love.</image:caption
