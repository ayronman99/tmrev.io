        >Three sisters have spent years bracing themselves for the pivotal
        moment that opens this film: the final verdict in their trial against
        their cousin, their childhood sexual abuser. From there, the story
        returns to their memories of growing up in a large and insular
        Punjabi-Canadian family in the small mill town of Williams Lake, British
        Columbia. With unflinching candour, the sisters discuss their family's
        dark secrets and expose a toxic family culture that relied on female
        subservience and obedience. These roles, they acknowledge, have deeper
        roots and have in part been reinforced by the Bollywood films that have
        structured their fantasies of romantic relationships. While the film
        tells a difficult and confrontational story of abuse, it is also a
        celebration of the loving sisterhood that allows these women to demand
        justice for the wrongs of their childhood years.</image:caption
