        >The life and work of Robert Frank—as a photographer and a filmmaker—are
        so intertwined that they're one in the same, and the vast amount of
        territory he's covered, from The Americans in 1958 up to the present, is
        intimately registered in his now-formidable body of artistic gestures.
        From the early '90s on, Frank has been making his films and videos with
        the brilliant editor Laura Israel, who has helped him to keep things
        homemade and preserve the illuminating spark of first contact between
        camera and people/places. Don't Blink is Israel's like-minded portrait
        of her friend and collaborator, a lively rummage sale of images and
        sounds and recollected passages and unfathomable losses and friendships
        that leaves us a fast and fleeting imprint of the life of the Swiss-born
        man who reinvented himself the American way, and is still standing on
        ground of his own making at the age of 90.</image:caption
