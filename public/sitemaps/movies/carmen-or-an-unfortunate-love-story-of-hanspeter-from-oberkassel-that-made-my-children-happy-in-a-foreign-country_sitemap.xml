        >In the 1980s a middle class German boy falls in love with a travelling
        circus woman named Carmen, only to have his heart broken when she
        disappears. Trying to mend his broken heart, Hanspeter set up an amateur
        circus school in the backyard of his home, which became a refuge for the
        struggling kids. Nearly 40 years later journalist Yulia Vishnevetskaya
        crosses Germany in search of this fleeting woman who unknowingly created
        a powerful impact of a lasting legacy. A road movie with a flair of
        comedy and drama, this film is a tender reflection on the circus of
        life, love and the dying trade.</image:caption
