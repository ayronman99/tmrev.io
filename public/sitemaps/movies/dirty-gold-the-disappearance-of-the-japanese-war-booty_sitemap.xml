        >From 1937 to 1948 gold, silver, platinum and diamonds were looted by
        the Imperial Japanese Army during its campaigns throughout Asia-a
        treasure trove worth billions whose location has remained unclear until
        today. Rumor had it that hundreds of tones of gold were buried in the
        Philippines. In an exciting investigation of the 20th century history,
        director Egmont R. Koch embarks on the trail of Japanâ€™s stolen gold, a
        journey that takes him to the Philippines, Hong Kong and Japan. He
        discovers documents that prove that the disappeared loot was used to
        finance the Cold War in Asia and to corrupt nationalist Japanese
        politicians.</image:caption
