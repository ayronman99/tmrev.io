        >It all began quite suddenly. Akihito, who appears human but is actually
        half yomu with the power to quickly heal himself, sees a freshman girl
        who appears ready to jump from the school rooftop. The girl, Mirai, who
        has the ability to manipulate blood, which is unique even among members
        of the spirit world, continues to fight her isolation. Akihito decides
        at that moment to save Mirai, but disturbing events soon begin to
        unfold.</image:caption
