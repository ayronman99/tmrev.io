        >In Sicily, in a time not yet forgotten, in the heart of a small
        secluded town populated by cicadas, ticks and venomous snakes, that
        which made a man a real man was not riches or power, but his honor. He
        had to defend his dignity against insults and village gossip. It took
        little to stoke the fire once lit, and no one was immune. One of the
        worst humiliations a man can suffer was to have an adulterous wife. A
        man so disgraced would bear the mark of shame, with all eyes of the
        community upon him. It was said that "his horns were sticking out" for
        all to see.</image:caption
