        >In 1994, an economist decision by British Coal to close "Tower
        Colliery" in Aberdare (South Wales), convinced its miners boasting a
        generationally long history of political activism, that what they had
        was worth fighting for. In unanimous vote to buy out the company, every
        miner pledged 8,000Â£, many relinquishing severance pay. Then union
        leaders, Tyrone O'Sullivan and a few other miners, decided to become
        businessmen.</image:caption
