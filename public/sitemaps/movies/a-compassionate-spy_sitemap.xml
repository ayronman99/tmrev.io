        >Recruited in 1944 as an 18-year-old Harvard undergraduate to be the
        youngest physicist on the Manhattan Project, to create a bomb before the
        Germans did, Ted Hall didn’t share his colleagues’ elation after the
        successful detonation of the world’s first atomic bomb. Increasingly
        concerned during 1944—with Germany clearly losing the war—that a U.S.
        post-war monopoly on such a powerful weapon after the war could lead to
        nuclear catastrophe, he decided beginning that October to start passing
        key information about the bomb’s construction to the Soviet Union. After
        the war, at the University of Chicago, he met and married Joan, a fellow
        student with whom he shared a passion for classical music and socialist
        causes — and the explosive secret of his espionage. Living under a cloud
        of suspicion and years of FBI surveillance and intimidation, the pair
        raised a family while Ted refocused his scientific brilliance on
        groundbreaking bio-physics research.</image:caption
