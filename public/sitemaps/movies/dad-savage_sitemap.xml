        >A wealthy, successful, East-Anglian tulip grower, Dad Savage is also
        something of a godfather in the local criminal fraternity but doesn't
        trust banks to take care of his money. On recommendation from his son,
        Sav, Dad hires two of Sav's unemployed school friends, Bob and Vic, to
        help with the business and the crime. After some careless talk from
        Harold, just known as 'H', about Dad's pension fund, Vic and Bob decide
        to steal the money from Dad if they can find it. The plans to liberate
        the money go awry and Sav is killed requiring Bob to call upon his
        sister Chris to rescue them. Dad intercepts their escape and forces a
        showdown to try to determine exactly the events of the night in order to
        identify his son's killer.</image:caption
