        >Sua and Jib are like any other couple in this world except for one
        exception: for the past 5 years they have kept their relationship a
        secret since the bank where they are employed has a strict No
        Fraternization policy. It's not a big deal until they decide to get
        married. The only problem? Which one of these two Type-A overachievers
        will put marriage before a career and resign? With neither willing to
        take the leap of faith they both turn incident into opportunity when an
        ATM glitch in Chonburi province cashes out over $130,000
        baht.</image:caption
