        >Kane and Darren are two 'rag and bone men' who have lived in the outer
        suburb of Boronia all their lives. Now as they approach their early
        thirties, they decide that it is time to leave their comfortable suburb
        and travel the world for the first time. In order to do so the 'boronia
        boys' follow hard rubbish collections and help themselves to discarded
        rubbish and sell them overpriced at trash &amp; treasure
        markets.</image:caption
