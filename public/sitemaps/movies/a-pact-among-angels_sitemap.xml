        >A man finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time and witnesses
        a crime scene committed by two teenage brothers. He is immediately
        kidnapped by the boys who have gotten themselves into a big trouble.
        This launches the bizarre trio on a crazy journey that reveals each
        person’s true character. Linked by a common destiny, these three fragile
        individuals must overcome their prejudices and work together to survive.
        And when their journey is coming to an end, the man has to make a
        biggest decision in his life. Richard Angers’ first feature A Pact Among
        Angels is a road movie with a heartwarming story about strangers who
        have nobody else but each other. Richard Angers’ very detailed direction
        and the fine performances of Émile Schneider, Marc Messier, and
        Lenni-Kim make A Pact Among Angels one of the outstanding Canadian
        independent films this year.</image:caption
