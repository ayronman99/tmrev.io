        >Maltazard, the Evil M, is now 7 feet tall and evolving among the
        humans, causing terror wherever he goes. His goal is simple: forming an
        army of giant henchmen and ruling over the universe. Meanwhile, Arthur
        is still a Minimoy, and thus in a state where he's unable to fend him
        off. With the help of Selenia and Betameche, he hatches a plan to regain
        his usual size: all they must do is infiltrate Arthur's house through
        the pipeworks, catch an electric train from his bedroom to his
        grandfather's study and find an elixir that will make him grow back to
        his human size. Sounds simple enough, if it weren't for Darkos,
        Maltazard's own son, hot on their tails.</image:caption
