        >This docudrama travels back in time to 1963 to see how Doctor Who was
        first brought to the screen. Actor William Hartnell felt trapped by a
        succession of hard-man roles. Wannabe producer Verity Lambert was
        frustrated by the TV industry's glass ceiling. Both of them were to find
        unlikely hope and unexpected challenges in the form of a Saturday
        tea-time drama. Allied with a team of unusual but brilliant people, they
        went on to create the longest running science fiction series ever
        made.</image:caption
