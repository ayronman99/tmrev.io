        >Ostia, outskirts of Rome: the beach in winter. Two sixteen-year-old
        boys steal a scooter at 8 in the morning, then rob a store, all in time
        for getting to school at 9. Nader is Egyptian, but was born in Rome.
        Stefano is Italian and his best friend Brigitte, Nader’s girlfriend, is
        also Italian, but for this very reason Nader’s parents are against the
        match, and Nader runs away from home. The film describes a week in the
        life of a teenager who tries to subvert the values of his own family.
        Torn between his Arab and Italian identity, audacious and in love, like
        the hero of a contemporary fairy tale, Nader will have to put up with
        the cold, the loneliness, life on the street, hunger and fear, the
        flight from his enemies and the loss of his friends, before he can
        really understand who he is.</image:caption
