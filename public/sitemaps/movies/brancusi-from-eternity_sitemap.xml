        >3 stories, 3 characters and 3 periods of time are at the center of the
        film. The main story is about Brancusi's mature period, following his
        arrival in Paris, during his friendship with Modigliani and his
        relationship with Martha, his favorite model. The second story is about
        a Fine Arts student. Due to the massive criticism of some Romanian
        Academy members, who didn't recognize Brancusi's work first, he wanted
        to leave Romania and sent to prison for 13 years. After he's released
        the value of Brancusi's work has changed in Romania and now the former
        security forces him to forge some of Brancusi's works. The third story
        has at its center a great scholar who lived in Tibet in the XII century.
        He is the link between sculptor and forger, a link between their
        destinies</image:caption
