        >Armenian Belinda feels at home in Germany, where she was born, lives
        and studies just like any other German girl her age. But when she loses
        her father, she is suddenly drawn into the traditional Armenian
        lifestyle of her migrant relatives. Her aunts require her to work in
        their seamstress shop and secretly plot to marry her off to one of her
        kind. While Belinda is becoming increasingly curious about her roots,
        their traditional ways also threaten her relationship with Manuel, a
        German. She embarks on a journey into the past and the present to find
        out who she really is. ANDUNI shows a culture that is exciting and
        complex, and a love story that reaches beyond family
        traditions.</image:caption
