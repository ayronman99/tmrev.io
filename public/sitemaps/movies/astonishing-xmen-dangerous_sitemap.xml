        >The tragic death of a student at the Xavier Institute reveals that a
        powerful enemy is working from inside the mansion to destroy the X-Men,
        an enemy who knows all their weaknesses and can predict their every
        move. This new foe doesn’t want wealth, power or world domination: it
        only wants them dead. As the X-Men fight for their lives, they learn
        they’ve been deceived by one of their own . . . even if they survive,
        the team will never be the same.</image:caption
