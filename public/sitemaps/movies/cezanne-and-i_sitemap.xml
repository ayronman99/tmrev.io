        >They loved each other with the ardor of thirteen-year-old boys.
        Rebellion and curiosity, hopes and doubts, girls and dreams of glory â€“
        they shared it all. Paul was rich, Emile poor. They went skinny-dipping,
        drank absinthe, starved, only to overeat. Sketched models by day,
        caressed them by night... Now, Paul is a painter and Emile a writer.
        Glory has passed Paul by. But Emile has it all: fame, money, the perfect
        wife, whom Paul once loved. They judge each other, admire each other,
        confront each other. They lose touch, meet up again, like a couple who
        cannot stop loving each other.</image:caption
