        >It took only one night and a day. A night and a day to completely
        destroy what had been built up over centuries. Dresden, the Florence of
        the Elbe, a baroque work of art and one of the last cities, which had
        left by the bombing during the Second World War is still largely intact,
        sank in just 12 hours in rubble. At least 30,000 people were in a
        terrible fire storm end. The film depicts an example of the fate of the
        victims of this attack, the fate of Dresden but also that of the pilots,
        the fates of the survivors and those who could not escape the flames. He
        observed at the same time as it is happening in the British
        headquarters, the "Bomber Command". As a historical "real-time
        reportage" accompanies this award-winning documentary (Emmy Award-2005)
        with elaborate productions, the last 36 hours, in which Dresden, went
        back and put the audience into the events of the last months of World
        War II.</image:caption
