        >Kana, a young woman from Japan is pursuing her career in North America
        and has adapted to her new environment. However, her new lifestyle has
        made her emotionally distant and can't seem to sustain a long term
        relationship. Her mother calls informing Kana that grandma passed away.
        As Kana returns home to pay her respects, she begins to recall her most
        intimate conversation with grandma. In their talk, Grandma is proud of
        Kana for leaving Japan. Kana argues it's even harder to raise a family
        and sustain a marriage for a lifetime. Grandma tells Kana that their
        marriage was far from ideal, and to Kana's surprise, Grandma reveals a
        secret which changes Kana's attitudes on relationships. Memories and the
        funeral force Kana to look inside herself and examine her own
        life.</image:caption
