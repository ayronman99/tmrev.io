        >In Curuguazu, located in the Argentinian countryside, seventeen
        year-old Daniel Montero has been raised by his grandmother for three
        years since the death of his parents in a car accident. Daniel has a
        boring life, working in a poultry processing plant and meeting his
        friends in the square to make small talk. He saves some money from his
        salary and buys an old television, where he watches late night porn
        shows of Sabrina Love.</image:caption
