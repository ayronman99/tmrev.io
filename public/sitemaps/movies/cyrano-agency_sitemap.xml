        >The Cyrano Agency is a dating agency which helps people who can't date
        to have a love life. The agency staff try helping their clients without
        being noticed. The agency's representatives Byeong-hoon and Min-yeong
        are giving their best to pair up their client, Sang-yong, with his love
        interest named Hee-joong. But when Byeong-hun sees Hee-joong's profile,
        he begins to doubt their abilities. Will "Cyrano Agency" succeed in
        their mission?</image:caption
