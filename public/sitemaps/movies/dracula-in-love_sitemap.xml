        >Leila, a lonely young soul spends the night partying with her friends
        Nancy, David and Nash in a warehouse. As the boys drink up and smoke pot
        all social barriers between the sexes crumble. Leila, hit on by both
        men, hides away from them. Alone she senses there is someone else who
        wants her and certainly he is not of this world. A 200 year old Dracula
        escapes from a crate and reveals himself to Leila and tells her that she
        is his lost love. For him to live again and be with her, she must bring
        him the blood of her friends to drink and make love to him. Hypnotized
        by his sexual powers, Leila does as she is told. Leila and a handsome
        young Dracula get away and live happily ever after.</image:caption
