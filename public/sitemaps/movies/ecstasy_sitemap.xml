        >Eva has just gotten married to an older gentleman, but discovers that
        he is obsessed with order in his life and doesn't have much room for
        passion. She becomes despondent and leaves him, returning to her
        father's house. One day while bathing in the lake, she meets a young man
        and they fall in love. The husband has become grief stricken at the loss
        of his young bride, and fate brings him together with the young lover
        that has taken Eva from him.</image:caption
