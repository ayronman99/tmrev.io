        >Personalised instruments are used to transform loops of pure black and
        white frames into an immersive riot of perceptual phenomenon in colour,
        motion and sound. Bruce will employ four adapted 16mm projectors, the
        motors modified, brass grids retro-fitted between lens and gate. A
        stroboscopic and intense sensory overload of flashing abstract forms,
        cut to ribbons by modified projectors. You’re met with a white strobing
        circle pulsing on screen and slowly transformed as additional,
        overlapping projectors create strange halo’s and spheres, odd 3D
        expansions and contractions. As more projectors are added the image is
        shredded under a beating grid, color and form thrumming in front of your
        eyes until, as the last projector dims and you’re left in the dark,
        crazy blue tendrils follow your gaze, after-images burned on the retina
        like a delicate coda to Bruce’s performances. -Kill Your Timid Notion
