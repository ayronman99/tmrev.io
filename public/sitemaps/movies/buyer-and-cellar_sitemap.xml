        >In the basement of a house on her Malibu estate, Barbra Streisand
        created a private fantasy world to display her accumulated tchotchkes: a
        narrow, cobblestoned “street” of boutiques, from an antique doll store
        and confectionery with its own taffy-making machine to a dress shop
        filled with favorite costumes from her films. In this one-man comedy,
        Urie plays Alex More, who is down on his luck after being recently fired
        from Disneyland. He lands a job curating the basement of Barbra
        Streisand. Urie streamed this performance live from his own living room
        during the COVID-19 quarantine.</image:caption
