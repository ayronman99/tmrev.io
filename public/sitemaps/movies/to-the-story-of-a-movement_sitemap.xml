        >In the early 1970s, a group of secretaries in Boston decided that they
        had suffered in silence long enough. They started fighting back,
        creating a movement to force changes in their workplaces. This movement
        became national, and is a largely forgotten story of U.S. twentieth
        century history. It encapsulates a unique intersection of the women’s
        movement with the labor movement. The awareness these secretaries
        brought to bear on women’s work reverberates even today. Clericals were
        the low-wage workers of their era. America now confronts the growing
        reality of deep income inequality. The stories and strategies of these
        bold, creative women resonates in contemporary America.</image:caption
