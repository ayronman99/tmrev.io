        >The exhibition 'The Complete Letters' features epistolary works defined
        by cinematographic creation. This is an experimental communication
        format used between pairs of film directors. Although each director is
        situated in a location geographically distant from that of their
        partner, they are united by their willingness to share ideas and
        reflections on all that motivates their work. Within this space of
        freedom, the directors featured in the exhibition examine their
        affinities and differences, within an environment of mutual respect and
        simultaneity of interests and with notable formal variants established
        in each of the correspondences.</image:caption
