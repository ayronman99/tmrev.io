        >College student Durga (J D Chakravarthy) lives with his grandfather and
        shuns all violence. He also loves Gayathri, a fellow student whom he
        plans to marry, but her father is against the match. When a local don
        learns that Durga persists in pursuing the relationship against the
        wishes of Gayathri's father, he sends his henchmen to kill him --
        unleashing a storm of terror on Gayathri and her family.</image:caption
