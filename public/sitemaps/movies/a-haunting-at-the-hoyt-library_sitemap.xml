        >For years, the Hoyt Library has made headlines as one of the most
        haunted locations in the entire Midwest. Finally, a documentary film
        crew was allowed complete access to investigate the numerous claims of
        paranormal activity. What they captured on audio and video will leave no
        room for doubt. Rooted in the heart of downtown Saginaw, the historic
        Hoyt Library has guarded its citizens' history and lineage for over 125
        years. A literal gateway to the past, this stately and opulent landmark
        houses one of Michigan's largest collections of literature, artifacts,
        and documents... but according to patrons and staff, it also houses a
        collection of lost and restless souls.</image:caption
