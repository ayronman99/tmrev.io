        >Louise lives alone and seems to like it that way. She has been through
        a divorce and the recent death of her mother. Recently, she has moved to
        Annecy, a moderate-sized city, to take work as a schoolteacher. She
        encounters a much younger man, Luigi, an Italian who is down on his
        luck. Though he moved to France to find work, he was robbed of his money
        and papers and is stranded. When he helps her bury her dogs, which her
        neighbour has poisoned for barking, their relationship grows to a new
        level.</image:caption
