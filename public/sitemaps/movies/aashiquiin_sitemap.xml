        >Cyrus and April meet randomly online and they start getting close but
        they never reveal their true identities. But patience runs out and they
        finally decide to meet. Somehow April manages to find out his true
        identity but Cyrus fails to do so. April thinks that Cyrus is too good
        for her and tries to sulk away in the fear of rejection whereas Cyrus
        looks for her everywhere as she was the only one who could understand
        him as a friend and as a lover. Will Cyrus and April finally meet? Will
        Cyrus accept April for what she really is? Will April find the courage
        to be herself and claim the life she's always wanted?</image:caption
