        >Dia is a divorced mom living in New York and must go back to India
        after she receives news that her guru is on his death bed. When she
        arrives she finds he is gone and has left her the responsibility of
        saving and reviving the Ajanta Theater where she used to dance. The
        problem is that the political officers want it torn down and turned into
        a shopping mall. The storyline follows Dia and her challenge to stand up
        for what she believes in and fight the cause to the end, while trying to
        win back the love and support of the people of the town whom she walked
        out on ten years prior.</image:caption
