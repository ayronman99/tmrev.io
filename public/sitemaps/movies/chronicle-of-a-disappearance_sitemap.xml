        >Chronicle of a Disappearance unfolds in a series of seemingly
        unconnected cinematic tableaux, each of them focused on incidents or
        characters which seldom reappear later in the film. Among the many
        unrelated scenes, there is a Palestinian actress struggling to find an
        apartment in West Jerusalem, the owner of the Holy Land souvenir shop
        preparing merchandise for incoming Japanese tourists, a group of old
        women gossiping about their relatives, and an Israeli police van which
        screeches to a halt so several heavily armed soldiers can get off the
        car and urinate.</image:caption
