        >"A Home On The Range" tells the little-known story of Jews who fled the
        pogroms and hardships of Eastern Europe and traveled to California to
        become chicken ranchers. Even in the sweatshops of New York they heard
        about Petaluma where the Jews were not the shopkeepers and the
        professionals, they were the farmers. Meet this fractious, idealistic,
        intrepid group of Eastern European Jews and their descendants as they
        confront obstacles of language and culture on their journey towards
        becoming Americans. Jack London, California vigilantes, McCarthyism, the
        Cold War and agribusiness all come to life in this quintessentially
        American story of how a group of immigrants found their new home, a home
        on the range.</image:caption
