        >A documentary about the legendary jazz singer Billie Holiday
        (1915-1959). There exist many myths and legends about the Jazz Singer
        Billie Holiday â€” one of the greatest voices of the last century. Most of
        them tell the story of the tragic victim of drugs, alcohol, men, color,
        or the circumstances of her upbringing. To some extent she contributed
        herself to these legends, especially in her autobiography "Lady Sings
        the Blues". In recent years, more and more records and reports have
        shown a different picture of her. These statements of confidants,
        colleagues and friends clean up with many of the legends and show a
        strong personality who has been anything but a pitiable victim. Billie
        Holiday was a strong-willed and determined person and a very complex
        personality who did not correspond to the classic victim
        type.</image:caption
