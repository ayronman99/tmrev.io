        >Paul Liebrandt is one of the most talented and controversial chefs in
        the food world and the youngest chef to have received 3 stars from the
        New York Times. He was 24. NY Times food critic, William Grimes, likened
        Paul to 'a pianist who seems to have found a couple of dozen extra
        keys.' Through Paul, the film reveals the creative process, the extreme
        hard work, long hours, and dedication it takes to be a culinary artist
        and have success in the cutthroat world of haute cuisine. Exploring the
        complicated relationships between food critics, chefs, and owners the
        film delves into the life of a dedicated young chef ahead of his
        time.</image:caption
