        >Nicole Barnes gets the toughest assignment of her career when she’s
        asked to handle a breaking scandal for former pro
        footballer-turned-TV-commentator Jordan Davies, whose network contract
        isn’t going to be renewed because of a violation going back to his
        college days. However, Nicole fails to disclose that she and Jordan were
        once boyfriend and girlfriend — a conflict of interest that could end
        her own hopes of being made partner at her firm. To make matters worse,
        Nicole’s efforts to rehabilitate Jordan’s image are constantly
        undermined by Jordan’s shallow entertainment reporter
        fiancée.</image:caption
