        >Already famous, at the top of his career, owner of his own school of
        etiquette, Crô sees himself alone and without a family. Lonely and
        vulnerable, he ends up living at the whim of supposed family, Orlando,
        Marinalva, Luane and Nando, whose intentions are far from the best. With
        the inseparable Geni, Magda and Jurema by his side, Crô will embark on
        an adventure to find his true family while constantly avoiding the venom
        of the top columnist Carlota Valdez.</image:caption
