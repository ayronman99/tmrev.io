        >Little kids, big dreams and smashingly good music – Dixieland follows
        the amazing progress of four members of a Ukrainian children’s brass
        band from Kherson. Through steady practice under the wildest of
        conditions, Roman (12, trumpet), Polina (10, trombone, drums and many
        other instruments), Nikita (12, drums) and Nikita (14, piano) produce
        magical music with ancient, wobbly instruments. Not least due to their
        wit and good humor, they persevere together, helped along by their
        80+-year-old conductor and a young teacher. These children of the
        post-Soviet provinces use American tunes to achieve their dream – to
        become someone in the world and make something of their lives, no matter
        how dire the circumstances. From the authors of an awards winning
        documentary film Ukrainian Sheriffs.</image:caption
