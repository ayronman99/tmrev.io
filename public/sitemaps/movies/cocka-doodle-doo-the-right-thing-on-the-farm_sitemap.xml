        >It doesn't take long to realize that On the Farm with Farmer Bob is not
        just any ol' farm. The characters from On the Farm with Farmer Bob are
        already nationally known, as they have been used as teaching tools in
        public school programs and science museums. In Cocka Doodle Doo The
        Right Thing a special guest has been invited to the farm. Jenny (voice
        of Amy Grant) is put in charge of cleaning up and receives the
        cooperation of everyone, except Hercules (Vince Gill). In addition to
        not helping, Hercules mistakes the special guest for someone unimportant
        and treats him poorly. Meanwhile Sam finds $20 and spends it without
        finding out to whom it belongs. This episode teaches the Biblical
        parable of the Pharisee and the Tax Collector as well as the practical
        lesson of doing the right thing.</image:caption
