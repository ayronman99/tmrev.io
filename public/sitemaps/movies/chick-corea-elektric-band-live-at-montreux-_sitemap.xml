        >Chick Corea is one of the most significant jazzmen of recent times. He
        first came to notice as a keyboard player for Miles Davis in the late
        sixties and early seventies before founding his own jazz-fusion band
        Return To Forever with Stanley Clarke, which started the career of Al Di
        Meola. In more recent times he has been operating as either the Chick
        Corea Akoustic Band or, as in this case, the Chick Corea Elektric Band.
        The band line-up features Corea on keyboards, John Patitucci on bass,
        Frank Gambale on guitar, Dave Weckl on drums and Eddie Marienthal on
        sax.</image:caption
