        >This documentary deals with the stories, achievements and difficulties
        of women boxers and footballers. Their stories are told from the point
        of view of their daily lives where sport, family live and relationships
        intermingle in a complex and often contradictory whole. All these women
        share the desire to triumph in sports normally considered to be menÂ´s
        sports. Some of them pursue their dream while working at other jobs such
        as driving taxis, selling tacos or being lawyers. They are not women
        victims, trapped in the family or in marriage; for the simple reason
        that they are still fighting, they have not accepted defeat. This
        documentary looks at the feminine aspect of these sports and the
        unfairness that there is.</image:caption
