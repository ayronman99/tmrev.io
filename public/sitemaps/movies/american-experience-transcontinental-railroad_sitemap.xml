        >Documentary filmmakers offer a fascinating look at one of the most
        spectacular engineering feats of the 19th Century as the story of the
        Transcontinental Railroad comes to life in a film that's sure to appeal
        to historians and railroad enthusiasts alike. As legions of tireless
        workers toiled for six years to realize the vision of shady
        entrepreneurs and imaginative engineers, the remarkable railway dream
        slowly became a reality. But not everyone was so pleased with the
        remarkable achievement. Despite the devastating effect that the
        tremendous transportation breakthrough would have on the Native American
        population, the lasting impact of the Transcontinental Railroad on the
        politics and culture of a rapidly expanding country would forever mark
        it as an invaluable component of the American success
        story.</image:caption
