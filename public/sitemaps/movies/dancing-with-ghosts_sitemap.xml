        >Yoo-jin appears in the dreams of Dong-jae who is a host for lonely
        women at night. She appears in real life, asking him for help. What she
        needs is to sleep with him once. Yoo-jin was a virgin ghost and she
        needed Dong-jae to help her to go back to the after world. However, he
        doesn't want to sleep with her because she used to be his crush and he'd
        been waiting to see her in his dreams and in real life. He is afraid
        sleeping with her will make him lose her. Will he sleep with her or
        continue to live with her like this?</image:caption
