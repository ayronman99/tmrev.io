        >Two scientists return to the Oxford Museum of Natural History, the
        famed site of the 1860 Evolution debate between Huxley and Wilberforce.
        Discussing an issue the BBC calls "as fierce as ever," the two go head
        to head in a remarkable match of intellect. Holding the Atheistic
        position is Prof. Richard Dawkins, celebrated author of The God Delusion
        and regarded by many as the spokesman for the "New Atheism." Opposing
        Dawkins is fellow Oxford professor John Lennox. Lennox, like Dawkins,
        has dedicated his career to science, but arrives at very different
        conclusions.</image:caption
