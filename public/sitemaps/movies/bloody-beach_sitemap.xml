        >A group of Internet chatters decides to spend the summer together at a
        beach, renting an apartment and trying to know each other for real (or
        maybe they just want to have sex). Apparently a guy named "Sandmanz"
        committed suicide when he was ousted from the chatroom, and the group
        has split opinions on the matter. Some think he was just a psycho with
        no life, and he had it coming. Some others, like Yoo-na (the one who got
        closer to him), think that someone spread lies to force him to quit.
        Suddenly, the group is decimated by a mysterious figure who keeps
        e-mailing everyone that his/her fate will not be unlike Sandmanz's. The
        search for the killer begins, while people die right and left.
