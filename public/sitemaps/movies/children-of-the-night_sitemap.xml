        >17 years-old Giulio is sent by his mother to a boarding school for
        difficult offspring of rich families. The institution is sort of a
        “golden prison”, isolated in the Alps, to which inadequate parents
        delegate the task of educating the ruling class of the future. In this
        cold and ghastly place the boys are cut off from everything. Adhering to
        the strict rules of the boarding school is hard, but Giulio finds a good
        friend in Edoardo, who is maybe a little crazy, but who seems the
        smartest of all. They find out that security becomes more relaxed at
        night and they start running away to a nightclub in the middle of the
        woods. There they meet Elena, a young prostitute whose destiny will be
        unforgettably linked to theirs. The night is a space of freedom, of new
        and perturbing experiences for Giulio and Edoardo. But what they don’t
        know is that their transgressions are part of the educational program of
        the school.</image:caption
