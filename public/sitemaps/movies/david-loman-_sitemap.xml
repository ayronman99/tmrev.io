        >Now retired from the criminal underworld, Loman runs a bed and
        breakfast with his loud, boisterous family. The plot is built around
        various domestic situations - a relationship crisis between Loman's
        daughter Jin and her partner Xiao Ho, as well as unresolved issues
        between David's wife and her younger sister Hottie. Hong Kong's big boss
        Brother Tien soon arrives to meddle in everyone's
        affairs.</image:caption
