        >Legendary conductor and pianist Daniel Barenboim speaks more candidly
        than he has ever done before about his life and music. Told entirely
        through interviews with the maestro, the film starts with his earliest
        musical experiences as a child piano prodigy in Buenos Aires, before
        following his meteoric rise to fame, including his encounters with other
        musical giants such as Nadia Boulanger and Arthur Rubinstein, who gave
        the 14-year-old Daniel his first vodka and cigar! We also learn of
        Barenboim's move to Israel when he was a teenager, where he lived a
        double life as a musical genius and an ordinary schoolboy. He then talks
        with unusual intimacy about his relationship with cellist Jacqueline du
        Pre and her long battle with multiple sclerosis. The film also charts
        Barenboim's stellar career as an orchestral conductor, his move into
        opera and the founding of the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra with Edward
        Said.</image:caption
