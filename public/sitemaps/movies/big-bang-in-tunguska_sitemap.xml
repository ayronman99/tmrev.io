        >At 7:14 am on 30 June 1908, the largest explosion recorded in human
        history to date reverberated throughout our planet. The force of the
        explosion was two thousand times that of the Hiroshima bomb. A woodland
        area the size of Luxembourg was eradicated in the Siberian taiga. This
        incident is recorded in history books as the Tunguska catastrophe. To
        this day, internationally renowned scientists of various disciplines
        argue about the causes of this disastrous explosion. The documentary
        discusses the latest and most controversial insights of these leading
        scientists. It identifies the reasons why Tunguska has evolved into a
        phenomenon and points out the curious results produced by this mythical
        event in culture and economy.</image:caption
