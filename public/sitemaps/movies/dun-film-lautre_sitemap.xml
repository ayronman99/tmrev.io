        >On April 13, 2011, Les Films 13 production company turned 50. How can
        one celebrate an anniversary of this sort ? By simply making "another"
        film that would sum up all the earlier ones. D'un film à l'autre is
        hence a kind of anthology of the films produced Les Films 13 since the
        1960s (short and feature films written and directed for the main part by
        Claude Lelouch), a best-of of half a century of cinema, going from Le
        Propre de l'homme to What Love May Bring. A biography in images of a
        filmmaker as admired as he is criticized. In reality, D'un film à
        l'autre is more than a series of film excerpts, interviews, and
        making-of documents (some of which possess an undeniable historical
        value, like that from A Man and A Woman, or the final performances of
        Patrick Dewaere).</image:caption
