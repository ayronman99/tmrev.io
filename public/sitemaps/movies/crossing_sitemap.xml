        >Yong-soo is an ex-soccer player who lives in a small coal-mine village
        in North Korea with his wife and young son, Joon. Although living in
        extreme poverty like many other families in North Korea, the family is
        happy just to be with each other. Then one day, Yong-soo's pregnant wife
        becomes critically ill. Let alone medicine, Yong-soo can't even find
        food for her in North Korea. So he decides to secretly cross the border
        to China hoping to find the medicine for his wife.</image:caption
