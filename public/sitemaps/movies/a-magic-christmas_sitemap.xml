        >Jack Carter, a man constantly living in a state of regret, takes his
        technology-obsessed family, including their lovable dog Buster, on a
        Christmas vacation to the mountains in the hopes of reconnecting with
        them. While on vacation, Jack and his family run into an estranged,
        uber-competitive friend of Jack's, who now lives the life of luxury Jack
        pines for. Through a series of juvenile competitions, Jack realizes that
        the love of his family is more rewarding than anything money could
        buy.</image:caption
