        >Tensions is high at a long deserted summer camp where an independent
        slasher movie is being filmed. With the clock counting down and very
        little time for re-shoots the cast and crew are at each other's throats.
        Literally! What began as minor on-set differences became grounds for a
        unscripted bloodbath. No need for special effects when there is a
        machete wielding psychopath around. Non-stop action, excessive violence,
        and who could forget lesbians make Camp Death a must see for any horror
        fan. Get ready because there is a new face in horror! .....And you
        thought slashers died in the 80's!</image:caption
