        >Winter 2009. Following a suicide attempt by her depressed mother,
        Clément (26 years old) agrees to go to the sea with her in the family
        apartment so that she can get better. Only Clément also has his own
        life: a rather possessive girlfriend and above all a new job waiting for
        him. How is he going to "save" his mother, who tries to become the
        director of her son's life through all kinds of emotional blackmail? How
        can he cut the umbilical cord with his mother when she is suffering and
        depressed? Translated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free
