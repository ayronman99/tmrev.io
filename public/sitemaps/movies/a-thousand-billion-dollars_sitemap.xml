        >A young journalist stumbles across something much more sinister than a
        simple suicide in the death of a politician - the death seems to be an
        assassination contrived by an American multinational company intent on
        taking over several French industries. The journalist's objective is to
        garner enough evidence to expose the American corporation for what it
        really is, before French companies start disappearing - and before any
        more corpses accumulate, including his own.</image:caption
