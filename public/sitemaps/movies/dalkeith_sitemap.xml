        >Tells the true story of the residents at Dalkeith Residential Home who
        sit around every day just waiting to die until staff buy them a
        greyhound. Naming the dog Dalkeith after the home, they discover she is
        a phenomenal runner and she is soon entered into the greyhound races.
        Soon residents are betting on the outcome of the races, and they are
        given a new reason to live. But the board of trustees learn what is
        going on, through the disgruntled daughter of one of the residents, and
        heavily handedly put an end to the fun and games. After the board's
        intervention the residents sink into a new form of despair as life
        becomes even duller and more boring than before. That is until the aloof
        pensioner, played by Ray Barrett, reveals he was once a high profile
        barrister and challenges the decision in court.</image:caption
