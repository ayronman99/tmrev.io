        >Tai is 17 years old. Naim is 20. She's Israeli. He's Palestinian. She
        lives in Jerusalem. He lives in Gaza. They were born in a land of
        scorched earth, where fathers bury their children. They must endure an
        explosive situation that is not of their choosing at an age where young
        people are falling in love and taking their place in adult life. A
        bottle thrown in the sea and a correspondence by email nurture the
        slender hope that their relationship might give them the strength to
        confront this harsh reality to grapple with it, and thereby ever so
        slightly change it. Only 60 miles separate them but how many bombings,
        check-points, sleepless nights and bloodstained days stand between
        them?</image:caption
