        >Since the 1960s this iconic invididual has been turning the art world
        on its head. In the early days of pop art and during the birth of the
        conceptual movement Billy Apple created works that were original,
        challenging, and controversial. From New Zealand to the Royal College of
        Art in London and his own gallery in New York, Apple was part of a
        generation that pushed the boundaries of what it meant to be an artist.
        Along the way he created a brand that may one day end up on supermarket
        shelves.</image:caption
