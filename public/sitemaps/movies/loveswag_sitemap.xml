        >In this risqu√© urban romantic comedy, Bronson is a legendary-mogul who
        is able to bed women at will until he develops an embarrassing medical
        condition that renders his mastery in the bedroom unacceptable with the
        ladies. On his way to getting his swagger back -- restoring his name--
        and redeeming his company's respectability, will he have to run-out on
        the only woman eager to stay by his side and nurse him back to
        health?</image:caption
