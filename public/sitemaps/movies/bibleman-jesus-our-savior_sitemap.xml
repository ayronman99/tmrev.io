        >In this combined feature of Jesus, Our Savior Parts 1 and 2, we are
        introduced to the most sinister, most evil villain, Primordious Drool.
        Drool knows he cannot win against Bibleman on is own and has a plan to
        fight our favorite superhero. He intends to make Bibleman fight against
        himself. Drool drives the citizens of Andersonville to trust in Bibleman
        instead of God. Bibleman faces is toughest challenge ever as he has to
        explain to the townspeople that they cannot look to him as a superhero
        to save them. They must look to God, for only God can answer their
        prayers.</image:caption
