        >Belfast, Christmas 1999. A poor, badly dressed woman is half walking,
        half stumbling down the road. She is tearful and her behaviour is so
        disturbed that passers-by look furtively at her before hurrying on. Her
        walk is purposeful though. She is hurrying to go somewhere specific. She
        stumbles towards a church that is lit up. As she approaches it we see a
        sign outside announcing "SERVICE FOR PEACE Belfast Christmas together.
        All Denominations, 8pm"</image:caption
