        >Documentary about a political episode during the Brazilian military
        dictatorship, which resulted in the issue of the Institutional Act #5
        (AI-5), abolishing freedom of opinion in Brazil, and marking the
        transition to the toughest period of violation of human rights in the
        country. The episode was the Congress Assembly on December 12th, 1968,
        in which its members denied permission to punish congressman Márcio
        Moreira Alves, as was the Government's wish.</image:caption
