        >A gifted high-school student flubs her college admissions interviews
        for the most unexpected reasons in this independent coming-of-age drama.
        Cynical, world-weary Evie is more interested in taking care of her
        family than getting into the Ivy League institutions for which she seems
        destined. Dad Harry spends all his time building model trains in the
        basement, while workaholic mom Martha depends on Evie to take care of
        her other daughter, developmentally challenged Emily. When she's not
        busy reading poetry to her sister Emily, Evie hangs out with James (Fran
        Kranz), the sensitive boy next door, whose romantic overtures prove too
        confusing to acknowledge. College also seems too daunting, so Evie
        deliberately blows one university interview after another in the hopes
        of staying at home as her sister's keeper. Meanwhile, Evie begins
        passing off her own poems as Emily's, fuelling the belief that her
        brain-damaged sister is actually a literary savant.</image:caption
