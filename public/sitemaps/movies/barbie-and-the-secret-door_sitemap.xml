        >It's the ultimate fairytale musical! Barbie stars as Alexa, a shy
        princess who discovers a secret door in her kingdom and enters a
        whimsical land filled with magical creatures and surprises. Inside,
        Alexa meets Romy and Nori, a mermaid and a fairy, who explain that a
        spoiled ruler named Malucia is trying to take all the magic in the land.
        To her surprise, Alexa has magical powers in this world, and her new
        friends are certain that only she can restore their magic. Discover what
        happens when Alexa finds the courage to stand up for what's right and
        learns that the power of friendship is far more precious than
        magic.</image:caption
