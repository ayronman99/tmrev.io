        >All Norah ever wanted to be was a reality TV star. But her
        dream-come-true quickly turns into a nightmare when she allows a motley
        television crew of chickens, led by a sociopath, 'Charlie Chicken', to
        invade her home, manipulate her emotions, and drag her and her
        soon-to-be-ex-boyfriend into the desert on what is supposed to be a
        glamorous reality TV shoot. Deep in the surreal landscapes of the Joshua
        Tree desert, it becomes a battle of species. The hilarious antics of the
        oddball chicken crew, the blind faith of a reality TV star wannabe, and
        the cruel perversions of one really 'bad chicken', all spiral downward
        into an extremely unique Spaghetti Western.</image:caption
