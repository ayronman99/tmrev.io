        >Sixteen-year-old Joanna has been living with her overbearing Aunt
        Martha in a low-income NYC tenement building ever since a violent
        outburst left her fighting a feeling she can only describe as the
        "darkness." Little did she know that weeks after moving in, a biological
        threat from the Soviet Union would leave the building boarded up and the
        tenants locked inside. It's been one month since they were first
        sequestered. With food dwindling and Martha's controversial role as
        leader expanding, Joanna realizes that she must face both her darkness
        and her aunt in order to save the tenants. But can she take on the
        leadership without letting the darkness take over her
        entirely?</image:caption
