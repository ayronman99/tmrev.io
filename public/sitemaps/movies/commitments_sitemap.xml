        >This romance story focuses on Fox Giovanni (V.Dillard) who is a
        hardworking; overly competitive stockbroker who thinks money is the most
        important thing in life. Her health suffers from that and she ends up
        having to take time off and spend time away from the hustle and bustle
        of New York City. She heads south to reconnect with her estranged foster
        mother, finds out something about family and true love. She ends up
        falling in love with Van (A. Payne). It's really a good love story about
        two people who really don't want to be in love, but it's kind of forced
        on them. It's a situation that neither one of them want to have that
        experience of being vulnerable or in love.</image:caption
