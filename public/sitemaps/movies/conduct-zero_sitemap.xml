        >When Joong-Pil, the biggest bully in his high-school by far finds
        himself harboring feelings for a classmate, his entire identity is
        thrown off balance. Suddenly his smoking, his drinking, his constant
        swearing and his habit of pushing underclassmen into walls don't seem

        how.</image:caption
