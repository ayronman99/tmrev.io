        >2021 - 5 years after the outbreak of a mysterious virus that turned
        humans into bloodthirsty, undead beasts much of the world’s population
        has been decimated. When governments were unable to keep the disease at
        bay, the Contagion Special Unit was formed with the toughest soldiers
        and best specialists to fight the infected. Because of the rapidly
        decreasing number of soldiers, a popular online video game Dead Trigger
        that mirrors the terrifying events was created. The best efforts of the
        gamers are monitored by the CSU who recruit the highest rated zombie
        killers. The young recruits are called “Dead Triggers”. The movie
        follows a group of young recruits who must travel to the origin of the
        outbreak to find a missing team of scientists who were searching for a
        cure.</image:caption
