        >Bucky Pizzarelli leads a strong quintet through this intimate live set
        at Makor, a Manhattan night spot. The seven-string guitarist is always
        game for anything, and with a superb group -- including nearly
        everyone's first-call bassist, Michael Moore, clarinetist Allan Vach√©,
        vibraphonist Peter Appleyard (who previously worked with Benny Goodman,
        as did Michael Moore and the leader), and drummer Bernard "Pretty"
        Purdie -- the veteran leads his group through seven favorites from the
        swing era. The set sounds very relaxed and informal, as if the musicians
        were playing for their own fun and had no idea tapes were rolling. A
        snappy take of "Perdido" and an extended workout of "Limehouse Blues"
        are but two of the memorable tracks recorded that
        evening.</image:caption
