        >Giacomo Meyerbeer's pastoral opera,based on a Breton tale, is the tale
        of DINORAH who has gone mad because her bridegroom Hoël has disappeared
        during their wedding. This production, performed as part of Théâtre
        Impérial de Compiegne's purpose of reviving obscure French opera, is the
        only version of 'Dinorah' available on DVD, but it is a great
        production! The painterly pastoral settings and décor and rustic
        costumes are very easy on the eye. Opera traditionalists who dislike
        modern stagings will be delighted to know that this is a traditional
        production. Pierre Jourdan's stage direction is charming and always
        involving, never once falling into static movements or gestures,
        gratuitous distaste and irrelevance. With Isabelle Philippe, Armand
        Arapian and Frédéric Mazzotta. Conducted by Olivier
        Opebeek.</image:caption
