        >The film is based on a series of novels by Stas Dombrowski, a former
        drug addict and criminal who learned that he was HIV positive in 17
        years, and plunged into absolute self-destruction for next two decades.
        Only on his deathbed in prison therapy, knowing that he would die in two
        weeks, Stas understood that he wants to live more than anything in this
        world.</image:caption
