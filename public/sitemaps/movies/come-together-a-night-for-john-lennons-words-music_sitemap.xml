        >Come Together: A Night for John Lennon's Words and Music was a 2001
        television program tribute to John Lennon. It aired on TNT and The WB.
        Originally planned to celebrate Lennon's accomplishments, the concert
        took place on October 2, 2001 at Radio City Music Hall in New York City,
        shortly after 9/11, and exactly one week before the 61st anniversary of
        Lennon's birth. It was dedicated to "New York City and its people" and
        presented as a fundraiser for the Robin Hood Foundation.[1] The concert
        was named for Lennon's Beatles song, "Come Together".</image:caption
