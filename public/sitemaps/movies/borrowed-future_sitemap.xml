        >There's a massive student loan crisis in America. Millions have found
        themselves buried beneath a mountain of debt. Entire generations are
        trapped. Borrowed Future uncovers the dark side of the student loan
        industry and exposes how the system is built to work against you. We
        meet a group of high school students as they're about to make one of the
        biggest financial decisions of their lives, and then the other side: the
        reality for adults living with student loan debt. Do 17-year-olds really
        understand their financial decisions today will affect the future in
        front of them? Borrowed Future proves that you really do have the power
        to beat the student loan system - but it's up to you. You get to decide
        to feed the system or fight back.</image:caption
