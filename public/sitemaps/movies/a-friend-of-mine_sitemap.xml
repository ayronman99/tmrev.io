        >70-year-old Mati is a passionate bibliophile whose job is his hobby -
        heÂ´s got a job at the library. The rest of his little time he shares
        with his sweet wife. Then one sudden day death comes to his spouse. A
        whole life of stability crashes. Neither his adolescent daughter nor his
        dear books are of any help. Loneliness and indifference overrun his life
        and Mati plots his suicide. A strange 60-year- old wayfarer, Sass, who
        travels with a backpack of books and frequents public libraries to read
        the newspapers, brings forth a change. Bit by bit he starts to provide
        Mati with an interest in life again. "A Friend of Mine" is a warm
        expression of solitude and friendship, which helps us to overcome the
        bleakest periods of life.</image:caption
