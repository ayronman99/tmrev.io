        >What would you do if one day you open the door of your house and a man
        you've never seen hits you, ties you to a chair, pulls out a bottle of
        tequila and start counting you his life? In addition, little by little,
        you start to realize that this seemingly odd man knows everything about
        you and his main intent is to give you a shot in the head. Based on true
        events, this is what happens to Michael, an attorney/deputy happily
        married to a privileged life who in less than an hour starts to lose
        everything. Perhaps this stranger comes to present him something that
        everybody wants to have: Power. "Behind the Power" is a thriller that
        will make you question your country, your life and your
        heart.</image:caption
