        >Caleb Gare (Sam Shepard) is a farmer obsessed with owning as much land
        as he can and controlling his entire family. This becomes more
        complicated when a beautiful visiting teacher moves into the Gare home
        and she becomes involved in a battle of wills. To complicate matters
        more, a deep secret held by Caleb's wife will have to come to the
        surface. With the family at the breaking point, they must put aside
        their differences to bring in the year's harvest, after which they
        celebrate at the town's annual festival. Little does Caleb suspect that
        the one night of celebration will end in disaster, turmoil, and forever
        change the family.</image:caption
