        >After a decade of bitter rival status, Kelly Slater and Andy Irons come
        together to surf off their differences! To get two seemingly mortal
        enemies to agree to sequester themselves on a tiny island with a half
        dozen camera men, a Hollywood interviewer capable of conjuring up tears
        during any interview, and an in-the-know magazine staff waiting with
        bated breath seemed like a ridiculous notion. The end result was a ten
        day purge of feelings, emotional baggage, dispelling rumors, talking it
        out, and a burying of the hatchet once and for all. Oh, and we forgot to
        mention that the waves were insane! Check out the documentary of two of
        the best surfers and biggest rivals of our sport battle it out in an
        epic boat trip in Indonesia.</image:caption
