        >Five university friends gather at a house party to ring in the New
        Year. Unbeknownst to them, an epidemic has erupted outside, causing
        outbreaks around the world. With nowhere else to turn, they barricade
        themselves indoors with only their phones, laptops, and other tech
        devices. They use their devices to research the possible cause of this
        outbreak. Information and video footage over flow their computers as
        they descend further into the cause and the ensuing chaos. As the virus
        spreads, the mood in the house changes from fear to paranoia. Who is
        safe? Who can they trust? Reality becomes blurred as they slowly
        discover the source of the virus causing the sickness...and there is no
        going back.</image:caption
