        >December 1942. Two young soldiers leave their posts at checkpoint 83 in
        North Värmland, Sweden and make their way through the ice cold winter
        night towards the Nazi-occupied Norwegian border. Sweden stands on the
        brink of invasion and they want to see the enemy everybody's talking
        about. But the adventure ends in disaster and soon thereafter Lieutenant
        Aron Stenström finds out that his brother Sven is one of the missing
        soldiers. With the odds stacked against him he is forced to go behind
        enemy lines on a secret rescue mission. Deep inside the Norwegian
        forests Aron realizes that a completely different kind of line must be
        crossed if they're to come out alive.</image:caption
