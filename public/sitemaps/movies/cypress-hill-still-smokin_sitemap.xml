        >Still Smokin' is a comprehensive collection of promos from Hip-Hop's
        "vatos locos", Cypress Hill, spanning the whole of their 10-year,
        seven-album career. Following a brace of songs recorded live at San
        Francisco's Fillmore Theatre, this selection settles into a tried and
        tested promo formula for half of its running time, using ghetto-real
        grainy footage of the moody trio stalking inner city streets. "When the
        Ship goes Down" branches out into conceptual territory with a
        three-minute epic concerning internecine gang warfare that breaks up the
        band's performance. On "Dr Greenthumb" they play on their Furry Freak
        Brothers of rap stereotype in the setting of a green-fingered General
        Hospital. "(Rock) Superstar" sees a Cypress fan winning a Willy
        Wonka-style ride through their Hall of Mirrors, where he is transformed
        into a bona fide, gold lame-wearing rock star. Set in a derelict
        warehouse, the hardcore romp of "Can't Get the Best of Me" is
        reminiscent of Fight Club's basement brawls.</image:caption
