        >Pleun from Rotterdam has been running Casa Coco, a guest house for
        reflection and rest on Bonaire, for years. The Rotterdam people from her
        own circle of acquaintances like to come over for a wonderful holiday
        together. This autumn, Pleun's childhood sweetheart Toon comes along
        with a befriended couple after his wife announces she wants to divorce
        him, to make him forget his problems under the Antillean sun. The two
        ex-lovers have not seen each other for years. Because Pleun left Toon
        out of the blue fifty years ago and went to Bonaire, Toon falls back
        from one problem to another.</image:caption
