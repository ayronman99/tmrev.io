        >Homicide cop Ray Maldonado has found a third dead hooker in as many
        days. The realization that he's got a serial killer on his hands hits
        him. Wanting to stop the string of murders, Maldonado turns to the
        obvious suspect: Street preacher Jimmy Christmas. Searching for
        redemption from his past life of crime, Christmas wants the hookers he
        protects off the streets. But his prayers aren't enough. To hide the
        darkness of his past. Protect his girls. Fend off the anger of
        mysterious pimp Anthony and Anthony's lawyer Phillip. Jimmy knows. There
        will be Hell to pay if he cannot stop the disappearances of Anthony's
        money-making machines. It could mean his life. Caught in an impossible
        love with Jimmy, Violet, Anthony's favorite girl, refuses to stop
        walking the streets unless its on her terms. That means stealing for
        herself the money Jimmy collects from the other girls. But... Someone
        has his eyes on Violet. That someone wants Violet dead to satisfy the
        voices in his head.</image:caption
