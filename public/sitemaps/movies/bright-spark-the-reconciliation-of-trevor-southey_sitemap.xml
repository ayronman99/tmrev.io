        >Bright Spark: The Reconciliation of Trevor Southey follows the journey
        of artist Trevor Southey, a convert to the LDS Church from British
        Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) who dreamed of being a Latter-day Michelangelo
        and transforming Temple Square into a place where people came from
        around the world to look at the art. He immigrated to Utah in the
        mid-1960s and soon found a gang of like-minded artists at BYU. These
        artists formed a loose art colony in Alpine, Utah to pursue their
        dreams. It all came crashing down when Trevor's homosexuality was
        exposed and he was excommunicated from the Church. Thirty years later,
        as his adult daughter suffers a major health crisis, the Church steps in
        to help and he finds himself in the strange position of being
        fellowshipped and invited to rejoin the Church that rejected him.
        "Bright Spark" explores conflicts of personal freedom, religious
        belonging, and artistic expression with honesty and
        compassion.</image:caption
