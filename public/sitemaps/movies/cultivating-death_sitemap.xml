        >Cemeteries are not only places for the dead. They are also spaces in
        which the living interact with each other – and with the dead.
        “Cultivating Death” depicts the different ways in which bereaved people
        remember and commemorate their deceased family members and friends, by
        visiting and tending their graves at a Victorian cemetery in London. It
        is a common belief in the West that the bereaved have to ‘let go’ and
        ‘get over the loss’ of their deceased kin, in order to return to a
        ‘normal’ life. In contrast to these cultural norms, many survivors
        maintain strong social relationships with their dead. “Cultivating
        Death” portrays some visitors of Kensal Green Cemetery in West-London,
        as they actively sustain these continuing bonds by arranging and tending
        the graves of their deceased, talking to them and bringing them gifts.
        They thereby speak frankly about this important aspect of their mourning
        for which the cemetery constitutes a unique environment.</image:caption
