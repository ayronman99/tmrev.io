        >A philistine in the art film business, Jeremy Prokosch is a producer
        unhappy with the work of his director. Prokosch has hired Fritz Lang to
        direct an adaptation of "The Odyssey," but when it seems that the
        legendary filmmaker is making a picture destined to bomb at the box
        office, he brings in a screenwriter to energize the script. The
        professional intersects with the personal when a rift develops between
        the writer and his wife.</image:caption
