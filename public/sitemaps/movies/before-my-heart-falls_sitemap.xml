        >Sarah is part of a strange, marginal ménage à trois with her
        contemporary Louis and the older Ji-Guy, she fills her days with petty
        crime. During the day she hangs around with Louis by motorways, where
        she deceives and robs innocent people offering a lift. One day things go
        wrong: a driver dies during a robbery attempt. Sarah can’t stop thinking
        about the dead man and goes looking for the wife he left behind. In her,
        she finally finds something of the security and friendship she had
        unconsciously been seeking for so long. But her alternative family
        doesn’t just let her go.</image:caption
