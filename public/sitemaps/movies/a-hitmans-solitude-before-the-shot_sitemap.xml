        >The over-ambitious Koralnik has a dream job: he is a contract killer
        for a secret EU programme. But even eight years after his training he
        still hasn't had a single hit. Bored and frustrated, he lives according
        to the programme's strict rules - withdrawn, no social contact and
        constantly undercover. One day, the shy Rosa crashes into his car and
        life. Before he knows it, Koralnik is having dinner with her. For the
        first time, he can flee his everyday misery for an evening of company.
        But then the telephone rings. It's Koralnik's first job. With Rosa
        alongside, Koralnik sets off on a chaotic odyssey through a night in
        which nothing goes according to plan. It is only when Koralnik's target
        is revealed to be none other than one of his colleagues that the rigid
        concept by which he lives finally comes into question. He is confronted
        with the dilemma of either protecting his secret programme or drawing a
        line under his unfulfilled existence as a killer.</image:caption
