        >Tim Bergling, better know known to his millions of fans as Avicii, is
        at 24 already one of the world's best known and loved DJ:s. He plays
        sold-out venues all over the world and his name on the line up
        guarantees an almost insane audience response. But Avicii is also an
        artist with a conscience and together with his manager Ash, he is
        dedicated to fighting global hunger. This film follows Avicii during his
        Spring 2013 tour of Australia, where the profits went straight into
        their charity project "House for Hunger".</image:caption
