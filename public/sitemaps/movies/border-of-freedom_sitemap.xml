        >A village in the northwestern suburbs of Beijing has been home to young
        rock musicians and bands from all over the country since 1997. From 1999
        to 2000, there were hundreds of people and more than 30 bands. The art
        and life style of this generation of young people starts from here...Sun
        Zhiqiang surpassed the status of an ordinary documentary worker,
        shooting as a member of the underground rock scene to the most calm and
        calm appearance of the original ecology of underground music. The film
        seems to record only one thing, that is love. Since Sun Zhiqiang came to
        Beijing from Xinjiang in 1997, he never stopped observing and filming
        the lives of Beijing rock bands and marginal art youth. He has adopted
        the closest and unique perspective to silently capture the era of
        cultural turmoil. A generation of youth movements destined to change the
        direction of future culture.</image:caption
