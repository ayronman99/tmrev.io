        >How happy and proud they are those two ladies back in Oporto! Thanks to
        them, their bright nephew can study medicine in Lisbon and may already
        have become a doctor. Little do they know, not only Vasco wastes all his
        time drinking, dancing and picking up girls but he has just failed his
        final exam! And in that same day, he receives an email from the two
        aunts announcing their visit to Lisbon! Will he be able to make them
        believe he is such a good student as they think?</image:caption
