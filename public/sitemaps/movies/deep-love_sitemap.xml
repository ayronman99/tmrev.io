        >Janusz, a self-confident 60-year old, an incredibly active person and
        an accomplished diver, suffers a stroke which leaves him paralyzed.
        Rehabilitation and assistance of his partner Asia help him regain
        mobility and improve his functions. He is still struggling with speech
        and the only person who understands what he says is Asia who interprets
        him for the world. What keeps Janusz going and motivates to carry on is
        his big dream - he would like to dive again, despite major hazard for
        his health and life. His goal is to travel to beautiful but perilous
        Blue Hole in Dahab, Egypt which poses a challenge even to fit
        divers.</image:caption
