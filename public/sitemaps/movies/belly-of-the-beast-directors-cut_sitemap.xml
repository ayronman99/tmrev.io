        >Belly of the Beast Director’s Cut is a ground-breaking documentary film
        that presents the hidden history of the United States and its secret
        origins of the deep state that you’ve never seen or heard before, as
        well as decoding their present day conspiracies and the future
        prophecies to come. The adventure includes a mysterious Bible that’s
        bound in the testes of the Washington Monument, and where & why an
        underground obelisk awaits nearby; the entrance to a secret crypt in
        D.C. that’s connected to the underworld; the origins of American Lucifer
        worship linked to the deep state; and for the first time ever revealed,
        the U.S. government-owned location where The Antichrist will likely be
        resurrected on American soil! Belly of the Beast Director’s Cut
        spotlights these topics and so much more!</image:caption
