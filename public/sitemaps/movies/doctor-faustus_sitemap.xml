        >The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus, to give it its full title, by
        Christopher Marlowe, was first published in 1604, at least twelve years
        after its first performance, although the basic story of the play is
        much older. Having decided he has accumulated all he can of conventional
        knowledge, Doctor Faustus turns to magic in a quest for greater truths.
        Before long, he ends up selling his soul to the devil – the famous
        “Faustian pact” that has entered everyday language. Dr Faustus gradually
        realizes his terrible mistake. He apparently repents, but finally dies,
        the devil coming to collect his soul, and his friends the dismembered
        body.</image:caption
