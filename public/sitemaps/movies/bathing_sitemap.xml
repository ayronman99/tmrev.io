        >Bathing explores themes of contamination, cleanliness, and debility
        through performance and dance. The work draws on Staff’s research into
        the classical figure of the bather, chemical effects, drunken revelry,
        and the spiritello figures that commonly adorn European fountains. The
        performer’s continuous actions and gestures eventually lead to
        overexertion of the body. A fluid cross-contamination between substance,
        performer, and image occurs, bringing to mind the ways in which bodies
        absorb and release chemicals, hormones, and other agents—a means of
        survival for some and potentially lethal for others.</image:caption
