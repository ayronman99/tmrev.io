        >After discovering the face of their true enemy, someone who is related
        to Akito and responsible for the Geass placed upon him, W-0 attempts to
        return to their base at Castle Weisswolf. However, stranded in Warsaw
        due to a complication involving their military identification, they are
        forced to accept the help of local gypsies, allowing the squad to take
        some time to deepen their bonds. Meanwhile, Britannian advisor Julius
        Kingsley and his guard Suzaku Kururugi begin working together with the
        Knights of St. Michael in order to crush the European resistance once
        and for all, armed with the destructive power of a giant weapon known as
        the Ark Fleet.</image:caption
