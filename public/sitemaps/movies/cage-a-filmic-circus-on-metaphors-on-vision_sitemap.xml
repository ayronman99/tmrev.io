        >Imusicircus is a threefold realization of John Cage's Circus On by
        composer Douglas Cohen and film artist Lawrence Brose. The score to
        Circus On is a set of directions for creating an audio performance piece
        based on a text. First, one is instructed to "write through" a book
        (using mesostic form) to distill a text for recitation (i.e. Cage's
        Writing for the Second Time through Finnegans Wake). This mesostic text
        is then used as a guide to make a "circus of relevant sounds." The
        recited text and "circus of sounds" are combined to create a stereo
        recording (i.e. Cage's Roaratorio). This project is about translation.
        It is about the translation of a score for music into a "score" for
        video and film. It is about translating Cage's ideas and aesthetics in
        the world of sound into the visual realm.</image:caption
