        >In 1969, Kenji, an elementary school kid and his friends built a secret
        base during their summer holidays. They fantasized that they had to
        fight villains who were out to conquer the world and wrote them in the
        Book of Prophecies. Years later in 1997, Kenji becomes a convenience
        store manager and leads a regular life after giving up his dreams to
        become a rock star. His boring life is suddenly turned upside down when
        his old classmate dies mysteriously and an entire family in the
        neighbourhood disappears. At the same time, a religious cult and its
        mysterious leader, Friend emerges and a strange chain of events
        duplicating exactly the events described in the Book of Prophecies
        follow. Is this the beginning of the end of the world? Who is
        Friend?</image:caption
