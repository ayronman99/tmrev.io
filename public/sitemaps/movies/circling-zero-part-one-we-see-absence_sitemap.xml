        >Our daughter Nisi and son Aza happened to both be staying at our loft
        on Chambers Street when fundamentalist Islam struck. A friend observing
        the burning buildings from Brooklyn phoned to say, “Get out. It can fall
        on you.” But we were upstate until 9.15 when the city partially reopened
        to incoming traffic, so that my taping begins with our approach over the
        almost empty George Washington Bridge. It would be another 15 days
        before we were allowed to move back into our place. Our friend Lucia
        lent us her high-rise apartment, facing south with a dead-on view of
        smoking lower Manhattan. I kept taping, hours of street observations.
        Although I’ve given a title to this loose selection of materials it is
        not so much a work as sampling of the ongoing actuality. --Ken
