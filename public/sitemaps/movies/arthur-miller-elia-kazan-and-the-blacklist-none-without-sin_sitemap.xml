        >Director Elia Kazan and playwright Arthur Miller were once best friends
        and professional colleagues, to most that knew them then in both
        capacities as soul mates. Their politics were similar which was
        reflected in their work. Kazan was a Communist Party member for a few
        years in the mid-1930's, but Miller never officially joined the party
        ranks. Their relationship changed in the early 1950's when Kazan was
        subpoenaed to testify in front of the House Un-American Activities
        Committee where he named names of Communist Party members past and
        present.</image:caption
