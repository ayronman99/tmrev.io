        >A Tree of Palme is an interpretation of the Pinocchio tale. It concerns
        a small puppet, Palme, who was tasked by his creator to look over his
        ailing wife, Xian. After her passing, Palme is visited by a mysterious
        woman who he mistakenly believes to be Xian. Shaken out of his sadness,
        Palme accepts her request to deliver something special to a far-off
        place known as Tama. This sets Palme off on a journey to discover his
        own emotions, and what it truly means to be human.</image:caption
