        >In 2010, a musician, Watanabe Toshimi was planning to go back to his
        hometown in Fukushima to do farming. His son Toui was going to re-take
        high school entrance exam which he had failed the previous year. Both
        looked forward to starting new chapters in their lives. In 2011, Toshimi
        had to cancel his plan because of the Great East Japanese Earthquake.
        His hometown was within 20 km of the Fukushima No. 1 Nuclear Power
        Plant. To cheer up his father, Toui who passed a high school entrance
        exam promised him to go to school every day. Toshimi promised Toui to
        make him bento every day.</image:caption
