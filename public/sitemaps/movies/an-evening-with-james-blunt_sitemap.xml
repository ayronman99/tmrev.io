        >British singer/songwriter James Blunt has stormed the music charts all
        over the world with his beautifully crafted album Back to Bedlam. The
        multi-platinum selling collection of melodic ballads, including the
        modern classic You're Beautiful has propelled Blunt to stardom in an
        incredibly short space of time. On 18th November 2005, James performed
        live for an intimate audience at the BBC in London and the result was
        this wonderfully atmospheric concert, featuring a full band plus an
        eight piece string section. Filmed in HD and airing on the BBC in
        December, the show features all the hits from Back to Bedlam, including
        High, You're Beautiful, and an acoustic version of Goodbye My
        Lover.</image:caption
