        >It's the year 2080 and thanks to genius scientist Dr. Tommy, Earth is
        at peace. He created the Moon C.R.A.T.E.R. Project, the wackiest
        intergalactic sports circuit, where two opposing Robot armies battle it
        out to settle Earth's disputes using the deadliest weapon known: water!
        Bolts and Blip, Central City's misfits, are accidently recruited as
        members of the Lunar Leagues last placed team - The Thunderbolts! They
        find themselves catapulted into a series of hilarious lunar battles and
        soon discover that all is not what it seems. In the next instalment of
        BOLTS &amp; BLIP, the Thunderbolts fall under the spell of a mysterious
        "Black Box", a strange invader crash lands on the moon and threatens to
        destroy Lunar City and Saedee finds herself replaced as team captain, by
        a mysterious prototype "Saedee-34".</image:caption
