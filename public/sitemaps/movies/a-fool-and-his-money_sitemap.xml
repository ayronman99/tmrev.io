        >New York advertising executive Morris Codman seems to have it all -
        lots of talent and a beautiful girlfriend, Debbie. When he loses his job
        he decides to use his advertising expertise to create, package and
        market a shady product that will make him millions. Debbie tries to
        convince him that money isn't everything and she loves him just the way
        he is. Morris' bizarre antics in promoting his product surprisingly lead
        to a fortune, but can love survive his quest for the almighty
        dollar?</image:caption
