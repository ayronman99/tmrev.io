        >Even the dead need policemen. Meet the Border Patrol, which is to
        ensure that the law is enforced in the territory of the dead. These hard
        supernatural guards are responsible for sinners to face their destiny
        and that good are the creator. To Numan, a character who makes the laws
        are enforced in the gloomy abyss between the two worlds, the present
        case appears to be the most tremendous of his career, both his past life
        in New York, as now become the Patrullero Spooky Frontera . When chasing
        a serial murderer, Dr. Helms, Numan is forced to break the rules of
        Purgatory and ask for help to the police in Miami Chavez, a mortal. The
        union of these incredible allies soon becomes clear that Helms, a
        strange supernatural being generic, has the power to open the door to
