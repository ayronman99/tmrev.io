        >Presented by the Atlanta Ballet in 2018. Long ago, a handsome young
        Prince lived in a magnificent castle. Though he enjoyed a life of
        riches, he was rude and unkind to his subjects. One fateful day, an old
        beggar woman approached him. Because his heart was cold, the selfish
        Prince turned the poor woman away. To the Prince’s surprise, the woman
        then transformed into a beautiful enchantress. She put a curse on the
        Prince for his ugly behavior, turning him into an equally ugly beast.
        The Enchantress’ curse could only be broken by one thing – a true love’s
        kiss.</image:caption
