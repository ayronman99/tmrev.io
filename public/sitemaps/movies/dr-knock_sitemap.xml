        >Saint-Maurice, an ordinary peaceful village, lived healthily so much so
        that the local doctor's practice was scant. But that was before Dr.
        Parpalaid retired and was replaced by a charlatan by the name of Knock.
        A real genius this one, for he soon managed to persuade everyone that
        they were ill. And not only didn't they resent him but they even loved
        their physician, who made a fortune and brought prosperity to the
        village by turning it into a big hospital.</image:caption
