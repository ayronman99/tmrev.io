        >In his third hour special, comic and podcaster Dan Cummins presents
        some of his most outrageous material to date. Dan mocks those who
        believe in the lizard illuminati, a flat earth, the notion that you can
        sell your soul to Satan, and more. Dan even makes fun of himself for
        once having sex with a banana peel in a grocery store bathroom -
        nothing's too weird or dark. Dan jokes about his kids, his ongoing
        hatred of strangers, and even offers to improve the world by killing a
        lot of people. Enjoy!</image:caption
