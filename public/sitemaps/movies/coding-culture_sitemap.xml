        >The Indian software outsourcing industry has emerged as a key node of
        the global economy. The series of ethnographic films, Coding Culture,
        explores the cultures of outsourced work and the moulding of a new
        workforce to cater to this global high-tech services industry. Each of
        the three films focuses on a single company, representing one of the
        major types of software company found in Bangalore: a medium-sized
        Indian-owned company software services company (Mphasis: The 'M' Way);
        the offshore software development centre of a U.S.-based IT company (Sun
        Microsystems: Fun@Sun); and a small 'cross-border' startup company that
        produces its own software products and markets them to global customers
        (July Systems: July Boys). All three companies are engaged in the
        production of software products or services for markets outside of
        India, but the nature of their work and their position in the global
        economy differ, producing significant variations in their cultures of
        work.</image:caption
