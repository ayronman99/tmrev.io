        >Bethany's Story is a documentary about the healing power of food.
        Bethany lived the life of a normal teenage girl before she became
        paralyzed by a bad reaction to medication and was told she would never
        walk again. The documentary covers her amazing recovery as she makes
        dramatic lifestyle changes. Featuring interviews with leading nutrition
        experts and medical doctors, Bethany's Story is a testament to the power
        of food as medicine, as well as the courage of a young girl to face an
        immense obstacle, overcome it and in the process help inspire all of us
        to make forward progress in our lives, whatever our challenge may
        be.</image:caption
