        >Echo of the Mountain takes a look at the life and work of Santos de la
        Torre, a great Huichol artist who, like his people, lives in oblivion.
        Despite having made a great mural for the metro station Palais Royal –
        Musée du Louvre, Santos lives isolated and ignored in his country. This
        documentary follows his pilgrimage to Wirikuta, where he asks gods for
        permission to make a new mural; his journey across 385 miles of the
        Peyote Route, and Santos's creative process during the making of a new
        mural which aims to illustrate the history, mythology and religious
        traditions of the Huichol people.</image:caption
