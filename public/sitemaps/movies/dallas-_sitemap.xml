        >Rusty (Shawn Hatosy) has been bailed out of bad situations more than
        once by his understanding but distraught mother, Mary (Kelly Lynch).
        When Mary starts dating a psychologist, Bob (Jeff Goldblum), Rusty
        connects with the man and begins talking to him about his problems. As
        Rusty benefits from the therapy sessions, his best friend, Dallas (Scott
        Caan), still very involved in illegal and dangerous activities, takes
        issue with Rusty going straight and cleaning up his life.</image:caption
