        >San Francisco's Richmond District. A widow welcomes the Chinese New
        Year. 62 years old, she wants to make a trip to China to pay last
        respects to her ancestors. A fortune teller has told her this is the
        year she'll die, and a daughter, Geraldine, remains unmarried.
        Geraldine's boyfriend lives in Los Angeles and she's not sure she's
        ready for marriage, nor does she want to leave her mother alone in her
        declining years. Mrs. Tan's cheerful brother-in-law, Uncle Tam, tries to
        help out.</image:caption
