        >A comedic short about the rough relationship between a woman and her
        personified period. Chloe is your average menstruating female who
        believes that she has the worst period ever. Big Red, her period, who
        takes the form of a childlike, seemingly harmless, yet completely
        dangerous woman, always shows up when she’s least expected. This time
        she’s early and she happens to be interrupting an extremely intimate
        moment between Chloe and her new-ish boyfriend, Adam. This causes their
        romantic night to end and a week of tough love with Big Red to begin.
        But something happens during the course of this week that changes the
        way Chloe sees her period forever.</image:caption
