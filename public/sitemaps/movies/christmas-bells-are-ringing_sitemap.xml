        >Samantha, a freelance photographer, is returning to Cape Cod for the
        first time since the death of her mother years earlier. She’s going to
        celebrate her father’s Christmas Eve wedding but is anxious to revisit
        past memories. On a deadline for a big Christmas spread that could
        ignite her career, she enlists the help of her childhood friend, Mike,
        to show her around. In the time she spends in Cape Cod, she realizes
        that Christmas is wherever your family is.</image:caption
