        >In this feature-length special to mark her last adventure, Jodie
        Whittaker’s Thirteenth Doctor must fight for her very existence against
        her deadliest enemies: the Daleks, the Cybermen and her arch-nemesis,
        the Master. Who is attacking a speeding bullet train on the edges of a
        distant galaxy? Why are seismologists going missing from 21st-century
        Earth? Who is defacing some of history’s most iconic paintings? Why is a
        Dalek trying to make contact with the Doctor? And just what hold does
        the mesmeric Rasputin have over Tsar Nicholas II in 1916 Russia? The
        Doctor faces multiple threats - and a battle to the
        death.</image:caption
