        >This heart warming film is about a dog named Cooper who is the lone
        survivor of a terrible car accident. Jake, a family patriarch, loses his
        wife and children in the accident. Not being a dog person, Jake is angry
        and resentful toward the dog for even surviving. However, eventually
        Jake bonds with Cooper, and this bond ends up being the one thing that
        gets him out of bed in the morning, the one thing that helps him to go
        on living after such a tragic loss.</image:caption
