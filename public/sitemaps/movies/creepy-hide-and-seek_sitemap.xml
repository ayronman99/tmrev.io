        >when rumors about students who played at hitori Kakurenbo (sort of hide
        and seek alone with a ghost) propagate in high school, Shiori can no
        longer join his older brother Motoya. On his way to the apartment he is
        supposed to live, she found an empty room. But an internet forum
        unearthed on the computer of her brother leads her to believe that the
        disappearance of the latter may well be linked to this sordid game of
        hide and seek. Despite attempts by her boyfriend Noboru and his best to
        reassure her friend Yuko, Shiori is beginning to be convinced that
        something he wants her too and tries to track down. It will then turn to
        Shiraishi, a former classmate of her brother, trying to understand what
        is happening and return Motoya.</image:caption
