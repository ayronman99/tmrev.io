        >Nicolas Lanson, a young stockbroker, lives a fast life of money and
        luxury until the day his high-risk initiatives cause the fall of the
        bank. He flees with a price on his head. On the run, Nicolas meets
        Charlotte, pregnant for a man who doesn't want her. Although Nicolas
        isn't her type, Charlotte seduces him once she discovers his identity.
        Little does Nicolas know, Charlotte is not leading them to see her
        brother, but an older lover who just happens to be a cop.</image:caption
