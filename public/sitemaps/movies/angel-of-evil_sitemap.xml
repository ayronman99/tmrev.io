        >Set in Italy in the 1970s, VALLANZASCA is the true story of the Italian
        underworld’s most infamous outlaw. A criminal by age 9, Renato
        Vallanzasca grew up to become the country’s most notorious mobster
        before the age of 27. Vallanzasca and his gang wrested control of the
        Milan underworld with a string of high profile robberies, kidnappings
        and murders. In the process, he captivated the public and earned the
        nickname ‘il bel Renè’ – for his devilish charm and handsome face.
        Arrested multiple times, his daring escapes from prison enraged the
        government, angered his rivals and fed his legend.</image:caption
