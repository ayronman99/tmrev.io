        >All We Sheep Have Gone Astray is an experimental film that shows the
        internal struggles of a person who is frustrated with the function and
        structure of the world. The film sets a surreal portrayal of the
        person's mind as he talks to himself about his personal critique on
        humanity, individualism, and the idea of free will. The cinematic
        elements within the film guide the protagonist through his quest as he
        strives to retain his deepest thoughts from the outside
        world.</image:caption
