        >Some time ago three total strangers participated in a cheesecake
        commercial. A mother, a father and a son were simply having tea at a
        dinner table, but for the boy from a dysfunctional family the shot where
        they were eating a cake together became an obsession; he dreams about
        another “family” gathering at the same table. Alyosha does not care that
        his “mom”, Natalia, has been married for a long time, and that his
        “dad”, Mikhail, has a girlfriend.</image:caption
