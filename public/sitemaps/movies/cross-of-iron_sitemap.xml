        >It is 1943, and the German army—ravaged and demoralised—is hastily
        retreating from the Russian front. In the midst of the madness, conflict
        brews between the aristocratic yet ultimately pusillanimous Captain
        Stransky and the courageous Corporal Steiner. Stransky is the only man
        who believes that the Third Reich is still vastly superior to the
        Russian army. However, within his pompous persona lies a quivering
        coward who longs for the Iron Cross so that he can return to Berlin a
        hero. Steiner, on the other hand is cynical, defiantly non-conformist
        and more concerned with the safety of his own men rather than the horde
        of military decorations offered to him by his superiors.</image:caption
