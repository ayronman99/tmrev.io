        >BETTER THAN SOMETHING is an exciting and intimate portrait of
        Memphis-based punk musician Jay Reatard, who toured the world and
        released dozens of records over the course of a 15 year career that
        began in his mid-teens. Original and never-before-seen footage documents
        his self-made journey to iconic garage rock star, with colleagues,
        friends, and family speaking candidly about Jay's vibrant and
        complicated life. Jay Reatard himself - filmed just nine months before
        his untimely death at the age of twenty-nine - shares his experiences
        both on and off stage, with all the humor, savvy, and pathos one can
        expect from such a prolific and vital artist.</image:caption
