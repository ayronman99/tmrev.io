        >An employee in an assurance company threatens to commit suicide when
        management announces a massive layoff, the company uses this threat to
        its own advantage by turning the incident into an advertising campaign.
        With the success of the campaign, however, he is no longer a desperate
        man pointing a gun to his head, but a potential leader who wishes to
        take advantage of his failed suicide.</image:caption
