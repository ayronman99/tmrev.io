        >Jancsó’s farce, similar to the previous ones, is about our time and
        about death. Pepe marries into a family of mafiosi, with the
        father-in-law rolling in money. In a joint venture they establish the
        first Hungarian Prison Limited company, where there is a menu, the
        prisoners are residents, and they furnish the place of execution for
        those volunteering to execute themselves. It turns out that the first
        voluntary hanging should be demonstrated on Pepe. In 180 AD Emperor
        Marcus Aurelius is dying in Vindobona, being fed with blades of hay by
        uncle Miki himself, and his son Kornél Mundruczó. Kapa provides for
        communication: he insists on telling lies, lies and again lies.
        Furthermore, there are several to die and to revive, to win and to lose,
        and Melancholy Béla is still alive.</image:caption
