        >After ending his long-term relationship, Antonio is sure that he can
        quickly get over Sofia. But nothing is as simple as it seems. And
        realizing the impossibility of controlling his own feelings, he begins
        to boycott them, using all sorts of contemporary palliative measures to
        free himself from the memories of his ex: cognitive psychoanalysis,
        prescription drugs, Tinder, among others. Ergo, Antonio will go through
        several tragicomic situations.</image:caption
