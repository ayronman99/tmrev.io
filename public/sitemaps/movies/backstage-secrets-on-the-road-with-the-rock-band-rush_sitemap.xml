        >Go behind the scenes to get a backstage look at what it takes to
        present the legendary band Rush during the 2008 Snakes & Arrows Concert
        Tour. It may appear to be one of the most exciting and glamorous jobs in
        the world â€“ but being a roadie with a top-rated world-famous rock and
        roll band can be a grueling marathon of 18 hour work days, on an easy
        day. A bad is actually a couple of days, 40 hours spent hauling gear,
        assembling huge stacks of speakers, lifting them a hundred feet in the
        air, tuning instruments for demanding musicians and being cut off from
        every lover, friend and relative you have. This series takes you to the
        show you never see when you take your seat for a concert by the
        legendary band Rush. All the backstage secrets are
        revealed.</image:caption
