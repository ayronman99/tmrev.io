        >Adult Camp is a comedy about the bumpy road to personal growth. A group
        of men and women, strangers to each other, choose to spend a different
        kind of summer holiday week by traveling to the beautiful Turku
        archipelago to participate in an inviting, upgraded version of an adult
        camp. When they discover that the galloping horses from the camp's sales
        video are just symbols of a free mind, and the guru of the camp takes
        off to witness his dog in labour, the participants are forced to examine
        themselves and each other to find the necessary elements for growth.
        Perhaps the camp doesn't fulfill its promise of the "most wonderful week
        of your life", but one thing's for sure - no one returns home the
        same.</image:caption
