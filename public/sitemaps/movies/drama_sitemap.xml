        >The film starts in a village in Mandya where two youngsters Venkatesha
        and Sathish, who have failed their pre-degree courses seven times,
        create problems. Nandini, an ultra-modern girl comes to the village and
        attracts Venkatesha, who is prepared to do anything for pleasing the
        girl. Both Venkatesha and Sathish follow Nandini to Mysore, where she is
        pursuing studies. A strict principal of the college humiliates Nandini
        when she crosses the limits. Meanwhile, the principal gets murdered and
        a police officer suspects Venkatesha and Nandini to be behind this
        murder. There is a lot of confusion when it is revealed that Nandini is
        the daughter of a Dubai-based don, who is trying to kill a
        Mangalore-based don. What happens in the end is revealed in an
        interesting climax.</image:caption
