        >Inspired by Dave Attell's popular Comedy Central series, this concert
        movie deposits him and three fellow comics, including the wildly popular
        Dane Cook, at the House of Blues in Las Vegas to deliver some raucous
        and frequently funny material before an appreciative crowd. Those who
        know Attell's misanthropic stage persona from his series won't be
        disappointed by his material here, though he functions mainly as host
        for his three co-headliners. Rouse takes the easy route with jokes aimed
        straight for the heart of the rowdy audience (sex, booze, drugs),
        Giraldo mixes gags based around fatherhood with some political humor,
        while Cook, whose status has blossomed to near-superstardom thanks to
        tours like this, is broad and fairly foul-mouthed, but gives an
        engagingly manic performance, which is well received by the heavily
        lubricated twenty-something crowd.</image:caption
