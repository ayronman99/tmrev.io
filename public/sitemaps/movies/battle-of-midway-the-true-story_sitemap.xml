        >It's June 1942 and the world's fate is about to be decided by a handful
        of pilots and their untested aircraft. Experience an inside look at the
        Battle of Midway, captured through rarely seen battle footage and
        firsthand accounts from its hero dive-bombing pilot, "Dusty" Kleiss.
        This is an hour-by-hour recount of one of the most pivotal conflicts of
        the 20th century. Take a closer look at how this desperately needed
        victory came about through the design of U.S. airplanes, the skill of
        the pilots, the element of surprise, and a stroke of
        luck.</image:caption
