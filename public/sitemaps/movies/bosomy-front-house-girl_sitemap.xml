        >Na-yeong who has always been a friend of the innocent and friendly
        Hoon-i knows that he really likes the girl living in the house in front
        named Da-hee, and tries to connect them somehow. However, Da-hee doubts
        the relationship between Hoon-i and Na-yeong so he treats Hoon-i more
        and more coldly, and she opens her heart to her colleague, Min-soo,
        instead. But Min-soo who's a senior in the company only thinks of Da-hee
        as one of his many girls, and Na-yeong is aware of this fact. She tries
        to tell Hoon-i and Da-hee about this... The story of two men and women
        wandering between love and friendship is just beginning.</image:caption
