        >Bill and Ted are high school buddies starting a band. They are also
        about to fail their history class—which means Ted would be sent to
        military school—but receive help from Rufus, a traveller from a future
        where their band is the foundation for a perfect society. With the use
        of Rufus' time machine, Bill and Ted travel to various points in
        history, returning with important figures to help them complete their
        final history presentation.</image:caption
