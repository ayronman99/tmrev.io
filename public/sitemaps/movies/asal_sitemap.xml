        >The film revolves around the feud between the three brothers over
        property; two brothers, from their father's first wife on one side with
        their avarice for all the wealth with the righteous third, from his
        father's second marriage, trying to stop the family from breaking down.
        The feud that exists as an undercurrent in the presence of their father
        and turns ugly and personal after he passes away. It grows bigger with
        the two brothers joining in to elbow out the third but he graciously
        steps aside, only wanting to keep cordial relations. But, the two
        brothers are just not able to handle the huge wealth and the
        responsibility that it brings. Their wealth attracts trouble and it is
        up to the third to come back and save his brothers, against others who
        strive for the wealth while the crux of the plot revolves around if
        wealth does disintegrate the family.</image:caption
