        >Josh wakes each day to a series of Hells. Between uncaring parents and
        bullying at school he has little to live for. After a brutal event and
        ensuing humiliation of an online video, Josh and his friends decide to
        take revenge by staging a massacre at the homecoming dance. Searching
        for weapons, they find a man who perpetuates a far more murderous
        darkness than even their plot might suggest. Trapped in his lair, and
        finding a kidnapped girl from the opposite clique, the boys learn a lot
        about each other’s character and their own. Even if Josh can rescue the
        captive cheerleader, he must still lead them both out in time to stop
        his friend from completing the pact to massacre their school. An
        American Terror is an explosive and surprising modern day horror
        mash-up. Totally and relentlessly disquieting – great atmosphere and
        sound and perfectly gruesome.</image:caption
