        >Fed up with being pushed around, a group of gay and trans teens of
        color form a gang and fight back on the brutal streets of Washington
        D.C. They call their gang ‘Check it’ and this group of one-time victims
        of bullying, rape and abuse have turned the tables on anyone trying to
        hurt them. The group formed to provide its members safety in numbers and
        let people know that if they jump a queer kid in D.C., they may get
        beaten into a coma. This raw and intimate portrait follows three
        childhood friends as they struggle to survive and claw their way out of
        gang life through an unlikely avenue: fashion.</image:caption
