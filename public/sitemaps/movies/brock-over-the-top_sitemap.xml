        >Brock: Over the Top is a feature length documentary that not only
        chronicles the extraordinary life of Australia’s greatest racing car
        driver, Peter Brock, but peels away the surface to reveal the profoundly
        human story behind the legend. This film is a cinematic, thrilling yet
        intimately personal portrait of a life lived on the racing track and in
        the public eye. Using a treasure trove of rare archival material coupled
        with candid interviews with the key characters in Peter Brock’s life
        including his family, his partners, and closest colleagues, this film
        tells the epic story of Brock's early obsession with cars, his hard won
        ascension to the top, his incredible record-breaking victories at
        Bathurst, his various professional and personal controversies, and his
        ultimate, tragic death on the race track.</image:caption
