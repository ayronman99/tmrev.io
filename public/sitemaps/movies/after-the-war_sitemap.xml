        >Bologna, 2002. Amidst protests against the labor reform, the
        assassination of a lawyer opens old wounds between Italy and France.
        Former far-left terrorist Marco, convicted of murder during the Years of
        Lead and living in Paris since then thanks to the Mitterrand Doctrine,
        is suspected of being its instigator. When the Italian government asks
        for extradition, Marco goes into hiding with his daughter Viola,
        precipitating also the life of his family back in Italy.</image:caption
