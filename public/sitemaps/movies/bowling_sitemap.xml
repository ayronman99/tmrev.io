        >The story takes place in Carhaix, in the heart of Brittany. A small
        hospital, with a calm maternity clinic, where few births take place.
        Mathilde, a mid-wife, Firmine, a pediatric nurse, and Louise, the owner
        of the Carhaix bowling alley, are all friends and lead a happy
        existence. Catherine, director of the establishment's Human Resources,
        is sent to restructure the hospital and, most importantly, to eventually
        shut down the maternity clinic, which is losing money. Four women whose
        age, personalities, and origins are different, but who will form a
        quartet overflowing with humanity and humor as they join forces to save
        the clinic. Life, love, friendship, Brittany and...
        bowling.</image:caption
