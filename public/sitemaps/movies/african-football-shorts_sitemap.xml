        >Meet Dominic Pascoe, a 10 year old boy living in Cape Town, South
        Africa. Dominic lives in an area of Cape Town known as "The Kraal".The
        Kraal is a desperately poor informal settlement known as a centre of
        crime situated in the Bo-Kaap between Cape Town's brand new R4.5 billion
        World Cup stadium and the city centre. Home to about 150 people,
        including a number of children, it is a dirt-poor squatter camp out of
        sight of the tourists who flock to the Mother City to enjoy its world
        class attractions.</image:caption
