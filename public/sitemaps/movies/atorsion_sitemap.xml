        >(A) Torsion is a 2002 Bosnian short film directed by Stefan
        Arsenijevic. A singing group, trying to escape war-torn Sarajevo, has to
        wait for a tunnel to clear. While they wait, a cow has difficulty giving
        birth because of the "torsion" affecting its calf (i.e., it's in a
        twisted position inside). Fortunately, one of the choir members has some
        veterinary training, and with help from the chorus to drown out the
        sounds of war, the cow gives birth. The film was nominated for an Oscar
        for Best Live Action Short Film.</image:caption
