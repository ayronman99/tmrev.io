        >The film tells the story of the intimate and unprecedented encounter
        between the photojournalists of the Magnum Agency and the world of
        cinema. The confrontation of two seemingly opposite worlds â€“ fiction and
        reality. For 70 years their paths crossed: a family of photographers,
        amongst them the biggest names in photography, and a family of actors
        and filmmakers who helped write the history of cinema, from John Huston
        to Marilyn Monroe to Orson Welles, Kate Winslet and Sean
        Penn.</image:caption
