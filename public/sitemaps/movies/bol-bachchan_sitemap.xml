        >Abbas Ali (Abhishek Bachchan) lives in Chandni Chowk, New Delhi with
        his sister Sania (Asin Thottumkal). They are legally fighting for an
        ancestral propertyâ€” land case. But the odds turn against them and they
        lose. Their well wisher, Shastri Chacha, advises and convinces them to
        migrate to his village Ranakpur where he assures Abbas that he will get
        him a job at his owner's place. The owner being none other than the
        powerful Prithviraj Raghuvanshi (Ajay Devgn). Abbas enters Ranakpur
        village and while saving a child trapped inside a temple, he breaks open
        the lock of an ancestral temple but fate plays an important twist in
        Abbas' life as the whole village including Prithviraj's step-brother
        Vikrant opposes Abbas' actions but Prithviraj arrives and handles the
        situation.</image:caption
