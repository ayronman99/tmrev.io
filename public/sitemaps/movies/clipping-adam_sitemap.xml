        >Despite what he says, Adam is not "fine". The summer before freshman
        year should be a time full of possibilities, but Adam struggles with
        family tragedy, everyday teenage growing pains, and the very real threat
        of high school hazing. Fortunately, Adam finds allies (some likely, some
        unlikely) who help him repair his heartache as well as his ailing
        relationship with his father. Set in a small, Southern California beach
        town, Adam discovers the inner strength one can find with the support of
        a community. His story is proof of the notion that with the help of
        family and friends, you can always find your way back
        home.</image:caption
