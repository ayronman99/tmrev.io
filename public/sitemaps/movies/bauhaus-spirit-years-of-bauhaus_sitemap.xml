        >Founded in 1919 by Walter Gropius, Bauhaus was supposed to unite
        sculpture, painting, design and architecture into a single combined
        constructive discipline. It is a synthesis of liberated imagination and
        stringent structure; cross-medial concepts that embellish and enrich our
        existence, illumination and clarity, order and playfulness. But Bauhaus
        was never just an artistic experiment. Confronted with the social
        conditions of that particular time, as well as the experience of WWI,
        the movement concerned itself with the political and social connotations
        of design from the very outset. Hence, Bauhaus history is not just the
        history of art, but also the history of an era that stretches from the
        early 20th century to the modern day.</image:caption
