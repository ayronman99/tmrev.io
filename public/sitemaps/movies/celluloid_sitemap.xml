        >A psychological drama/thriller, that takes you into the heart of
        dysfunctional family life. Dawn's struggle with her past is played out
        not only upon the couch during regression therapy but also within the
        family home. With the help of Josh's method of escapism; a penchant for
        viewing life through a lens, we learn from his footage the extent and
        impact this situation has had over the years. Vulnerable and unable to
        articulate their worries, teenagers Josh &amp; Nicola struggle with
        their mum's more recent bout of outbursts and her increasing
        instability. They forge relationships outside of the family unit; to
        escape in Nicola's case and for support whilst they try to maintain some
        sense of a 'normal' existence. As relationships at home become frayed,
        suspicions about Dawn's therapist's integrity &amp; motivations arise.
        Dawn is sectioned and social services are informed.</image:caption
