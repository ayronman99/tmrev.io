        >Peter and Nina, both around 40 and parents of two children, decide to
        part as harmoniously as possible. However, Peter only moves to the
        summerhouse. The firm decision of Peter and Nina: "We want to remain
        friends and continue to care for our children as well as possible." This
        is not just lip service but really the intention of both parents. After
        all, you're grown up. Already at the very beginning of her new life,
        however, it can be felt that Peter does not take this separation as
        seriously as Nina, who is clearly the driving force behind Peter's
        departure.</image:caption
