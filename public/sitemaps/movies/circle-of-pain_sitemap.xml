        >Following an in-ring accident, Dalton Hunt retired from the world of
        mixed martial arts at the top of his game. Unable to outrun his guilt,
        he lost his family, his title, and his way. But when a crooked promoter
        lures him back into a fight against the current undefeated champ,
        Patrick "The Brick" Wahle, Dalton must enlist the aid of an enigmatic
        trainer to turn him back into a warrior so he can stand tall and do
        battle once again.</image:caption
