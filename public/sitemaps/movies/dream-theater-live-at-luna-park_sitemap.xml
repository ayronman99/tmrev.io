        >Live at Luna Park is a live album/video by American progressive metal
        band Dream Theater, released on November 5, 2013 through Eagle Rock
        Entertainment. The concert film was produced by Over The Edge
        Productions and directed by Mike Leonard. The album is available on
        Blu-ray, a two DVD set and Blu-ray plus two DVD combo with three CDs and
        a Deluxe Edition with a 40-page book. The album will also be available
        on iTunes. The album was recorded over two nights at Luna Park Stadium
        in Buenos Aires. The DVD-Blu-ray will also feature a documentary as well
        as Behind The Scenes-footage. It is also the first Dream Theater live
        recording to feature drummer Mike Mangini, following Mike Portnoy's
        departure in 2010. Dream Theater are rocks supreme virtuosos with many
        awards to their name and here in concert they bring all the power and
        drama of their music to life with breathtaking performances of classic
        tracks from across their career.</image:caption
