        >The main character of the film Sergey Dobrolyubov is a news anchor of a
        music channel. Because of his conservatism he looks strange among his
        progressive colleagues. And his skeptical and negative attitude to all
        things new and unusual is a constant target of their mockery. He is
        definitely not a star of the channel. Sergey and his wife want to have a
        baby but have no success. Only a miracle can help them but Sergey does
        not believe in miracles till one particular moment. He makes a wish to
        have a baby, and a miracle happens - he gets pregnant! Now Sergey must
        prove to everyone - dreams can come true. But his friend Zhora sees a
        practical side of this situation. He suggests Sergey to use his
        pregnancy to gain money and glory by launching a new TV show. The Show
        Pregnant becomes very popular, and the protagonist Sergey Dobrolyubov is
        a star of it. But it is not easy to be a man in the family way and a TV
        star.</image:caption
