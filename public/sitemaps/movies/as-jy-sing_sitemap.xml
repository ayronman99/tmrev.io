        >Several pupils from Hoër Volkskool Heidelberg are on their way to
        compete in a singing competition; but the majority of the school,
        including the principal, is not supportive. In this school, sport far
        outweighs culture. However, this does not stop the singers from the
        group to follow their passion. The principal wants to sabotage the
        group’s tour and sends one of the school’s teachers to distract the
        music teacher. They eventually arrive at a camp where they are treated
        as if they were in the army. This is all the principal’s
        doing.</image:caption
