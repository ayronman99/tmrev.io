        >A South American outlaw who reigns in the underworld and is brutal and
        cool, and the archipelago who is tumultuous due to the criminal method
        away from the Japanese. The scariest outlaw he was in South America
        destroying all morale! Riki Takeuchi returned from Colombia, South
        America a few years ago. He currently has a used car dealership. But
        that's the front face. The back face was the head of a trafficking
        organization sent by a Colombian drug cartel. the only one who does not
        have an organization and has entered the market where China's shabs have
        an overwhelming share. One day, a conflict broke out with the Yang
        brothers of the Chinese mafia (Tomoyuki Mashiko, Kazuhiro Mashiko) due
        to a small problem. A series of monstrous crimes that flood the city at
        the same time. And Nagasaka (Kenichi Endo), a former bad friend, who
        tries to steal both cocaine and shab routes. A large-scale conflict
        between Chinese and Colombian organizations that shakes society from
        scratch.</image:caption
