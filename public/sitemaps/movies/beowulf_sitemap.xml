        >Since 1990, Benjamin Bagby has been performing the great epic Beowulf
        at major festivals and venues around the world. This remarkable
        performance is presented on DVD, beautifully filmed by the award-winning
        Swedish director Stellan Olsson. While Beowulf has come down to us
        through literature as a written poem, the epic's pre-literate medieval
        audience would have known it through the performance of a scop, a bardic
        storyteller, as Bagby presents himself here. In this one-man tour de
        force, Bagby accompanies himself on an Anglo-Saxon harp. Using the
        entire range of his voice, he delivers this gripping tale in Old
        English, as it could have been experienced more than one thousand years
        ago. This performance speaks to the lovers of Beowulf and the oral epic,
        early music enthusiasts, Tolkien fans, medievalists, and anyone
        searching for virtuoso storytelling or a glimpse into the fascinating
        beginnings of the English language.</image:caption
