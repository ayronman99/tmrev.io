        >In 1987, frustrated junior high student Takashi hates his uncool father
        hanging around their suburban home all the time, and is pestered by the
        area’s wannabe gangsters. But he’s interested in the girl next door, the
        bounteously-breasted Megumi. One day, Takashi hears a rumor that porn
        actress Kyoko Yokushimaru is coming to town for an autograph session at
        the only video store in town where Takashi and his judo friends always
        hang out. Their ridiculous but serious adventure begins. What will
        Takashi find after all the surprises and chaos? Recalling youth classics
        like Stand By Me, this is the debut feature of Shin Adachi, Japan
        Academy Prize-winning screenwriter of 100 Yen Love.</image:caption
