        >Jay van Niekerk is a young, attractive and career driven comic book
        illustrator. Although he is advancing in almost every aspect of his
        personal and professional life, his one true desire seems to be the one
        furthest from reach. This has brought him to a crossroad in his life.
        Does he give up and keep fully focused on his career or does he finally
        open his heart to fulfill his deep longing for love and set out to meet
        the woman of his dreams? He wants someone funny, someone bright, who
        will appreciate his love of comics and embrace his eccentric
        lifestyle.</image:caption
