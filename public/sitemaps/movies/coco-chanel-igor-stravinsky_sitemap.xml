        >Paris 1913. Coco Chanel is infatuated with the rich and handsome Boy
        Capel, but she is also compelled by her work. Igor Stravinsky's The Rite
        of Spring is about to be performed. The revolutionary dissonances of
        Igor's work parallel Coco's radical ideas. She wants to democratize
        women's fashion; he wants to redefine musical taste. Coco attends the
        scandalous first performance of The Rite in a chic white dress. The
        music and ballet are criticized as too modern, too foreign. Coco is
        moved but Igor is inconsolable.</image:caption
