        >Dance Together follows two teen girls brought together by a passionate
        need to express themselves. Holly, an injured dancer, and Alex, a shy
        girl who is Deaf, have a chance meeting that sparks a creative
        partnership. Alex introduces Holly to American Sign Language poetry and
        helps her gain the confidence to stand up to her bullies, while Holly
        helps Alex add a dancer's flair to her poetry routine that just might
        put her group over the top. Dance Together features original and
