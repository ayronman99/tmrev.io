        >Mark Thomas stages a farewell performance in order to retire his drag
        queen alter-ego Babs Johnson at Legends Night Club and Bar in Raleigh,
        North Carolina. His shows have been censored over the past five years in
        previous productions, and this occasion is no different. Director Nick
        Karner follows Thomas and his crew of friends, misfits, weirdos, and the
        Cavalcade of Perversion over a tumultuous three-day period. The
        performance is cancelled twice, the promotional flyers are rejected and
        torn down, and most of the props and costumes for the performance are
        created on the day of the show. While attempting to pull the show
        together, Thomas realizes that his freedom of speech and expression has
        been challenged. The films becomes an allegory about censorship, and he
        continues to argue with the owners of the night club all the way to the
        opening night, where the show is a triumphant success and Babs Johnson's
        swan song.</image:caption
