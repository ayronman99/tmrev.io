        >In London's contemporary art world, everyone has a hustle. Art Spindle
        runs a high-end gallery: he hopes to flip a Mondrian for millions. One
        of his assistants, Beth, is sleeping with Art's most acquisitive client,
        Bob Macclestone. Beth wants Bob to set her up in her own gallery, so she
        helps him go behind Art's back for the Mondrian. Bob's wife, Jean, sets
        her eye on a young conceptual artist, Jo, who lusts after Art's newest
        assistant, Paige. Meanwhile, self-absorbed videographer Elaine is
        chewing her way through friends and lovers looking to make it: if she'll
        throw Dewey, her agent, under the bus, Beth may give her a show. And the
        Mondrian? No honor among thieves.</image:caption
