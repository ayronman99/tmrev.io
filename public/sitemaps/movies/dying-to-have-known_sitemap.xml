        >A documentary filmmaker goes on a 52-day journey to find evidence
        supporting the effectiveness of the Gerson Therapy -- a long-suppressed
        natural cancer cure. His travels take him from Alaska to Mexico with
        stops in San Diego, New York, Japan, Holland and Spain. In the end, he
        presents the testimonies of patients, scientists, surgeons and
        nutritionists who testify to the therapy s efficacy in curing cancer and
        other degenerative diseases, and presents the hard scientific proof to
        back up their claims. Testimonies include: a Japanese medical school
        professor who cured himself of liver cancer over 15 years ago, a
        lymphoma patient who was diagnosed as terminal over 50 years ago as well
        as from noted critics of this world-renowned healing method who dismiss
        it out of hand as pure quackery. So the question that remains is, Why is
        this powerful curative therapy still suppressed, more than 75 years
        after it was clearly proven to cure degenerative
        diseases?</image:caption
