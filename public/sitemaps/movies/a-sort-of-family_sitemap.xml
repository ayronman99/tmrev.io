        >What limits does Malena cross to get what she wants most? Malena is a
        38 year old middle class doctor from Buenos Aires. One afternoon she
        receives the call from Doctor Costas, who informs her that she must
        travel immediately to the north of the country: the baby she was waiting
        for is about to be born. Unexpectedly Malena decides to embark on an
        uncertain journey, full of crossroads, facing all kinds of legal and
        moral obstacles that will make her constantly wondering how far she is
        ready to go.</image:caption
