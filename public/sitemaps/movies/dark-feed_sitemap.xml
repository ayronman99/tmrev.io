        >When a film crew moves into an abandoned psychiatric hospital with a
        shadowy past to shoot a low budget horror film, they get more than they
        bargained for. The late nights and lack of sleep begin to take a toll,
        and the longer this crew works, the more the leaky, wet building seems
        to be coming back to life, feeding off its new inhabitants. As the shoot
        wears on, members of the crew exhibit increasingly strange behavior
        leaving those still sane realizing they need to get out of this place
        before they too succumb to the building's infectious hold, the only
        problem, the old hospital is not ready to let them go.</image:caption
