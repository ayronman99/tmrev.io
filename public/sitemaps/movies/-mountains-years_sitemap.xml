        >Chronicling the worldwide epic created by mountain climber Enzo Simone.
        10 Mountains 10 Years follows his international team of mountain
        climbers as they scale 10 of the greatest peaks in the world to raise
        awareness and funds for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease. Focusing on
        Mt. Kilimanjaro, the film tracks the greatest advances happening in the
        medical community alongside the team's endurance at altitude. This is a
        story of hope and of common everyday people coming together to change
        this world and leave something better behind. A collaboration with the
        Leeza Gibbons Memory Foundation and the Focus On a Cure Foundation for
        Parkinson's, proceeds from the film go towards medical research and
        caregiver programs.</image:caption
