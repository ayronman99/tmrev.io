        >This short documentary covers the Johns Committee, started by Florida
        State Senator Charley Johns to weed out Communists and homosexuals.
        Florida State University and the University of South Florida did not
        cooperate fully with the investigations, but the University of Florida,
        under the direction of J. Wayne Reitz, did. Several prominent gay men
        and lesbians were left unaffected by the investigations, while others
        had their careers left in shambles.</image:caption
