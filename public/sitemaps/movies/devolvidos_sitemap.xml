        >A document about the memory and life of men and women who lived in a
        Portuguese-American community and were once repatriated. Tony, Dulce,
        António, Manuel and Mário have one thing in common: they have been
        convicted in a harsh justice that repatriated them after many years of
        imprisonment. Within the Portuguese-American community to which they
        belonged, everyone worked regularly when the US authorities decided to
        reopen their court proceedings.</image:caption
