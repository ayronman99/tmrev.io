        >Jake Remy leads a gang of outlaw cutthroats making their escape toward
        Mexico from a successful robbery. Barring their way is a
        river--crossable only by means of a ferry barge. The barge operator,
        Travis, refuses to be bullied into providing transport for the gang and
        escapes across river with most of the local populace--leaving Remy and
        his gang behind, desperately seeking a way across. A river-wide
        stand-off begins between the gang and the townspeople, both groups of
        which have left people on the wrong side of the river.</image:caption
