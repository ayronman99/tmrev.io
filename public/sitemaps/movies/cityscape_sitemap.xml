        >Lena Sitnikova - obeying the will of her parents and her authoritative
        grandma - goes to the Medical School in order to keep the family
        tradition. However she dreams about a totally different life. For now
        she doesn't know what she exactly wants, till she meets Lyova - a
        painter, in his artistic depression. He introduces her into the world of
        art, galleries and art business. Lena finds her inner self, but the
        chosen life doesn't suit the plans of her parents: their daughter ought
        to be a medical student, even if they will have to force her. Lena goes
        through a lot of troubles: she fights with her parents, learns how to
        kiss and to say «I love you», how to walk the line on high heels and to
        defend her right to do what she wants. And there will certainly be a
        «happy end»...</image:caption
