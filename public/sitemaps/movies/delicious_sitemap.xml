        >France, 18th Century. The prestige of a noble house depends above all
        on the quality of its table. At the dawn of the French Revolution,
        gastronomy still is a prerogative of the aristocrats. When talented
        cooker Manceron is dismissed by the Duke of Chamfort, he loses the taste
        for cooking. Back in his country house, his meeting with the mysterious
        Louise gets him back on his feet. While they both feed a desire of
        revenge against the Duke, they decide to create the very first
        restaurant in France.</image:caption
