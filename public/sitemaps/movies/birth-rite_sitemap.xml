        >On her 18th birthday, Rebecca meets a mysterious man with magical
        powers. Roman, the warlock, shows her how her parents were murdered and
        bestows upon her the Sacred Amulet that is her birth rite. As she delves
        into the black arts of witchcraft, her adopted sister, Erin, fights to
        save her soul from the evil that has possessed her. It all ends in a
        showdown of good and evil as Erin and Roman battle for
        Rebecca.</image:caption
