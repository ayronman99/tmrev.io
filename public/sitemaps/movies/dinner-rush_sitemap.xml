        >One unlucky evening, Louis Cropa, a part-time bookmaker, discovers that
        his restaurant has become a hotbed of conflicting characters. In
        addition to having to please a whiny food critic, Louis must fend off a
        hostile takeover from a pair of gangsters, to whom his sous-chef is in
        debt. Further, Louis has an argument with his son, the star chef, whose
        culinary creativity has brought success to the business.</image:caption
