        >311 has had a history of celebrating their namesake on the 11th of the
        third month (March) each even-numbered year, almost always after having
        released an album the previous summer. The celebration consisted of a
        live concert, a tradition over recent years has developed for the band
        to out-perform themselves in regard to the previous '311 Day'. The
        result is a 64-song set list featuring album tracks and a large
        collection of b-sides recorded at UNO Lakefront Arena in New Orleans on
        March 11, 2004.</image:caption
