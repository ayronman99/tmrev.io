        >A Calling to Care is the inspiring story of 55 year-old Grace Stanley,
        a Canadian nurse who left her home and prestigious career behind to
        answer a calling halfway around the world in Karachi, Pakistan. Teaching
        nursing to local women in a strict Muslim culture that forbids them to
        even to touch men is a formidable task. However, Grace challenges her
        own values and belief systems to find common ground with her students,
        helping them to excel and feel respect for themselves in a culture that
        doesn't respect them. Whether it is getting her hands painted with
        henna, swimming fully-clothed in the ocean, or marching bravely with
        them on International Women's Day, Grace bonds with her students in a
        very special way, and ultimately discovers how the West can learn a lot
        more from the Third World than she ever thought.</image:caption
