        >The story evolves around Benjie (Coco Martin), a young security guard
        who, having lost her girlfriend from another man, has also lost his
        sense of being. Without a family to lean on, he requests to the building
        administration to let him stay in guard's quarters of the new condo he
        was assigned at. The building and the whole new universe of strangers
        who don't really care about him has become Benjie's refuge. He only
        cares about his job even if it's only the same old tiring routine. But
        the perfect and lonely world for him turned out as a contrary when a
        mysterious intruder and a phone call from an empty unit begin taunting
        him.</image:caption
