        >In a shabby residence on the coast between Livorno and Pisa, Mario,
        known as "Il Cormorano", a grumpy and disillusioned young man, works as
        a plumber to scrape together the sum necessary to realize his dream. He
        wants to join his uncle Piero in America to become an underground
        musician. His story is intertwined with that of Nevio, the cynical
        manager of the residence, of Gabriella, his naive and dreamy lover and
        of the maid Gaia who behind has a past as a drug addict, with whom Mario
        has a relationship of hate love. But reality is not as rosy as
        dreams:</image:caption
