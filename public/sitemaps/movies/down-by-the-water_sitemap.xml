        >In a forest river, hunters find the body of a young singer named Yanka
        Diaghilev. From that moment on, a confusing chronicle of the last day in
        the girl's life begins, during which she will travel a long way - from
        the city to the dacha, and then into the thicket to the river. On this
        day, Yanka will have time to see and talk with many people, real and
        imaginary, even with those who are no longer alive. It seems that
        Yankee's next step is about to shed light on the circumstances of her
        mysterious death: hopeless love, arguments with loved ones,
        disagreements with herself, strange meetings with strangers in the
        forest.</image:caption
