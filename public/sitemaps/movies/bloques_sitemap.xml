        >The film is made up of two stories: In Block 1 the story of Manuel, a
        lonely and gray man, whose attitude distances him from all those around
        him, even from his own son. In the midst of routine and alcohol, the
        hope of a new love arises. This is how Norma, a bar bartender, enters
        his life without realizing it. In Block 2, the Aristiguetas, an
        upper-class Venezuelan family, have moved, economically less due to the
        failed decisions of their father. Alejandra, the oldest of the
        Aristigueta children, has lived in New York for some years, ignoring the
        reality of her family and her country. While for Alejandra the trip back
        to Venezuela becomes an encounter with herself, assuming control of her
        family's destiny, her brother Francisco explores life in the alleys of
        the neighborhood.</image:caption
