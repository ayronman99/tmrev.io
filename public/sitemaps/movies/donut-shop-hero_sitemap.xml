        >Pete spends his typical morning patrolling a park, teaching himself how
        to whistle to pass the time. Pete's day takes a turn when he decides he
        needs a donut. Inside a local donut shop he's mistaken for a police
        officer and hesitantly basks in the misplaced glory. When suddenly two
        armed men burst in, guns flashing. As tension mounts, the whole donut
        shop looks to Pete to save them. Terror will reign. Love will be tested.
        And one person will rise from the dust a donut shop hero.</image:caption
