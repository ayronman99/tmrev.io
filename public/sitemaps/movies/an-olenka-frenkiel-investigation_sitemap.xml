        >In 1996 Regina Louf came forward to the Belgian authorities to say she
        had spent years as the victim of a paedophile network. During all-night
        police interrogations she poured out a terrifying tale of systematic
        abuse, torture and even murder. Her tearful account described child sex
        orgies involving politicians and other members of the country's elite; a
        Belgian underworld that no one wanted to believe, least of all the
        establishment. For years there was a huge effort to discredit her
        evidence, but now in an exclusive interview, the policeman at the centre
        of her investigation has finally broken his silence. He claims that his
        enquiry was blocked - because it threatened to reveal too
        much.</image:caption
