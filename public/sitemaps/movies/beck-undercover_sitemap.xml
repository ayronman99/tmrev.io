        >A young gang member is found dead, and the Beck group's investigation
        indicates that a drug network is behind it. Klas Fredén has been
        monitoring the network for a long time, and the Beck group - led by Alex
        Beijer - is most graciously allowed to work with the murder
        investigation in parallel. She will soon end up on a collision course
        with Fredén. Thus, Martin Beck, who is now head of department, is also
        involved in the case.</image:caption
