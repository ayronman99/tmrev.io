        >The young veterinarian Christine from Vienna stands on the sunny side
        of life. She is in a relationship with the attractive management
        consultant Alexander, has just completed her doctorate and is looking
        forward to a dream job. And she is also unexpectedly pregnant. But after
        an altercation with Alexander, she loses the child. She desperately
        flees to her father Georg, a painter to whom she had no contact for many
        years. He lives on an inherited family estate in Saxony. But instead of
        rest there is new excitement. At the neighboring riding school she gets
        together with coach Markus. His rude methods of horse education do not
        suit her at all. After some difficulties, the two get together and she
        can also win the trust of a difficult, valuable horse.</image:caption
