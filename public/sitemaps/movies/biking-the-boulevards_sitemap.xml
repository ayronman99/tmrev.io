        >In Biking the Boulevards, Geoffrey Baer bikes his way across Chicago,
        using the city's network of boulevards. The boulevards are wide,
        tree-lined streets, which connect Chicago's largest parks. This system
        of parks and boulevards was the first of its kind in the country -
        imagined nearly 150 years ago. Discover how these boulevards came to be
        and explore these magnificent parks, from Washington and Sherman Parks
        on the South Side, to Douglas, Humboldt and Garfield on the West. These
        green spaces are often overlooked, but they're every bit as beautiful as
        Chicago's famous lakefront parks. Geoffrey invites you to take a new
        look at the old neighborhoods that emerged along these boulevards in the
        19th Century. Places like Bronzeville, Englewood, Back of the Yards,
        Lawndale, Humboldt Park, and Logan Square. Many of these enclaves have
        seen their share of hard times over the years, but hidden just beneath
        the surfaceâ€¦you'll find some remarkable surprises.</image:caption
