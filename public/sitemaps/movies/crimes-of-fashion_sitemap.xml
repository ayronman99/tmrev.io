        >Brooke, a plain but creative and hard-working student at the top
        fashion school in the nation, who has come a long way from her tough
        childhood spent going from one foster home to another as an orphan. She
        has always dreamed of becoming a fashion designer, and is thrilled to
        finally be on her way. But, when the grandfather she never knew about
        passes away, her life is suddenly turned upside down. Not only has he
        left her his estate, but he's left her in charge of the family business,
        as mob boss to one of the top crime syndicates that has been trying to
        go legit. If that isn't enough, the handsome new student she's falling
        for is actually an undercover FBI agent aiming to get dirt on her to
        bring down the family empire.</image:caption
