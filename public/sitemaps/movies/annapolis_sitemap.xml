        >Jake Huard, from a shipbuilders family, promised his dying mother he'ld
        make it to Anapolis Naval Academy. Thanks to tenaciously bugging a
        Congressman, he's selected despite dubious grades. Once inside, Jake
        soon proves sub-standard academically. Constantly challenged to his
        limits, repeatedly made the 'over-cocky' reason for the entire class to
        suffer, Jake nearly quits, but after facing his utterly un-supportive
        father's gloating returns just in time. Stubborn Jake finds support
        withs mates as well as Senor Ali, his lover-to-be, and a discipline he
        may excel in: the 'brigade' boxing tournament, open to all
        ranks.</image:caption
