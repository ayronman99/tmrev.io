        >An intertwining story of murder and mystery across two decades. In the
        early twentieth century, several pregnant girls meet in a country house,
        where they have been sent to give birth and have their children adopted.
        The girls are never seen by outsiders again. Almost twenty years later,
        two historians return to the house to research the case, and when the
        disturbing truth is revealed, the dark story continues.</image:caption
