        >With his grizzled moustache and chiselled features, Charles Bronson is
        the embodiment of a slightly archaic, brooding and almost reactionary
        virility. But who is he really? Often hired to play marginalised Native
        American or Mexican characters before he was typecast as the image of a
        lone killer, Bronson was a major figure in the popular cinema of the
        1960s and 70s and his stony-faced, physical acting and career are worthy
        of a second look.</image:caption
