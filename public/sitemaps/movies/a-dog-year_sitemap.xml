        >Jon Katz is close to burnout. He's a writer with writer's block; his
        wife has left for her sister's because he's emotionally distant; he
        rarely answers his phone. A kennel sends him a border collie that's
        undisciplined because of abuse. Despite a series of mishaps, Jon decides
        to keep trying with the dog, and he rents a dilapidated farm house to
        give the dog room to run. A local handyman refers Jon to a woman who
        might be able to help him train the dog. Reluctantly, Jon gives her a
        try. Is the dog the problem, or the owner?</image:caption
