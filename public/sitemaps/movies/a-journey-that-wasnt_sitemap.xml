        >An expedition leaves Ushuaia for the Antarctic circle. Pierre Huyghe,
        along with six other artists, is brought aboard Jean-Louis Etienne's
        boat in search of an uncharted island inhabited by a strange creature.
        Imprisoned by ice floats, they come across an albino penguin that they
        capture with their recording station. Six months later, on the Wollman
        Ice Rink in New York's Central Park -- another sea of ice -- Joshua Cody
        conducts his orchestral score inspired by the expedition's topographical
        records.</image:caption
