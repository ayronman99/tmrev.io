        >One of the greatest playwrights of the 20th century, Arthur Miller
        created such celebrated works as Death of a Salesman and The Crucible,
        which continue to move audiences around the world today. He also made
        headlines for being targeted by the House Un-American Activities
        Committee at the height of the McCarthy Era and entering into a
        tumultuous marriage with Hollywood icon Marilyn Monroe. Told from the
        unique perspective of his daughter, filmmaker Rebecca Miller, Arthur
        Miller: Writer is an illuminating portrait that combines interviews
        spanning decades and a wealth of personal archival material, and
        provides new insights into Millerâ€™s life as an artist and exploring his
        character in all its complexity.</image:caption
