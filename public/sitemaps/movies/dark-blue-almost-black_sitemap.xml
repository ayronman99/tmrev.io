        >Jorge is a young man whose plans for the future are put on hold when
        his father has a stroke. For seven years, he diligently nurses his
        father and works as a janitor while studying part time to get a business
        degree.When Natalia, his childhood crush, returns from a stint studying
        abroad, Jorge begins to yearn for something better. He is desperate to
        find a new and better job, but finds that no one will hire him because
        he has experience only as a janitor. Antonio, Jorgeâ€™s older brother,
        soon to be released from jail, is an opportunist who has never gotten
        along with their father. In prison, at a theater workshop, Antonio meets
        Paula, a beautiful young woman in jail on drug charges. Paula has a
        problem because she flirted with another inmate's
        boyfriend.</image:caption
