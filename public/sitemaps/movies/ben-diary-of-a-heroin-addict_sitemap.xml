        >Ben Rogers was a bright schoolboy from a loving, middle class family.
        He played in the orchestra, loved cricket and enjoyed the annual family
        holiday. But his future promise was halted when he started taking drugs
        in his teens. Early drinking led to cannabis, harder drugs, and then the
        revelation to his family, at the age of 21, that he was addicted to
        heroin. Over the next 13 years Ben and his family battled with his
        addiction, going through detox, rehab and attempts at 'cold turkey', but
        his health gradually declined. Whilst attempting another detox aged 34,
        he died from a brain haemorrhage. But during the last two years of his
        life, Ben filmed an unflinching video diary showing his final desperate
        attempts to come off heroin. It's a portrayal of his descent; intimate,
        raw, and at times difficult to watch, he talks to his glove puppet as he
        injects into a vein in his groin.</image:caption
