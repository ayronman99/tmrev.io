        >Stefan, a gay bartender in a trendy club, doesn't care a lot about his
        professional and personal future. One night, the mysterious Martin
        stares at him, so he thinks that his guest searches a quick love affair.
        Stefan invites him to his apartment, where Martin is rather surprised at
        his intentions and explains that he doesn't want sex, but his attention
        for their common past. Martin searches his father, a foreign worker from
        Italy, who is also Stefan's originator, which he didn't know. Their
        mother kept Martin, while Stefan was adopted. After the first shock,
        Stefan decides to join his "new brother" on his trip to Italy. They only
        have some photos and letters of a holiday trip to Cattolica and their
        father's name: Giuseppe Iacoviello. This is the beginning of an odyssey
        across Italy and their way to themselves...</image:caption
