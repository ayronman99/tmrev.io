        >While silent-film star Charlie Chaplin may have charmed American
        audiences with the onscreen antics of his lovable "Tramp" character, the
        actor's private life was marred by a series of public scandals that
        eventually pushed him into exile. In addition to his penchant for much
        younger women, Chaplin was unjustly hounded by Senator Joe McCarthy's
        notorious anti-Communist witch hunts, for which the U.S. revoked his
        visa in 1952. A bitter and disenchanted Chaplin responded by moving his
        family to Switzerland, where he remained until his death in 1977. This
        documentary chronicles Chaplin's life and career during those so-called
        "forgotten years" (during which he became a prolific and highly
        respected film-score composer) through previously unreleased archival
        footage and intimate interviews with his friends and family, including
        his children Geraldine, Michael, and Eugene.</image:caption
