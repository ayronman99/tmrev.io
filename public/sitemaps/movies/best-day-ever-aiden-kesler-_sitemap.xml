        >Comedy - Recently diagnosed with cancer, free-spirited teen Aiden
        Kesler grabs his video camera, his two best friends and documents their
        best day ever. Unaware of Aiden's cancer, his friends quickly jump on
        board, skip school and enjoy their day off. After challenging the school
        bully to a fight, Aiden continues to push his own boundaries and those
        of his friends as the day begins to spiral out of control. - Andrew
