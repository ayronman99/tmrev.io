        >A young single mother of four living in a small Texas town. Arrested
        during a drug raid and accused of a crime she didn't commit, Dee goes
        against the wishes of her mother, Alma, and rejects the plea-bargain
        that would free her from jail, but brand her as a felon for life. As
        word begins to spread that similar incidents are occurring in poor
        communities all across the country, Dee realizes that there are more
        mothers out there like her, and decides to take a stand against powerful
        district attorney Calvin Beckett. Now, despite being well aware of
        District Attorney Beckett's fierce reputation, Dee enlists the aid of
        ACLU attorney David Cohen and former narcotics officer Sam Conroy in
        overcoming the seemingly insurmountable obstacles that, if not navigated
        with the greatest of caution, now threaten to destroy her life. With the
        custody of her children on the line, one brave mother wages a valiant
        battle to strike at the very heart of the corrupt Texas justice
        system.</image:caption
