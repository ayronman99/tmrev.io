        >A pair of men are picking and repeatedly enter houses here and there to
        steal. One day, while ransacking the house they have been picking, they
        find the girl who lives in the house collapsed in the bathroom. She is a
        college student who has been hurt by a love like a game that is about to
        end. When she gets up and sees the two thieves, she says, "You came to
        save me, didn't you? Will you stay with me forever?" For some reason,
        she interprets this favorably and trusts them. From that point on, a
        strange interaction between the three begins.</image:caption
