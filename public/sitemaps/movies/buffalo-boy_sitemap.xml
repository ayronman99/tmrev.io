        >Set along the southern coast of Vietnam during the French occupation in
        the 1940s, water is everywhere, giving life and bringing decay and rot.
        Kim is 15; his father and step-mother have two buffalo, their lifeline
        as subsistence rice farmers. During the rainy season, there's no grass
        and the buffalo are starving. Kim volunteers to take the beasts inland
        to find food. On this coming-of-age journey, Kim sees men mistreat
        women, men fight with men, and French taxes rob the poor. He works for
        Lap, a buffalo herder whose past is entangled with Kim's parents, and he
        makes friends who will lead him to his place in the
        world.</image:caption
