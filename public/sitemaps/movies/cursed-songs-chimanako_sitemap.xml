        >Misaki is a popular bar hostess whose policy is to 'live on presents'.
        She is haughty and wants nothing but the most expensive and exclusive.
        One night, she finds a rabbit and takes it home, setting off the story
        of an unimaginable tragedy. It is an 'animal panic horror' film with a
        new edge presenting an allegory of the worst in the modern materialistic
        world. This is the first full-length feature film for Yuichi Kanemaru,
        who has worked as assistant director to Kaneto Shindo, Yasuo Furuhata
        and Takashi Miike. And Tomoko Tabata's dynamic performance in her first
        horror movie is a definite highlight.</image:caption
