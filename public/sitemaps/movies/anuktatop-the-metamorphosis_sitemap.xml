        >Down on the banks of the Maroni River, little Derreck dreams of heroic
        warriors. He’s a member of the Wayana tribe in French Guyana. In this
        film, Derreck is not our only portal into another world. His sister
        Sylvana also dreams – of an impossible love, who belongs to a different
        tribe. Their grandmother Malilou takes us back to her youth in the
        1950s. It seems that everyone wanders off now and again into a parallel,
        at times almost ghostly world. Whereas the youngest members of the tribe
        can still lose themselves in boundless flights of fantasy, the older
        generation contemplates more existential questions. How do dreams of the
        future relate to identity? What makes you a real Wayana?</image:caption
