        >Berlin 36 is a 2009 German film telling the fate of Jewish athlete
        Gretel Bergmann in the 1936 Summer Olympics. She was replaced by the
        Nazi regime by an athlete later discovered to be a man. The film is
        based on a true story and was released in Germany on September 10, 2009.
        Reporters at Der Spiegel challenged the historical basis for many of the
        events in the film, pointing to arrest records and medical examinations
        indicating German authorities did not learn Dora Ratjen was male until
        1938.</image:caption
