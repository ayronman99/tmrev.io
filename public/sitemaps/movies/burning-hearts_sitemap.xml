        >Puglia. Burnt by the sun and by hatred, the promontory of Gargano is
        contested by criminals who seem to come from a remote past governed by
        the law of the jungle. An archaic land reminiscent of the Far West, in
        which blood is washed away with blood. An old feud between two rival
        families is rekindled by a forbidden love: the one between Andrea,
        reluctant heir of the Malatesta, and Marilena, beautiful wife of the
        boss of the Camporeale clan. A fatal passion that sets the two clans at
        war again. But Marilena, banished by the Camporeale and prisoner of the
        Malatesta, disputed and abused, will oppose a fate already written with
        a motherâ€™s strength.</image:caption
