        >On October 15, 1988, Notre Dame hosted the University of Miami in what
        would become one of the greatest games in college football history. It
        was tradition vs. swagger, the No. 4-ranked Fighting Irish versus the
        No. 1-ranked Hurricanes, one coaching star, Lou Holtz, versus another,
        Jimmy Johnson. But the name still attached to the contest came from a
        t-shirt manufactured by a few Notre Dame students: “Catholics vs.
        Convicts.” As compelling as the tale of Notre Dame’s dramatic victory
        is—even losing quarterback Steve Walsh calls it “a helluva ballgame”—the
        backstory is just as riveting.</image:caption
