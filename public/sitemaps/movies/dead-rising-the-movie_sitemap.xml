        >Live action film "Shibyo Osen Dead Rising" based on the zombie action
        game "Dead Rising." Set in Japan and directed by Keiji Inafune. Produced
        by Capcom, the game studio that also produced the popular Resident Evil
        series, the Xbox 360/Wii game Dead Rising was a George Romero-inspired
        third-person shooting game that followed a reporter's effort to fend off
        a zombie attack in a mall. The game was immensely popular, expanding to
        downloadable content and multiple spin-off versions on other platforms.
        Four years later, the sequel of the game has arrived, and Capcom is
        hyping up the release with a live-action feature film. Directed by game
        producer Inafune Keiji (Onimusha, Mega Man) in his directorial debut,
        Shibyo Osen - Dead Rising promises to create a never-before-seen type of
        third-person-style action film that also features the over-the-top
        zombie violence that made the games so popular.</image:caption
