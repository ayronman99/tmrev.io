        >In the age of social media, nearly every day brings a new eruption of
        outrage. While people have always found something to be offended by,
        their ability to organize a groundswell of opposition to – and public
        censure of – their offender has never been more powerful. Today we're
        all one clumsy joke away from public ruin. Can We Take A Joke? offers a
        thought-provoking and wry exploration of outrage culture through the
        lens of stand-up comedy, with notables like Gilbert Gottfried, Penn
        Jillette, Lisa Lampanelli, and Adam Carolla detailing its stifling
        impact on comedy and the exchange of ideas. What will the future will be
        like if we can't learn how to take a joke?</image:caption
