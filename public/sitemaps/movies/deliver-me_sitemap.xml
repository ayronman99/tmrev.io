        >A film on the come back of exorcism in the contemporary world. Each
        year a growing number of people call their sense of unease “possession.”
        The Church answers to this spiritual emergency nominating an increasing
        number of exorcist priests and organizing training courses. Father
        Cataldo is one of the most sought-after exorcists in Sicily and
        elsewhere; he is famous for his tireless fighting spirit. Every Tuesday
        Gloria, Enrico, Anna, and Giulia, along with many others, attend Father
        Cataldo’s mass for deliverance, trying to find a cure for a sense of
        discomfort that has no answer nor a name. Whether believers or not, how
        far are we prepared to go to get recognition for our own disease? What
        are we prepared to do to be delivered from it, here and
        now?</image:caption
