        >Fast paced, action packed comedy. Tension flares in The Motor City as
        Officer Richardson profiles every Muslim he sees as a terrorist. He goes
        on an arrest frenzy, which makes the community activists, Jihad and
        Osama take to the streets and rally the people to stand up for their
        rights. The Chief of Police wants to gain the trust of the Muslim
        community in order to get re-elected, but Attorney Leila Rodriguez is
        standing in the way with a discrimination law suit against Officer
        Richardson and the Motor City Police Department. The Chief calls on his
        most unreliable detective, Mohammed and partners him with a Middle
        Eastern, Sharia Law fanatic, Detective Abdul. The Chief wants them to
        "Speak Muslim To The Muslims" which he thinks will guarantee his
        re-election. - Written by Omar Regan</image:caption
