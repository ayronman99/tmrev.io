        >All Together was a professional wrestling event organized together by
        Japan's three biggest promotions; All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW), New
        Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) and Pro Wrestling Noah, in response to the
        March 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami. The first event was held in
        Tokyo on August 27, 2011. All proceeds from the events were donated to
        Japanese Red Cross. The event featured no storylines or championship
        matches, instead it was booked as a "supercard", putting together
        combinations of wrestlers from the three promotions that fans would
        normally not see. The event featured ten matches involving 82
