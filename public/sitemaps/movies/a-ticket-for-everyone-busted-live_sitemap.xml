        >The Busted Live DVD A Ticket For Everyone follows the Live CD album of
        the same name, and features concert footage of all the band's hits from
        their previous 2 million-selling studio albums Busted & A Present For

        others, bonus material including a band documentary, screensavers and
        videos to several of Busted's biggest hits. Includes the live version of
        current single, "She Wants To Be Me".</image:caption
