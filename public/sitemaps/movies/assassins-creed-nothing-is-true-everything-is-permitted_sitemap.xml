        >Frederick and Lucienda's lives were a tranquil and happy one until the
        fateful day when she and their home are targeted by an organization
        calling itself the "Templar Order". Go back in time and witness the
        beginning lessons and most telling memories of Frederick Julian as he

        allegiance to the guided philosophy "Nothing is True. Everything is
        Permitted".</image:caption
