        >Leroy Lowe, grand dragon of the Texas Ku Klux Klan confronts everything
        he's been taught to hate when he's sentenced to three years of hard
        labor on a prison work farm, where Warden Merville, dead set on
        rehabilitating Leroy, chooses Emilio, a Hispanic field worker imprisoned
        for fighting for labor rights, to be his cell-mate. Leroy, confined in a
        small cell with the enemy, far from the KKK comrades who deserted him,
        finds the chatty Emilio slowly chipping away at his anger and prejudice.
        His weekly rehabilitation meetings with the warden, barely tolerable as
        the man drones on about farm labor and field crops, take on a different
        meaning when Madalena, a beautiful Mexican maid is hired to clean the
        warden's office. An unconventional love story develops that opens
        Leroy's eyes to the possibility of a different life. And a man who was a
        born and bred racist finds himself heading down a completely different
        path to salvation.</image:caption
