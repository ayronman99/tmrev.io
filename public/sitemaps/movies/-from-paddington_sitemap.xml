        >Toko Amano worked as a detective, but to take care of her sick husband
        she quit her job. After her husband passed away, Toko Amano now works as
        a crisis management expert. 3 days ago, Toko Amano's former
        mother-in-law rode on an express train with beds. She witnessed a man
        strangling a woman and told the train conductor, but he thought she
        imagined it. The police later searched for the woman's body, but could
        not find her. Toko Amano boards the same express train that her former
        mother-in-law rode. She looks for the dead body.</image:caption
