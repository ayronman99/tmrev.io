        >With his directorial debut actor Chen Jianbin walks in the footsteps of
        A Touch of Sin, No Man’s Land, and Black Coal, Thin Ice and offers a
        hard-edged mainland noir where kindness and cruelty, madness and reason,
        greed and humanity all struggle for dominance and the fool might not be
        who you think . The hook here is Chen’s amazing performance as the
        simple, slightly crude Latioazi, a goat farmer who has a son in jail.
        When a young mentally handicapped man follows him home one day and
        enters his life, it sets off a blaze and a chain of events follows,
        which bares China’s class divide raw. His random act of reluctant
        kindness invites a parade of strangers and grifters all intent on
        draining Latioazi of what little he has.</image:caption
