        >The divorced florist Maria falls in love with the fated Holger, whose
        little son was killed two years ago in an accident with a driver's
        escape. Maria also has a son: the now-grown Niklas, a very talented
        pianist who has a great career in the eyes of his proud mother. But
        appearances are deceptive: little by little Maria finds out that two
        years ago Niklas gave up his career as a pianist because of a shocking
        experience that completely threw him off track. Is he perhaps the death
        driver?</image:caption
