        >Jia Zhangke travels with painter Liu Xiaodong from China to Thailand as
        they as they meet everyday workers in the throes of social turmoil. Liu
        Xiaodong is well-known for his monumental canvases, particularly those
        inspired by China's Three Gorges Dam project. Jia Zhangke visits Liu on
        the banks of Fengjie, a city about to be swallowed up by the Yangtze
        River. The area is in the process of being "de-constructed" by armies of
        shirtless male workers who form the subject of Liu's paintings. Liu and
        Jia next travel to Bangkok, where Liu paints Thai sex workers
        languishing in brothels. The two sets of paintings are united in their
        subjects' shared sense of malaise in the face of the dehumanizing labor
        afforded them.</image:caption
