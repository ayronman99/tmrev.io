        >Documentary exploring one of Japan's biggest train crashes in modern
        history, caused when a driver tried to catch up with a delay of just 80
        seconds. It's a cautionary tale of what happens when punctuality,
        protocol and efficiency are taken to the extreme. On Monday April 25th
        2005, a West Japan Railway commuter train crashed into an apartment
        building and killed 107 people. Just what pressures made the driver risk
        so much for such a minimal delay? Piecing together personal accounts of
        those affected by the train crash, with insights from experts and former
        train drivers, the film poses a question for a society that equates
        speed with progress. It offers a fascinating insight into the railway's
        role in Japan's post-war economic boom and the dangers of corner-cutting
        in the prolonged economic stagnation that followed. Through the lens of
        this catastrophic train crash, Brakeless considers the ultimate cost
        efficiency.</image:caption
