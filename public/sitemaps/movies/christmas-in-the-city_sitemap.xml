        >With the threat of having to close her father's candy store, Wendy and
        her six-year-old daughter Grace travel to the big city in hopes of
        making extra holiday cash to save the store. When she's offered a job in
        the toy department of Wolmans, the city's biggest department store,
        Wendy can't wait! Her excitement doesn't last long when the store's
        manager, Teanna, destroys the Christmas spirit throughout the store and
        replaces Santa with a hunky male underwear model surrounded by elfin
        "babes." What Teanna is unaware of is that she has in fact sacked the
        real Santa. Unaware of his real "Santa" status, Wendy reaches out to the
        old man but it seems even he has given up hope. With her daughter losing
        faith in the holiday, Wendy realizes she must bring the true meaning of
        Christmas back to Wolmans before it is too late.</image:caption
