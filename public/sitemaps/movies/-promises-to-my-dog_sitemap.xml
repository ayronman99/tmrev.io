        >One day a puppy comes to the house of Akari, who has just turned
        twelve, and was trying hard to act strong after her mother suddenly fell
        ill. She immediately falls in love with the puppy and names it "Socks"
        after the paws which looked like they had white socks on. Akari was
        together with Socks day and night. However, as Akari grows up, her
        feelings and interest moves away from Socks. Year by year, their
        distance grows, which also leads to her physical distance as she moves
        to a far off city, and must leave Socks behind to a childhood friend.One
        day Akari remembers the 10 promises that she had made with Socks and her
        deceased mother...</image:caption
