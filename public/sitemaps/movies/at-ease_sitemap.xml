        >A young Naval Aviator, Kevin, is killed in action just days before he
        was to be discharged under "Don't Ask, Don't Tell." When his partner,
        Tyler, arrives at his funeral unexpectedly, his father, Bill, finds out
        more than he wants to know about his son. Throughout their encounter,
        Bill wrestles with his own prejudices as Tyler tries to tell the truth
        about his son and their relationship. But, as Tyler finds out, the truth
        has consequences in a military that does not welcome gays and lesbians
        openly into their ranks. They represent the tens of thousands of brave
        men and women who daily fight for freedom, yet have none
        themselves.</image:caption
