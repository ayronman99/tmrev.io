        >Sir André Previn, born in Berlin in 1929, figures among the most
        prominent musicians of the 20th and early 21st centuries. He won four
        Academy Awards for his film scores, he composes concertos, musicals and
        operas. He conducts, arranges music, and is a renowned pianist, as well
        as a jazz musician. Previn’s first opera, ‚A Streetcar Named Desire’,
        based on Tennessee Williams’ play, successfully premiered in San
        Francisco, in 1998. Our film mirrors Sir Previn’s affinities to Europe
        as well as to the United States. He is at home in both worlds, with
        their rather different cultural realities.</image:caption
