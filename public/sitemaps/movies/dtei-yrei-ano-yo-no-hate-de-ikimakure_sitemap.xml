        >Nobuo, a virgin, was invited by Ayumi (Makoto Toda) to her house
        saying, "I don't have my parents today, so it's okay." He rushed out of
        the house and was run over by a car and taken to the hospital. Nobuo
        wanders the deadline, but it seems he hasn't died yet. And Nobuo, who
        isn't going, follows the woman who pulled herself, and when she looks
        into her life, a ghost in white costume appears and approaches Nobuo who
        is frightened.　</image:caption
