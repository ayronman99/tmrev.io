        >Christmas and New Year. Three girls between 18 and 20, are hospitalized
        with cancer. All three of them have serious problems, not just in terms
        of health, but also in terms of their relationships with their nearest
        and dearest. The girls find a haven in each other's company, where they
        are free from the fear of death and loneliness, and a substantial part
        of the film describes their sense of humour, unrestrained candidness and
        uncompromising zest for life.</image:caption
