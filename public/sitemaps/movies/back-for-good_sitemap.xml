        >Three women, one family: Monika the mother, Angie the older sister and
        Kiki the baby of the family. Angie is a reality-TV star who is doggedly
        clinging onto her fading career. Fresh out of rehab, she suddenly finds
        herself without any money, friends or a place to live and is condemned
        to returning to her mother in her hated dump of a hometown. Angie's
        teenage sister Kiki is also finding life tough-going. Due to her
        epilepsy, her mother Monika insists that she wears a freaky protective
        helmet. The consequence: Kiki is ostracised and bullied, her life has
        long since become the hell from which her mother is trying to protect
        her.</image:caption
