        >She was her generation’s Madonna and Bob Dylan rolled into one—and yet,
        by the 1970s, major poetry anthologies no longer mentioned Edna St.
        Vincent Millay. She had become a lost poet, her literary status
        mirroring her untimely death. This program documents the brief yet
        bright “candle” of Millay’s artistic development, from her early years
        in Maine to her achievements in the literary world of New York, while
        exploring her celebrity, sexuality, and personal relationships. Among
        the many eye-opening locations featured in the film is the house in
        which Millay spent her final years; its contents have remained untouched
        since the poet’s death and provide a catalyst for the study of her
        troubled, exuberant life. Never-before-seen archival images and
        interviews with Millay scholars also enrich the
        narrative.</image:caption
