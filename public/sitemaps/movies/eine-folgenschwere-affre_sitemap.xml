        >Benno, commissar in the Homicide Department Munich and married to
        forensic doctor Andrea, finds himself one day in a seemingly unsolvable,
        fatal situation again. His lover Sabine, who is ironically the wife of
        his superior, chief commissioner Hartmut, is found murdered in her
        sister, Martha's home. Benno is summoned to the scene in this murder
        case. Hartmut can not manage the investigation as a husband and thus
        transfers the case to Benno. All others come under suspicion for this:
        his wife, his father-in-law and the widower. Everyone had a motive,
        everyone was at the scene. But even Benno himself comes as a perpetrator
        in question: On the morning of the murder his lover had put an end to
        him.</image:caption
