        >Daniele is a young man from Santâ€™Erasmo, an island on the edges of the
        Venice Lagoon. He lives on his wits, isolated even from his peer group
        who are busy exploring an existence of pleasure-seeking expressed in the
        cult of the barchino (motorboat). This obsession focuses on the building
        of ever more powerful engines to transform the little lagoon launches
        into dangerously fast racing boats. Daniele too dreams of a
        record-breaking barchino, one that will take him to the top of the
        leader board, but everything he does to further his dream and win
        respect from the others turns out to be tragically counterproductive.
        The decline that erodes the relationships, environment and habits of a
        rootless generation is observed from the timeless perspective of the
        Venetian landscape and its island outskirts: the point of no return is a
        foolish, vestigial tale of male initiation. Violent and destined to
        fail, it explodes dragging the ghost city along on a psychedelic
        shipwreck.</image:caption
