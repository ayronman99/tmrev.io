        >Filmed in 1974 and edited and released in 1983 (and then rereleased by
        its director in 2005), DEAD PEOPLE purports to document the final years
        of Frank Butler, a local fixture in the depressed burg of Ellicot City
        with a particular fondness for drink and tales of the dead. Over hazy
        16mm footage two decades later, Deutsch adopted a painfully
        unsentimental view of his early approach, colored as it was by notions
        of ethnographic film and an undercurrent of fetishism for a man he
        considered somehow more "alive" than himself. While it chafes against
        notions of authenticity in documentary and incisively hints at the
        complicity of the subject in inventing his own history, DEAD PEOPLE
        simultaneously oozes nostalgia, transcending its own judgment as a gauzy
        memorial for the man Deutsch once called a friend.</image:caption
