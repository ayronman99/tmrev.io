        >The story is about Sameer (Mammootty), a sweeper with the Alapuzha
        Municipality, who is always on tenterhooks because he is on the police
        radar whenever there is trouble or an act of terror occurs. Later it is
        revealed that his brother-in-law Shahjahan (Unni Mukundan) was suspected
        to be part of the terror team that had planted bombs in Bombay in 1993
        and was later killed in an encounter with the Army in Andhra
        Pradesh.</image:caption
