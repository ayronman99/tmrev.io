        >After 81 days of solitary detention world famous Chinese artist Ai
        Weiwei is put under house arrest. He suffers from sleeping disorder and
        memory loss, 18 cameras are monitoring his studio and home, police
        agents follow his every move, and heavy restrictions from the Kafkaesque
        Chinese authorities weigh him down. Journalists, the art world and his
        family all want a piece of him and on top of that he is met with a
        gigantic lawsuit from the Chinese government, soon to be named 'The Fake
        Case'. Ai Weiwei is shaken, but during the year on probation he steadily
        finds new ways to provoke and challenge the mighty powers of the Chinese
        authorities in his fight for human rights. Ai Weiwei strongly believes
        that China is ready for change. And he will do everything to make it
        happen.</image:caption
