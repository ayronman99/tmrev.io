        >Musician, actress, scientist, visionary, video artist, composer and
        teacher: Björk is one of the most versatile contemporary artists.
        Breaking down the limitations of art genres, for three decades Björk has
        used the power of images and of himself as an artist to evoke
        unforgettable emotions. Her video clips are milestones in video art. But
        Björk doesn't just want to be creative herself, she encourages her fans
        to pass on her knowledge. This year, this visionary artist is
        celebrating her 50th birthday. In honor of this, the Museum of Modern
        Art in New York is honoring her with a retrospective.</image:caption
