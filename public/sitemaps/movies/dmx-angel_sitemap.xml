        >Angel is a fascinating glimpse into the psyche of rap's most conflicted
        and charismatic MC. DMX commands arena stages, wrecks his competition in
        battles, and takes time to show fans some tough love. Leading off this
        two-hour tale of the X is the 20-minute short "Angel" directed by Bill
        Duke. It's a mini-movie about DMX's rise to super-stardom and his
        constant fight with evil. Co-stars Mary J. Blige. View "Angel" once and
        then forget about it... the rest of the DVD is what makes it a
        must-have. "Tales of X" is a look into the life and times of DMX. You
        can finally hear him, understand him and enter his world. "One More Road
        to Cross" documents step-by-step how X and his team lay down an album in
        the studio and the creative and emotional intensity surrounding the
        process. A full taste of DMX in front of a hometown audience is given by
        "Survival of the Illest" shot during his legendary 1999 performance at
        the Apollo Theater.</image:caption
