        >The story of Charlie is about Cheluvanarayana Swamy, an orphan who
        rechristens himself as Charlie and does odd jobs. He is on an assignment
        to Hampi where he meets Gayathri (Vaishali Deepak) who is inhumanely
        treated by her father. Charlie, who falls in love with her, rescues and
        brings her to Bengaluru. While he makes up his mind to settle with her,
        Gayathri joins a college, where she meets Rishi and falls in love him.
        Charlie is devastated on knowing their relationship. Meanwhile, Purvi
        (Milana Nagaraj) who studies in the same college falls in love with
        Charlie. The twisted love affairs get even more twisted when Gayathri
        reveals that she is pregnant and soon after Rishi is killed by some
        miscreants. What is Gayathri’s fate and does Charlie accept Purvi’s love
        is the crux of the film,</image:caption
