        >A series of "vampire" style murders on campus has Sarah scared of her
        own shadow - It doesn't help that her new dorm mate Lilith wears only
        gothic clothing, is afraid of crosses, avoids daylight and resembles a
        member of the undead. Sarah becomes convinced that Lilith has something
        to do with the horrendous murders. When Sarah can't convince others of
        her outlandish theory...she becomes the next target.</image:caption
