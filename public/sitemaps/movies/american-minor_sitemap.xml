        >Through carefully created, lingering scenes, the film focuses on the
        external environment and internal state of a fourteen-year-old,
        upper-middle-class blonde girl whose world is defined through products,
        objects, and perpetual consumption. The film observes a single,
        protracted morning in the life of a picture-perfect American youth lost
        in the dehumanizing space that wealth, isolation, and fear can provide.
        By watching this American teen perform basic acts, from eating cereal,
        to watching television, to combing her hair, the film aims to reveal the
        complicated relationship between personal pleasure and politics, youth
        and sexuality, and class and suppression. American Minor premiered in
        Nine Lives at the Hammer Museum in 2009, curated by Ali Subotnick, and
        then went on to be featured at the Sundance Film Festival and Directorâ€™s
        Fortnight in Cannes, both 2009.</image:caption
