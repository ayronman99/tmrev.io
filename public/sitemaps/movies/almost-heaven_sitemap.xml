        >A Canadian television director is hired to salvage an international
        fishing show in Scotland. The only hitch: his ex-wife is the host. What
        he finds in Scotland is love in the form of a local fishing guide
        (called a ghillie) and the chance to repair his life and his friendship
        with his ex-wife with whom he had a child who died.</image:caption
