        >Two teens on their way to a backwoods party come across a beautiful
        young woman having car trouble. Their search for help only gets them
        lost, deep in the woods, where they meet Forest Ranger Bill with a
        penchant for scary stories. The campfire flickers long into the night as
        the ranger uses words to weave his tapestry of terror, filling their
        young minds with a host of horrific images that will be burned into your
        consciousness long after the fire's last embers have gone out. Insane
        doctors, Indian ghosts, bad drugs, a deranged handyman with shiny new
        shears - all that and more awaits anyone brave enough to stay until
        sunrise... if you live that long! - Written by Schleppy</image:caption
