        >Umut has been a thief since he was a kid. He constantly seeks the
        opportunity of his life and his family. He can't find either. Gülüm is a
        young girl who has no problems in her life, who has completed her
        schooling on time and is only a step away from her dreams. But before
        she takes that step towards her dreams, she hangs and falls. It is
        understood that Gülüm has liver failure. She'll die if she doesn't have
        a liver transplant. The fate of Umut and Gülüm merge at this point. Umut
        found the opportunity he had waited for the rest of his life. But this
        opportunity drags Umut into very difficult situations, and finds itself
        in a position that risks the lives of all loved ones. For Umut to come
        out of this vortex, he has to make very serious decisions. And love is
        worth everything? Is this love?</image:caption
