        >Cameron is a nighttime courier with a heart of gold and a secret. Dusk
        to dawn, he makes deliveries all over the Los Angeles area. A skilled
        chef, he's saving for his own food truck, but he's too busy taking care
        of other people to put his own dreams first. When his next pickup turns
        out to be Jasmine, the attractive, headstrong daughter of a client, the
        ensuing sparks light up the night sky. Will this chance encounter be
        just another delivery, or will it change his life
        forever?</image:caption
