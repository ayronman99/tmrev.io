        >M. Harry Smilac is a down-on-his-luck music manager who is having a
        hard time attracting talent and booking gigs for his band, Kicks (The
        most recent of the gigs is a Dairy Queen opening!!). When making
        arrangements for a campaign fund-raiser, he mistakes Rick Roberts, a
        professional wrestler, for a musician and hires him. At that moment he
        becomes a wrestling manager and starts to book matches for him and his
        teammate Tonga Tom. The team is a success, and Harry decides to take his
        wrestlers and his band on a "Rock n' Wrestling" tour. The tour is a
        success, and Harry feels what it is like to be a winner
        again.</image:caption
