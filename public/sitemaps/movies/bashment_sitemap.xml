        >JJ is an aspiring MC exploding onto London's exciting outlaw urban
        music scene. He's got the skills, he's got the rhymes, and he's got the
        drive. But there's a problem — not only is JJ a white boy from the
        sticks — he's also gay. And gay — in the world of hip-hop and ragga —
        ain't good. So when JJ resolves to come onstage at the Urban Slam
        Finals, taking his boyfriend Orlando with him, he knows it's going to
        get a bit grimy... but when the couple falls foul of the Infamous
        ghetto-rap crew, the Ilford Illmanics and Orlando is beaten into a state
        of permanent brain-damage, all of their lives are changed forever in a
        way no one could have ever foreseen.</image:caption
