        >The Crater is a land of underdogs, indistinct space, constant noise.
        Rosario is a street vendor, a gitane of village fairs, who gives away
        soft toys to whoever draws a winning number. The war he has declared
        against his own destiny has the immature and indolent body of his
        thirteen-year-old daughter: Sharon is pretty and can sing, and in this
        hotbed of stopgaps and desperate living, sheâ€™s his weapon for survival.

        punishment.</image:caption
