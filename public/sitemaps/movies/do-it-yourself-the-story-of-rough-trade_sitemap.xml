        >The Rough Trade story begins more than thirty years ago on 20th
        February 1976. Britain was in the grip of an IRA bombing campaign; a
        future prime minister was beginning to make her mark on a middle England
        in which punk was yet to run amok; and a young Cambridge graduate called
        Geoff Travis opened a new shop at 202 Kensington Park Road, just off
        Ladbroke Grove in west London. The Rough Trade shop sold obscure and
        challenging records by bands like American art-rockers Pere Ubu,
        offering an alternative to the middle-of-the-road rock music that
        dominated the music business.</image:caption
