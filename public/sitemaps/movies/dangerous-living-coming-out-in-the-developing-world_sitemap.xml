        >A feature-length documentary that explores the immense changes that
        occurred for gays, lesbians and transgender people living in the Global
        South. In the last decade of the 20th Century, a new heightened
        visibility began spreading throughout the developing world and the
        battles between families, fundamentalist religions, and governments
        around sexual and gender identity had begun. But in the West, few people
        knew about this historic social upheaval, until 52 men on Cairo’s Queen
        Boat discothèque were arrested for crimes of debauchery. That explosive
        story focused attention to the lives and trials of gay people coming out
        in the developing world and the film chronicles those
        events.</image:caption
