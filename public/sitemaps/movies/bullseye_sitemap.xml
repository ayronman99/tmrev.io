        >Elliott, a thirteen year-old trying to navigate his own world and the
        world of his seventeen year-old brother, Nick, in the last summer before
        high school. As Nick drags Elliott into a world ruled by others'
        expectations, Elliott becomes witness to the personal integrity Nick
        sacrifices in the interest of social standing. When Nick's delicate
        illusion falls apart, both boys get a chance to confront their
        anxieties.</image:caption
