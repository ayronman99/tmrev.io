        >Caught between the past and the present, Sim√£o is an old man, dejected
        by time, pursued by an unfinished love that, since his youth, forever
        marked his life. Born into a humble family, the son of servants in a
        wealthy home, his reducing condition, imposed by the social standards of
        a backward mentality, raised barriers for him, like the overwhelming
        passion, which pushed him towards the affections of his only daughter.
        of his parents' employers, he could overcome. Wrapped in a dense and
        moving dramatic load, Canaviais is a poignant and provocative film,
        which challenges positions and opinions by addressing current and
        controversial themes, such as abortion and social stratification. Its
        history, more than defining paths, invites reflection and seeks to
        debate complex and wide-ranging issues.</image:caption
