        >Detached is a contemporary Scrooge tale set in the Hollywood Hills that
        follows Chadh Campbell, an unscrupulous mortgage broker, as he receives
        a stream of anonymous holiday greetings during Christmas Eve and Day. As
        Chadh searches for the perpetrator of this "festive" assault he must
        face the unfavorable reality of just how many people he's harmed during
        his life, forcing him to confront how emotionally detached from those
        around him he's become.</image:caption
