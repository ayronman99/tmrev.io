        >Before their eventual team-up with Scooby and the gang, bright and
        optimistic Daphne and whip-smart and analytical Velma are both
        mystery-solving teens who are best friends but have only met online -
        until now. Daphne has just transferred to Velma's school, Ridge Valley
        High, an incredible tech-savvy institute with all the latest gadgets
        provided by the school's benefactor, tech billionaire Tobias Bloom. And
        while competition is fierce among the students for a coveted internship
        at Bloom Innovative, Daphne and Velma dig beyond all the gadgets and
        tech to investigate what is causing some of the brightest students in
        school to disappear - only to emerge again in a zombie-fied
        state.</image:caption
