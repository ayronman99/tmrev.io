        >Deserter follows Ryan Johnson and his wife Jen during their flight from
        the Central Valley of California to Toronto, Canada. Johnson deserted
        the American army after hearing that he was going to be deployed to
        Iraq, despite assurances that this would not happen. Like many of his
        contemporaries, Johnson only joined the army because he could not find a
        job, and he sees the war in Iraq as both illegal and immoral. Desertion
        means imprisonment, so he decides to flee, realising that there will be
        no way back. Johnson seeks advice from various helpful organisations
        that guide him and Jen to Canada. The employees include both Vietnam
        veterans and young soldiers who have already served in
        Iraq.</image:caption
