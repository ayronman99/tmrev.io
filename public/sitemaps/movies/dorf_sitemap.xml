        >A woman from a big city moves to a small village near the former border
        zone between East and West Germany. What is she looking for? What will
        she encounter? Rural life in the era of globa­li­sa­tion turns into an
        adven­ture. History lives in objects, stories and customs here since it
        was first recorded 800 years ago. Wars and famines have left their
        traces, just as churches, poli­tical parties and various forms of
        govern­ment. The change of the times, struc­tured by tele­vi­sion, has
        almost obscu­rely changed the old rhythms of life; super­market offers
        changed eating habits and food stock economy. Is it folk­lore nost­algia
        or a matter of preser­ving one’s way and quality of life to keep the old
        customs and habits, such as preser­ving old types of plants and boiling
        down cucum­bers? The village - a mutual exch­ange of expe­ri­ences and
        garden products. The village is like an onion: it shows ever new
        surpri­sing layers and leads us deep into unwritten
        pasts.</image:caption
