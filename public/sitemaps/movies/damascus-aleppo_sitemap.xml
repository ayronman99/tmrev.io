        >Syria, spring of 2018. Issa Abdallah, a famous radio broadcaster in the
        past, lives in loneliness after losing most of his beloved ones. With
        the liberation of Aleppo, Issa decides to visit his daughter Dina, who
        lives there with her two kids. The road from Damascus to Aleppo is a
        journey into the depth of life and people whom Issa meets, mirroring the
        Syrian reality with all its tragic and sarcastic contradictions. A
        journey that shows best values of love, compassion and the ability of
        confrontation that people have.</image:caption
