        >In 1609, William Shakespeare published a collection of 154 sonnets,
        creating what is arguably the greatest lyric sequence in English
        literature - and at the center of this masterpiece lies a mystery that
        has endured for centuries. What are the identities of “the young man”
        and “the dark lady” to whom all but two of the sonnets allude? This
        moving performance brings to life the gritty reality of Shakespeare’s
        England, bits of the Bard’s plays and poems, and the consummate poet and
        dramatist himself as it exposes these personages unseen but so keenly
        felt in Shakespeare’s sonnets and in his life. Rupert Graves, Tom
        Sturridge, Indira Varma, Anna Chancellor, and Zoë Wanamaker star.
        Contains mature themes and explicit language. Some content may be
