        >Brooke, a young marketing executive, goes back to her hometown excited
        to relive her Christmas memories, while helping a struggling
        family-owned winery. Her marketing assignment involves an unlikely
        partnership with Tyler, the charismatic, yet stubborn owner of the
        winery. Brooke quickly learns that the townâ€™s Christmas spirit has
        disappeared due to a wine conglomerate buying out all of the local
        wineries. Determined to bring Christmas back to the town, Brooke and
        Tyler work together and discover they share more than a love for
        wine.</image:caption
