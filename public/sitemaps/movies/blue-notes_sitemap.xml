        >A multi-layered narrative drama about ordinary people and their
        struggles and joys with life. Blue Notes is composed of five tales about
        people who are "blue": a married man struggles by with depression; his
        son spends his days drifting; a young woman reacts to being abused by
        her partner; a heroin addict attempts to start a career in music; and a
        lonely man, bereft of family, looks for a way to connect with
        others.</image:caption
