        such, a portion of image off screen to the right is reproduced as sound.
        It is a composition, an arrangement, but not one that is from seeing to
        hearing, or the other way around, but a composition for both of these

        thought experiment by Emil du Bois-Reymond, wherein he postulated that,
        if one were to cross the nerves of the eye and the ear where they enter
        the brain, the eye would hear lightning as a loud boom breaking the
        silence of the night and the ear would see thunder as a bright flash of
        light in the darkness.</image:caption
