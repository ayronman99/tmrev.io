        >Sari, a 17-year-old Balinese girl, is the daughter of a famous painter.
        In charge of her father's gallery, she is also expected to continue
        preserving the traditional values. But secretly, Sari wants to become a
        disc jockey (DJ), knowing that her father would oppose it. Sari's father
        is preoccupied with his own problem, fearing that his new work would not
        match his previous ones. Then Sari meets Daniel, a musician from
        Jakarta. Her father opposes their relationship especially after finding
        out that Sari has been secretly learning to DJ.</image:caption
