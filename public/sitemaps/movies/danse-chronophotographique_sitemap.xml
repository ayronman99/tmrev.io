        >We knew in which direction to go and more or less where to arrive,
        although our itinerary would have undoubtedly had to vary according to
        the conditions at the time of the trip. We knew what time to leave. We
        knew that on this line, by definition of infinite dimension, there was a
        meaning to be found. We knew who to call on in case of need
        (Etienne-Jules Marey, Marcel Duchamp, Loïe Füller). The rest did not yet
        exist. A line serves as the basis for weaving a complex and unexpected
        relationship between film and dance, or between film and skin; between
        the body of the film, the essence of the movement and the sound
        environment it creates or which creates it; between magnetic field,
        sweat and ether technology. In search of today's magic, these
        trajectories are presented as tests between the chemical and the
        chimerical, full of abstraction but above all concretely present in the
        moment of their construction.</image:caption
