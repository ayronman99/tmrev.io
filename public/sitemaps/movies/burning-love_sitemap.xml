        >July 2006. Leonardo Zuliani has vanished. The news from Trastevere in
        Rome turns into a real national emergency, while a huge throng of
        followers gathers around the young activist’s house. His mother is
        beside herself with grief and the entire neighbourhood is paralysed.
        He’s on every TV channel and the authorities all express their
        solidarity with the family. Many can’t believe it’s true; they prefer to
        think it’s just one of his stunts. A genius in conveying his ideas,
        successful cartoonist, visionary fashion designer, cult author, human
        rights activist: but who is Leonardo deep down? With the help of leading
        experts and celebrities, the film traces his life, at last casting light
        on a key figure of our times</image:caption
