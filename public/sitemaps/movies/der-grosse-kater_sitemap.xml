        >The Swiss President, called by all only "big hangover", is in trouble:
        the election is coming and according to surveys his chances are not very
        good. From a meeting with the Spanish royal couple, he hopes media
        attention and a popularity boost. He does not suspect that his closest
        confidant Pfiff, of all people, is intriguing against him in order to
        come to power himself. But he does not even shy away from misusing his
        family for his own purposes. Soon, the president has to fight not only
        for his political position, but also for his marriage.</image:caption
