        >In November 2004, Yasser Arafat died. He had been leader of the PLO
        since 1969 and president of the Palestinian Authority since 1993. His
        younger brother, Dr Fathi Arafat, died soon after of cancer. Driven by
        despondency about the endless violence and the continuing uncertainty
        about the future of his people, the well-known Palestinian film maker
        Rashid Masharawi started working on a documentary 18 months earlier, in
        which he follows Dr Fathi Arafat and travels from Cairo to Paris, via
        Ramallah and Lebanon, tackling endless closed borders and
        roadblocks.</image:caption
