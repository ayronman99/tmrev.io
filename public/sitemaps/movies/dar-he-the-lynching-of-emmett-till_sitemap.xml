        >There have been numerous treatments, in various media, of the horrific
        1955 murder in Money, Mississippi, of 14-year-old Chicagoan Emmett Till,
        but none like this concise, stunning dramatization in which actor-writer
        Mike Wiley plays all 36 roles--black, white, male, female, young, and
        old. What might sound like a distracting stunt is in fact the film’s
        distinctive strength. Relying on subtleties of acting rather than heavy
        makeup, with seamless digital compositing in multi-character scenes,
        Wiley’s tour de force defamiliarizes the material with startling
        effectiveness and compels us to get under the skins of all the major
        players in the tragic events. (Gene Siskel Film Center)</image:caption
