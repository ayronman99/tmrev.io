        >Lifelong friends Kate, Evie and Charlie are in a rut. Kate spends her
        days at a middling job and her nights alone or on failed dates. Evie is
        married with the in-laws from hell, wandering from one charitable cause
        to the next. Charlie has the girl of her dreams but just can’t seem to
        pull her business (or her act) together. On the eve of Kate’s 30th
        birthday, she agrees to let Evie and Charlie throw her a party. But
        what’s supposed to be a simple celebration becomes a wild who’s who of
        past and present, and things quickly spiral out of
        control.</image:caption
