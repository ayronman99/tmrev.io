        >Felix is on the edge. He has got just one thing on his mind: Valerie -
        his wife, who has recently left him. He returns to the place of their
        final break-up. Valerie's ex-lover Thomas is also here, but not for
        sentimental reasons. By chance the two men meet in a restaurant. By
        chance Felix discovers who he is facing. And then starts the inscrutable
        game.</image:caption
