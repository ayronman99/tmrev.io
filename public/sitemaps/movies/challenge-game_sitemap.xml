        >Florist Ae-ran and forensics investigator Min-ho from the Public
        Prosecutor's Office both have a family that everyone wants. However,
        Min-ho can't handle bed time so Ae-ran starts a 'challenge game' in
        which she seduces and has sex with strange men. One day, Ae-ran and
        Min-ho meet Alex at a tango cafe. Alex is interested in Ae-ran and
        approaches her while Ae-ran takes interest in Alex who is more handsome
        than her husband. Min-ho later witnesses them in action and gets angry
        when he finds out the man Ae-ran seduced is Alex. Min-ho feels nervous
        because he finds out Alex isn't just a game partner and approached him
        for a reason. Min-ho tries to get rid of Alex but Alex chokes Ae-ran and
        Min-ho even more and feels catharsis. The game they started is turning
        into a catastrophe...</image:caption
