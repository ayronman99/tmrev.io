        >A coming of age romantic comedy centered around the lives of twin
        brothers Luke and Corey Frankenstein in the pivotal months following
        college graduation. Orphaned at the age of five, the brothers inherited
        their family brewery and were left in the care of their uncle, a
        well-meaning but less than ideal paternal figure. Raised on beer, with
        the assumption they're all grown up, Luke and Corey decide it's time to
        finish their family beer; a beer their parents started but were never
        able to finish twenty years ago. But when the idealistic Luke meets a
        girl whose family shows him the home life he's always wanted, he
        abandons Corey and their family beer in pursuit of this budding
        relationship. Corey, however, refuses to go down without a fight, and
        the ensuing mayhem that follows pits brother against brother and forces
        the Colorado wild boys to finally grow up and decide what kind of men
        they really want to be.</image:caption
