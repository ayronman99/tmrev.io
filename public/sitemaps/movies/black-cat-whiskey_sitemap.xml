        >In a small rural town hit hard by the Depression, Katie Connors resides
        in a middle-class home with her bootlegging husband Melvin. When the
        opportunity arises to bump him off without getting her hands dirty, she
        takes a chance she may never get again. After his murder at the hands of
        criminal Richard Hayden, she begins to receive inopportune visits by
        Melvin's old business partners about a large shipment of moonshine in
        her possession. Contacting the FBI for help, agent Ron Sheridan is
        assigned to her case and develops an unrequited love for Katie. But when
        a full-scale war develops, she learns the FBI may not be much help to
        her as she thought, and Katie must take matters into her own hands to
        pay off her husband's debts for good.</image:caption
