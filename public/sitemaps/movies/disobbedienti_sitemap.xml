        >The Disobbedienti emerged from the Tute Bianche during the
        demonstrations against the G8 summit in Genoa in July 2001. The “Tute
        Bianche” were the white-clad Italian activists who used their bodies –
        protected by foam rubber, tires, helmets, gas masks, and homemade
        shields – in direct acts and demonstrations as weapons of civil
        disobedience. The Tute Bianche first appeared in Italy in 1994 in the
        midst of a social setting in which the “mass laborer,” who had played a
        central role in the 1970s in production and in labor struggles, was
        gradually replaced in the transition to precarious post-Fordist means of
        production. “Disobbedienti” thematizes the Disobbedienti’s origins,
        political bases, and forms of direct action on the basis of
        conversations with seven members of the movement.</image:caption
