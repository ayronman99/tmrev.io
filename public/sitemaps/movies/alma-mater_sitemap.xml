        >34-year-old Pamela is a small and shy woman. She works at the cash
        register of a supermarket. She attends a religious temple led by a
        Brazilian minister. She periodically visits her autistic mother. She is
        an anonymous character, leading a meaningless life. Suddenly, a miracle
        occurs. Messages of a marvelous destiny start to reach Pamela in unusual
        ways: a client, a gentle and charismatic transvestite, her own mother,
        dreams, bar codes, real and imaginary signals. The Savior of the Next
        Millennium is apparently on his way and everything indicates that she,
        being a virgin, is carrying him on her entrails. Impelled to face
        herself, Pamela undertakes an inner voyage. A paradoxical voyage: the
        more mystic she grows to be, the more human she becomes.</image:caption
