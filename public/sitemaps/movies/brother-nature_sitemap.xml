        >Roger, a straight-laced politician has big plans to propose to his
        dream girl at her family's lake house. But everything goes awry when he
        meets his potential brother-in-law Todd: a full-time camp counselor with
        a heart of gold and a wild sense of fun, pining to be Roger's best
        friend, and ultimately catapulting him into a series of unfortunate
        events. As Roger tries to take a stand amidst outrageous fishing
        excursions, propulsive water jetpacks and American history-themed
        musicals, he realizes that being a part of a new family may be more
        difficult than he'd thought.</image:caption
