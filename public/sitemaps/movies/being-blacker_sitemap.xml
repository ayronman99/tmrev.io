        >After a ten year absence, acclaimed filmmaker Molly Dineen is back with
        a new feature documentary: Being Blacker; an intimate portrait of
        Jamaican-born reggae producer, businessman, father, son and prominent
        community figure, Blacker Dread. 40 years after featuring in Dineen’s
        first film, Blacker and his family, friends and community in South
        London face the combined challenges of rapid social change,
        gentrification, inequality, poverty, crime and racism as they seek to
        secure their futures. Made with intimacy and warmth, the film takes us
        deep into Blacker’s world as he buries his mother, closes his business
        and faces prison for the first time. Being Blacker offers a rarely-heard
        perspective on life in Britain today.</image:caption
