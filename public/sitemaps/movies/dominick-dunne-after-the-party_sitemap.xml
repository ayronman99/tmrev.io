        >Vanity Fair Special Correspondent Dominick Dunne has become known the
        world over for his vociferous championing of the rights of the victim in
        high-profile murder cases. His powerful commentaries have made
        compelling reading in Vanity Fair for a quarter of a century. Now, aged
        82, Dunne is covering his last murder trial for Vanity Fair -- the trial
        of music producer Phil Spector -- and reflects upon his past as a
        decorated WWII Veteran, his rise and spectacular collapse as a Hollywood
        producer, and his rebirth as the writer we know today. Dunne's mind
        offers a fascinating insight into the American psyche and its obsession
        with fame.</image:caption
