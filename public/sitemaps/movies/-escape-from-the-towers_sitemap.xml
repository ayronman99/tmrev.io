        >Each World Trade Center tower consisted of 110 floors. Each floor has a
        story. In this two-hour special, survivors from two of those floors,
        many speaking publicly for the first time, tell their stories. Focusing
        on one floor in the North Tower and one in the South, this film will
        provide a never-before-achieved intimacy with what it was really like to
        be inside the Twin Towers on 9/11.</image:caption
