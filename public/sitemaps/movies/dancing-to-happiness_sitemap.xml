        >Anna is working as a cleaning lady. Every night she cleans Helen's
        office. Helen is a high level broker working in the stock exchange. The
        two women live in different worlds and normally would never meet each
        other. However they happen to have enrolled on the same salsa course.
        Due to the lack of men, Anna and Helen have to dance together. A lesbian
        fairytale depicting the possibility of overcoming social
        borders.</image:caption
