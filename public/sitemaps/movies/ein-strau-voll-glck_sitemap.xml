        >After the death of her husband, Anna tries to begin a new life with her
        children Paul and Laura on the North-Sea island Amrum. An ostrich-farm
        is the smart business-idea, which secures her family's future. As
        merchandising and to inspire her prospective customers for her products,
        she sends ostrich-eggs to the nearby restaurants on the mainland. But
        the first delivery turns into to a disaster. The shipping company that
        operates the ferry service to the mainland had left Anna's products in
        the sun too long, and all eggs spoiled before they got to their
        destination. Anna's optimism gets a serious blow and she is close to
        bankruptcy. Matthias, a lawyer and a good friend of Anna, supports her
        by all means in her fight against the shipping company owner and
        shyster, Reents. With great media interest and the aid of the
        sympathetic journalist, Marc stokes, Anna enters the fight against the
        nearly all-powerful adversary in order to force Reents to give
        up.</image:caption
