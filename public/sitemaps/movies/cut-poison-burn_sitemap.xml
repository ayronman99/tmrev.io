        >The Film tells the grim tale of the half century War on Cancer and
        focuses on the character of Thomas Navarro. In 1999, the four year old
        boy was diagnosed with brain cancer and thrust into the system of
        Surgery, Chemo and Radiation and not allowed to be treated with a proven
        method by Texas Doctor Stanislaw Burzynski. The war between the Navarro
        Family and the FDA is perhaps this country's greatest evidence as to why
        there should be medical freedom and how since the War on Cancer began in
        1971, the war is still failing in 2009.</image:caption
