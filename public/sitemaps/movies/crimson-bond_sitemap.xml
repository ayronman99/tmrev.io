        >Crimson Bond is a 70-minute movie produced by Jas Townsend & Son in
        2011. It is an endearing story about two friends, Jon and Josh (played
        by Jas. Townsend & Sonâ€™s very own Jon Townsend and Joshua King), who
        unwittingly serve in the Continental Army in the Ohio wilderness under
        the command of a tyrannical commander. Jon is begrudgingly bound to Josh
        by a childhood promise to keep Josh safe from the trouble that seems to
        hound him at every turn. The tension between this promise and self
        preservation finally reaches a breaking point as the two find themselves
        falling deeper into danger. Crimson Bond is a fictional tale, not a
        documentary. Its theme of friendship, loyalty, and redemption, combined
        with a bit of lighthearted humor in the midst of darker circumstances,
        is intended to entertain the entire family.</image:caption
