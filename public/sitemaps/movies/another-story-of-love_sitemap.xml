        >Diego is a twenty-year-old Chilean boy who spends every day taking
        pictures of anything he sees. After many years he meets Sebastian, his
        childhood friend, and they spend a whole summer together drinking
        alcohol, smoking marijuana and walking around in the blazing sun of
        Santiago. They both come from dysfunctional families (Diego's mother is
        an alcoholic and Sebastian feels abandoned by his father and his
        stepmother), but the need to discover the world around them and explore
        their inner feelings brings them closer to each other, making their
        friendship very, very intense. The desire that ties them to each other
        is palpable, and soon barriers and fears fall, leading them to wonder
        what they really want.</image:caption
