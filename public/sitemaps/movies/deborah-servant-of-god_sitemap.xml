        >Documentary about 13-year-old Deborah Drapper, who, unlike other
        British teens has never heard of Britney Spears or Victoria Beckham. She
        has been brought up in a deeply Christian family and her parents have
        tried to make sure she and her ten brothers and sisters have grown up
        protected from the sins of the outside world. Deborah is a bright,
        confident girl who has big ambitions for her life and the film spends a
        summer with her as she ventures out in the world to see what life
        outside her family could be and starts putting her beliefs forward to a
        wider audience.</image:caption
