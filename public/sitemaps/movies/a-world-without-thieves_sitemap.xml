        >Two grifters, Wang Bo and Wang Li, a couple who've been arguing, board
        a train in rural China. He wants to fleece a peasant, nicknamed Dumbo
        for his naivet√©, who's carrying 60,000 yuan and trusts everyone. She
        wants to protect the hick kid, an act of expiation brought on by prayer
        and a visit to a temple. Also on board are one of more sets of thieves,
        including a calculating boss and his femme fatale. The boss wants to
        recruit Wang Bo, and a series of contests ensue, with the potential of
        turning deadly. While Li guards Dumbo from Bo and the others, can she
        and Bo sort out their relationship? And can Dumbo's simple spirituality
        touch anyone else?</image:caption
