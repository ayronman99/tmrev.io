        >On his 62nd birthday, confirmed lazybones Herbopolus grabs his nest egg
        and buys himself a new trailer, a fine 5th Wheel. Now all he has to do
        is sit back and wait for the Social Security checks to start rolling in.
        In the meantime, his insane brother Bananas Foster escapes from the
        Catalina Mental Institution and, looking for a place to hole up, gets
        Herbopolus to let him stay in his swanky new digs. So does their dad, a
        sex change octogenarian who's lesbian lover has kicked him out of the
        house. When the government fails to come through, they resort to
        collecting and recycling aluminum cans to make ends meet.</image:caption
