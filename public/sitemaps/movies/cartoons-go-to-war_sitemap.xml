        >This remarkable documentary dedicates itself to an extraordinary
        chapter of the second World War – the psychological warfare of the USA.
        America’s trusted cartoon darlings from the studios of Warner Bros.,
        Paramount, and the “big animals” of the Disney family were supposed to
        give courage to the people at the homefront, to educate them, but also
        to simultaneously entertain them. Out of this mixture grew a genre of
        its own kind – political cartoons. Insightful Interviews with the
        animators and producers from back then elucidate in an amusing and
        astonishing way under which bizarre circumstances these films partially
        came into existence.</image:caption
