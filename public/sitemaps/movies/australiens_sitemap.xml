        >At the age of 10, Australian-born Andi Gibson had what she describes as
        a close encounter with a flying saucer. Naturally, everyone assumed she
        was bonkers. That is until one notable evening, 17 years later, when an
        airborne extra-terrestrial armada launches a nation-wide assault on
        Andi's home country and at the same time, for unspecified reasons,
        kidnaps her mother. To add to the debacle, it seems the other nations of
        the world are far too insulted by their exclusion from the attack to
        come to Australia's aid. Now it is up to Andi, her hypochondriac brother
        Elliot, retired boxer cousin Keith and documentary filmmaker friend Cam
        to stop the attack and rescue Andi's mum. Enlisting the help of Andi's
        equal-parts mysterious and cringeworthy father, the gang must battle
        car-chasing spaceships, martial-arts aliens, giant killer robots and,
        perhaps most frighteningly, a deluge of family secrets in their fight to
        save Australia. Bloody hell, this is gonna be a long
        night</image:caption
