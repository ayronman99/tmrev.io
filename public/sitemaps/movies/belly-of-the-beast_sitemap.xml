        >When a courageous young woman and a radical lawyer discover a pattern
        of illegal involuntary sterilizations in California’s women’s prison
        system, they take to the courtroom to wage a near-impossible battle
        against the Department of Corrections. With a growing team of
        investigators inside prison working with colleagues on the outside, they
        uncover a series of statewide crimes - from dangerously inadequate
        health care to sexual assault to coercive sterilizations - primarily
        targeting women of color. But no one believes them. This shocking legal
        drama captured over seven years features extraordinary access and
        intimate accounts from currently and formerly incarcerated women,
        demanding our attention to a shameful and ongoing legacy of eugenics and
        reproductive injustice in the United States.</image:caption
