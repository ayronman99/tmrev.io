        >Adolescence is always a difficult time; it is doubly so for Gábina. For
        one thing, she is growing up in the normalization years of the 1970s,
        and then she also has to face the reality that her father is a
        well-known actor disavowed by the regime. Although he abandoned the
        family years before, his existence casts an ominous shadow over the
        lives of not only Gábina, but also her older sister and mother, who are
        trying to find a civilized way through the social mire of the
        times.</image:caption
