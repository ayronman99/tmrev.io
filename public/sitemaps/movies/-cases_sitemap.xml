        >Two retired bank robbers agree to one last job. A face from their past
        steals their proceeds and divides the cash into 7 Cases.... each one is
        left with someone they know. If they take a case, the victim dies... if
        they don't get there in time... the victim dies.... if they tamper with
        the traps...they all die... Their day goes from bad to worse as they
        encounter all the faces from their past and have to make some
        heartbreaking decisions.</image:caption
