        >When Idaho Legislator Curtis Bowers wrote a "letter to the editor"
        about the drastic changes in America's culture, it became the feature
        story on the evening news, people protested at the Capitol, and for
        weeks the local newspapers were filled with responses. He realized
        then... he'd hit on something. Ask almost anyone and you'll hear,
        "Communism is dead! The Berlin Wall came down." Thought the word
        communism isn't used anymore, this film will show the ideas behind it
        are alive and well. Join Bowers for a fascinating look at the people and
        groups that have successfully targeted America's morality and freedom in
        their effort to grind America down. It's a well documented
        AGENDA.</image:caption
