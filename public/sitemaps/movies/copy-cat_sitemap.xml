        >Newly promoted Lieutenant Valentine Ventura finds herself working with
        famous Captain Antoine Thomas who just came back from his medical leave
        after the tragedy he lived a few months ago : victim of a car crash that
        killed both his wife and the child she was bearing, Antoine Thomas spent
        several months in the hospital, and is now back in a wheelchair after
        losing function of his legs. Working on the case of a murdered young
        journalist, the two detectives succeed in arresting her colleague, whose
        guilt is undeniable. Multiple elements even indicate that they just
        caught a serial killer; although he admits he killed the young
        journalist, their suspect didn't commit these other murders, and seems
        to be the victim of a manipulation.</image:caption
