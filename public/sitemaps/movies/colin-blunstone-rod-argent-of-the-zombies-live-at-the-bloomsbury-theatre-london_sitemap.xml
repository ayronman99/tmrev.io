        >Back together onstage for the first time in over 30 years, Colin
        Blunstone and Rod Argent, the driving force behind the legendary 1960s
        beat group The Zombies, perform live at the Bloomsbury Theatre in
        London. Backed by a string quartet on some songs, this very special
        concert features The Zombies' international classic hits from the 1960s
        including "She's Not There" and "Time of the Season", as well as new
        songs from their album release "As Far As I Can See". A thrilling
        concert from one of the most revered bands of all time.</image:caption
