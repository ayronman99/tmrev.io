        >A ne'er do well father and ex-husband who always raced his way through
        the holidays is forced to relive Christmas Day time and again until he
        gets it right in this family oriented fantasy comedy starring Jay Mohr.
        It's Christmas time once again, and as usual Kevin (Moore) is scrambling
        to get his son Ben a last minute gift before stopping by his ex-wife
        Jill's house for a quick swig of eggnog. Ben can't stand Jill's
        impossibly perfect new boyfriend, and the prospect of spending the
        entire evening with his former inlaws is nearly too painful to ponder.
        But this Christmas things are going to be different, because this
        Christmas might just last forever. At first Kevin resists the curious
        development by simply reverting to his childish ways, though he is about
        to find out that sometimes in order to build a better future one must
        finally make amends with the past. ~ Jason Buchanan</image:caption
