        >In a typical American suburb filled with middle class morals, a lonely
        59-year-old, Stan, contributes to society by offering cremation services
        from his basement. In fact, Stan murders neighbors he perceives to be
        social bullies. Jarod, a fatherless 17-year-old high school outcast,
        lands an after-school job in Stan's cremation house and the two develop
        an unusual working relationship that quickly evolves into a partnership.
        As detective Matt Fairchild puts together clues from local
        disappearances, Stan must decide if protecting his newfound trainee is
        worth killing for.</image:caption
