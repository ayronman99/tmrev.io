        >In the beautiful hills of the Copper Canyon in Chihuahua, Mexico, a
        young boy (Emilio) is adopted by the mailman (Teo). As part of their
        daily tasks, they not only deliver the mail but read letters to the
        villagers, as well as take dictation, since most are illiterate. Young
        Emilio quickly learns to read and write but feels saddened by the mostly
        difficult stories sent by relatives, that moved north to Denver,
        Colorado in pursuit of a better future. One day Teo becomes disabled and
        Emilio takes over the mail route and with great imagination, he changes
        the letters to happy and optimistic stories. Within days, the village is
        transformed. The elders, once hopeless, lonely and sad, are now happy
        and enthusiastic, enjoying the "supposed" success their loved ones write
        from the United States. But the enjoyment is short lived, as they
        realize that all the wonderful stories are the same...</image:caption
