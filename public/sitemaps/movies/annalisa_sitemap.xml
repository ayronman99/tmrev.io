        >The friendship between two Southern Italy kids is tested by their
        meeting with a young girl who's attempted suicide after failing to get
        married. Based on the novel "Il paese delle spose infelici" (literally,
        "Village of the Sad Brides", which is also the original title of this
        film) this elegantly photographed coming-of-age tale has sensitivity to
        spare but its stylish, yet understated, attitude doesn't easily win
        viewers over.</image:caption
