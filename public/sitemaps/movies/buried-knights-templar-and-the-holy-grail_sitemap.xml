        >Mikey Kay and Garth Baldwin investigate the Knights Templar's
        underground movements to discover if they escaped being destroyed in
        1307, and most importantly if they took the Holy Grail with them.
        Searching through the middle east, they attempt to uncover modern

        been hidden for hundreds of years.</image:caption
