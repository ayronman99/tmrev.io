        >Dear Pyongyang is a documentary film by Zainichi Korean director Yang
        Yong-hi (Korean: 양영희, Hanja: 梁英姬) about her own family. It was
        shot in Osaka Japan (Yang's hometown) and Pyongyang, North Korea, In the
        1970s, Yang's father, an ardent communist and leader of the pro-North
        movement in Japan, sent his three sons from Japan to North Korea under a
        repatriation campaign sponsored by ethnic activist organisation and de
        facto North Korean embassy Chongryon; as the only daughter, Yang herself
        remained in Japan. However, as the economic situation in the North
        deteriorated, the brothers became increasingly dependent for survival on
        the care packages sent by their parents. The film shows Yang's visits to
        her brothers in Pyongyang, as well as conversations with her father
        about his ideological faith and his regrets over breaking up his
        family.</image:caption
