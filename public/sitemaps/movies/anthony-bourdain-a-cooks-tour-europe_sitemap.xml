        >Cooking and dining with Anthony Bourdain! Europe - 6 episodes Arachon,
        France, the birthplace of Tony's father, was the first place Tony
        learned to love food. Tony revisits his childhood and enjoys many
        staples, including steak frites, gaufres (waffles), and soupe de pecheur
        (fisherman's soup). Other episodes include A Pleasing Palate (London)
        and Highland Grub (Scotland). The #1 food writer and television
        presenter in the world, Anthony Bourdain reinvented the food travel
        genre. In his groundbreaking first series, that originally aired on the
        Food Network, Bourdain travels around the world indulging his taste for
        local cuisine and eccentric characters. Join Tony as he feasts on sushi
        in Tokyo, enjoys authentic Mexican cuisine, and traverses the Australian
        Outback on a memorable food journey. You never know what he'll say, who
        he'll meet, or what they'll have for dinner.</image:caption
