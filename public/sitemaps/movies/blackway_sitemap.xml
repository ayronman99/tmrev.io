        >A young woman newly returned to her hometown becomes the subject of
        harassment by a man named Blackway, an ex-cop turned violent crime lord
        who operates with impunity in this small community on the edge of the
        wilderness. Forsaken by the local townspeople—and advised by the Sheriff
        to leave town—Lillian decides instead to take a stand against her
        sociopathic stalker, and enlists the help of ex-logger Lester and his
        laconic young sidekick.</image:caption
