        >Mafia boss Rocky Basta is a man of vast ambition who rules his dark
        empire with an iron fist. He plans to consolidate his power with that of
        his enemies to form a new world order. Instead of constantly going to
        war Rocky proposes a gladiatorial forum in which power is earned;
        respect won or lost, and disputes are resolved;..until death. "Gentlemen
        we have always lived by the sword, might is right. I propose that we set
        up a game to the death. A game of real power and strength. A game that
        centuries ago decided the fate of nations..." It's the fascinating story
        of a man, who has a vision to unify the Underworld. His past sins
        torment his very being. Guardians of the 'game', protectors from ancient
        times, offer their guidance, yet their motives are unknown. Rocky is put
        to the test facing a past love, a troubled daughter he never knew, the
        dark underworld syndicates challenging his power, and the onus that it
        exacts. And this is only the beginning</image:caption
