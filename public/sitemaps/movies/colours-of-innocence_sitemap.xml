        >10-year-old Gopal's carefree childhood is disrupted when his father
        meets with an accident. It becomes difficult for his mother to feed him
        and his little brother Chottu. Gopal starts devising ways to earn money.
        With a little assistance from Chottu he takes up odd jobs from cleaning
        wells to selling laboriously plucked fruits in the local village market.
        Emboldened by his initial success, Gopal fancies himself as the
        breadwinner of the family. Meanwhile a grand Janmashtami feast is being
        planned in the Brahmin household where the pulao will be served. Hearing
        this both the brothers hatch plans of their own. Gopal would like to
        make a quick buck by selling palmyras for the feast, while Chottu starts
        dreaming of this fancy dish that he has never seen or tasted. After all
        he has heard that the whole village will be invited.</image:caption
