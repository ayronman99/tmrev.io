        >Post-September 11, 2001, Zaid Ahmed Khan lives a wealthy lifestyle in
        Mumbai and resides in an apartment at Shanti Kutir, Juhu Tara Road,
        Mumbai, and works as an Assistant Commissioner of Police. One day
        terrorists strike at a club, killing 20 people, &amp; critically
        injuring several others. The Police are put on alert, and Zaid is
        summoned to Police Headquarters to identify a body. To his shock the
        body turns out to be that of Sarha, his wife - who was not a victim but
        was a suicide-bomber. While trying to put his life together, Zaid comes
        across evidence that Sarha may have had an hand in the killings, and
        thus intrigued he decides to travel to Nasik to find out what really
        happened, whether his devout Islamic wife was really a terrorist or the
        victim of a deep-rooted conspiracy.</image:caption
