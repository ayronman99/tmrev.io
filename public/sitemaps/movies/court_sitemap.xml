        >A sewerage worker's dead body is found inside a manhole in Mumbai. An
        ageing folk singer is tried in court on charges of abetment of suicide.
        He is accused of performing an inflammatory song which might have
        incited the worker to commit the act. As the trial unfolds, the personal
        lives of the lawyers and the judge involved in the case are observed
        outside the court.</image:caption
