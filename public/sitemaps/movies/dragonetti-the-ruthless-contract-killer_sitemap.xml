        >Claudio Dragonetti is an Italian assassin, one of the best in the
        industry. He is hired by a local mafia boss in Gothenburg, Ivan. He
        needs Dragonettis services to get rid of the two competitors. The job is
        nothing special really. This is something that Claudio Dragonetti done
        many times before. But this time something goes wrong and he
        accidentally kills the wrong people. This is appreciated neither by the
        Mafia or the Swedish authorities and Dragonetti soon finds that he is
        driven from two directions. But Claudio Dragonetti has a trump card
        which none of his enemies know. He has signed a pact with Satan, a pact
        that makes him almost invulnerable, all he had to leave in return was
        his own immortal soul.</image:caption
