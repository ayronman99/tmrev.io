        >Simon Lindstr√∂m, the popular coach of a suburban junior hockey team is
        found stabbed to death. Does the murder have something to do with his
        side project: teaching unaccompanied refugee children to ice skate? This
        undertaking has certainly not been appreciated by everyone in their
        small, sheltered community. Martin Beck, who has returned in a more
        senior position, struggles to find a replacement for the temporary head
        of the group, Steinar Hovland. But the Norwegian is becoming more and
        more interested in keeping his new role. The question is whether Martin
        can trust him?</image:caption
