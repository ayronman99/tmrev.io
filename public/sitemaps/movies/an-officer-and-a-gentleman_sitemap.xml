        >Zack Mayo is an aloof, taciturn man who aspires to be a navy pilot.
        Once he arrives at training camp for his 13-week officer's course, Mayo
        runs afoul of abrasive, no-nonsense drill Sergeant Emil Foley. Mayo is
        an excellent cadet, but a little cold around the heart, so Foley rides
        him mercilessly, sensing that the young man would be prime officer
        material if he weren't so self-involved. Zack's affair with a working
        girl is likewise compromised by his unwillingness to give of
        himself.</image:caption
