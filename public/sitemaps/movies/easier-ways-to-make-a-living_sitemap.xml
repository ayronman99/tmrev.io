        >A billionaire heiress is brutally abducted and held for an impossible
        ransom. The police investigation at a dead end, it falls to Hennessey, a
        troubled private detective with a pathological disregard for his own
        safety, to find her. But, savagely attacked in his own office, Hennessey
        finds himself lying battered, bruised and watched over by his sinister
        assailant. How will he ever be able to save both the kidnap victim and
        himself by the midnight deadline?</image:caption
