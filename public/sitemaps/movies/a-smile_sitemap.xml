        >This debut feature from female Korean director Park Kyung-hee tells the
        story of a photographer whose life is changed indelibly when she
        discovers she has a rare disease which causes tunnel vision and possible
        eventual blindness. Divided into four sections, it depicts the break-up
        of her relationship with her boyfriend, her problems with her
        old-fashioned family, her attempts to deal with her disease through her
        art and, finally, her desire to fly an airplane before she loses her
        sight entirely.</image:caption
