        >Through the conversation with Yugoslav film authors and excerpts from
        their films, this documentary film tells a story of a film phenomenon
        and censorship, and its focus is, in fact, a painful epoch of Yugoslav
        film called “a Black Wave”, which was the most important and
        artistically strongest period of Yugoslav film industry, created in the
        sixties and buried in the early seventies by means of ideological and
        political decisions. The film tells a great “thriller” story of the
        ideological madness which characterised the totalitarian psychology
        having left multiple consequences felt up to our very days. It stresses
        similarities between totalitarian regimes defending their taboos on the
        example of the persecution of the most important Yugoslav film authors.
        Those film authors have, however, made world careers and inspired many
        later authors. The film is the beginning of a debt pay-off to the most
        significant Yugoslav film authors.</image:caption
