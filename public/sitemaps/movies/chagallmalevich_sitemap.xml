        >The film is an attempt to recreate the world of Marc Chagall and his
        myth within the genre of a folklore ballad. We are not exploiting
        Chagall's images, but are attempting to create a dramatized projection
        of his creativity onto the movie screen, relying on both, facts and
        fantasy (as Chagall himself would).The story is based on real events
        which occurred at the time of Chagall's short-lived period in Vitebskin
        in 1917-18, during which time he creates the Academy of Modern Art,
        inspired by his dreams of a bright and beautiful future. Many pictures
        by Chagall and Malevich are used in the film.</image:caption
