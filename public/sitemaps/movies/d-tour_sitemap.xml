        >Pat Spurgeon is a professional musician whose dreams of being in a
        successful rock 'n' roll band have come true. But just as his band,
        Rogue Wave, starts to take off, his kidney starts to fail. "D tour"

        with daily dialysis, a grueling tour, and a search for a new
        kidney.</image:caption
