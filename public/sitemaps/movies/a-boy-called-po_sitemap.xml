        >When David Wilson's young wife falls victim to cancer, he is left a
        single working dad with the sole responsibility of caring for his sixth
        grade son with autism. Patrick, who prefers to be called 'Po,' is a
        gifted but challenged child who was very close to his mother and unable
        to communicate his own sense of loss. As father and son struggle to deal
        with life after mom, they each begin to withdraw into their own worlds.
        David into the high pressure job he's close to losing and Po drifting
        away from the school where he's bullied into his magical fantasy world,
        the Land of Color, where he's just a typical carefree boy with a rich
        cast of other worldly companions. The growing divide between father and
        son and the challenges of single parenthood of a special needs child
        threaten to separate David and Po permanently. Based on a true story,
        the bonds of love between a grieving father and son are tested in the
        most real way in Po.</image:caption
