        >Armed With Faith follows the men of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Bomb
        Disposal Unit (KPK BDU) to the front lines of the war against Al-Qaeda
        and the Taliban in Pakistan. The lawless province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
        -- considered the gateway for terrorists from neighboring Afghanistan --
        is the backdrop of our film. The battle for control of this porous
        border area remains critical to the stability of Pakistan and global
        security. Should Pakistan, a nuclear power, fall into the hands of
        terrorists, the entire world is at risk. We witness firsthand the
        dangerous struggle undertaken by the men of the KPK BDU to protect their
        country against the Taliban threat in the land they both call
        home.</image:caption
