        >In a few years, technology will merge with our bodies in ways that
        today seem unimaginable, and will redefine the limits of what is a human
        being. There are already people who, driven by the desire to experiment,
        have crossed the biological limits by introducing electronic devices
        that provide them with capabilities that go beyond what is "normal."
        They are the first hybrids, and they face the reaction of society, which
        goes from malignancy to enthusiasm. Today they are only a small
        minority, and many people consider them as disrupted experimenters, but
        in the near future we may recognize them as pioneers.</image:caption
