        >Ben Winter returns from his tour in Afghanistan with the German ISAF.
        Having survived a suicide bombing, which claimed the life of his best
        friend, he is trying to find his way back to his old life, with his
        girlfriend, family and friends. But his memories are catching up with
        him. Increasingly, he is losing contact with reality and his trauma gets
        the upper hand. A near-accident makes him and his family finally aware
        of the deep-rooted trauma and feelings of guilt he brought back from
        Afghanistan and he checks into a veterans' hospital for
        treatment.</image:caption
