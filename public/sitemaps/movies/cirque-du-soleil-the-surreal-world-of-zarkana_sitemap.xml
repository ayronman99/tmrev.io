        >Zarkana is a Cirque du Soleil stage production written and directed by
        Fran√ßois Girard. It began as a touring show in 2011 and was converted to
        a permanent show in Las Vegas in late 2012. It premiered at Radio City
        Music Hall in New York City on June 29, 2011 and later toured to the
        State Kremlin Palace in Moscow and the Madrid Arena in Madrid. Following
        Zarkana's successful run in Moscow, it was announced that the show would
        start residency at the Aria Resort and Casino in Las Vegas. The show
        replaced the Cirque du Soleil resident production Viva Elvis, which
        closed in August 2012 at the Aria Resort. Zarkana by Cirque du Soleil is
        about a spirited journey through an abandoned theater where an
        extraordinary circus comes back to life. Populated by a motley
        collection of off-the-wall characters and incomparable acrobats, Zarkana
        is a visual vortex set in a twisted acrobatic fantasy universe where,
        little by little, chaos and craziness give way to a true
        celebration.</image:caption
