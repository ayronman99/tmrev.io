        >Veera Narasimha Naidu (Prabhu) is a faction leader in Kurnool who
        raised his sister Saraswati (Seetha) with love and Affection to make her
        forget the loss of their Mother. During the marriage time, she eloped
        with Basha (Suman), whom she loved which led the death of Narasimha
        Naidu's Father. Thus enraged Narasimha Naidu cuts the leg of Basha which
        created a rift between the two families. On a case to win the property
        belonging to Saraswati, Basha wins the case on Narasimha Naidu after a
        long gap of 25 years. Seeing the sorrow of Saraswati, her son Sulaiman
        (Vishnu Manchu) vows to unite the two families and waits for a
        situation.</image:caption
