        >Taro, who recently graduated from high school, doesn't know what he
        wants to do. He rents a house and plot of land in the country-side
        determined to make a living in agriculture. His expectation is great as
        the girl he likes, Yoko, will also go with him, but his father, recently
        laid off by his company's down-sizing, is also tagging along and so
        begins the the trio's strange life in the country. Set at a solitary
        house in the middle of the desolate, country-side, the relaxed tempo and
        off-hand humor are impressive despite the themes of parent-progeny
        conflict and reconciliation that unfold in the film.</image:caption
