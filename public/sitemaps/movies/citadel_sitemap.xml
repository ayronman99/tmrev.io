        >In the San Pedro male prison of La Paz, Bolivia, 1500 prisoners coexist
        in a space originally designed for only 300 nuns. Inside, it is like a
        small city, with businesses and services abound. The prisoners make
        their living inside the enclosure as they would outside. There is a
        strong self-organization that plans every-body's lives. As if it weren't
        enough, there are hundreds of women, wives of the inmates, and almost
        300 children, who chose to share their captivity. They are non-convicted
        beings that accepted living behind bars with the only purpose of
        preserving a united family. The documentary shows the life of a family
        inside the jail of La Paz.</image:caption
