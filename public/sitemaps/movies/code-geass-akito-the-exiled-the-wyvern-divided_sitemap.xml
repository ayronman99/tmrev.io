        >The war between Euro Britannia and the European Union continues. New
        orders are given to the W-0 Unit. To land in the middle of the enemy
        territory as a diversion. The pilots of the W-0 Unit consist only of the
        commanding officer, Leila, the only surviving Japanese from their last
        battle, Akito, and the three that escaped from the Eleven ghettos and
        lived in the underworld, Ryou, Yukiya, and Ayano. With everyone holding
        their respective expectations, the operation moves forward. On the other
        side in Euro Britannia, Shin, who made his benefactor commit suicide
        with the mysterious power of “Geass”, is appointed the leader of the
        Knights of St. Michael. As Shin steadily advances for the sake of his
        own ambition, he and his subordinates in the Ashura squad are given
        orders to deploy. The one that lives in order to fight, and the one that
        fights in order to live.</image:caption
