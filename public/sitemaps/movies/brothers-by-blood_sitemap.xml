        >Peter and Michael, raised on the streets of Philadelphia, are the
        children of Irish mob members, forever linked by the crimes of their
        fathers. 30 years later, Michael now runs the criminal organization and
        lusts for more power, his dangerous antics frequently held in check by
        his cautious cousin Peter. Haunted by the death of his sister, whose
        passing destroyed both his parents, Peter is caught between the dreams
        of childhood and the realities of his life as an enforcer. His only
        reprieve is a local boxing gym, a sanctuary that is quickly threatened
        as Michaelâ€™s desire for control escalates.</image:caption
