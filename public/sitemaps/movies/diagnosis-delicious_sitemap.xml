        >Chef Dave Oberlin's career is in shambles when his altercation with a
        famous food critic goes viral. After being blacklisted by the elite
        restaurants, Dave is forced to take a teaching position at his friend's
        culinary arts school. When cardiologist Nina Kirby is up for a promotion
        at the local hospital, the Head of Cardiology informs her if she gets
        Dave on board to teach the Healthy Living seminars she would be a
        shoo-in for the position. The only problem is Nina can't cook and she
        doesn't want to learn. With a little coaxing from her best friend
        Olivia, Nina agrees to take Dave's class. When Nina presents Dave with
        the Healthy Living seminars he's disinterested in working with her due
        to her lack of class participation. In her effort to persuade him to get
        on board, Nina and Dave come across some unexpected common
        ground.</image:caption
