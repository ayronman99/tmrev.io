        >AC/DC has long reigned as a titanic force in the world of hard rock,
        and never more so than when they were anchored by their original singer
        and resident wildman, Bon Scott. AC/DC - The Bon Scott Years movie This
        program offers a critical review of the band's Bon Scott years--from his
        first appearance in the early 1970s to his death in 1980--through rare
        archival material, interviews with rock critics and musicologists, and
        previously unreleased live performances of classics like "Whole Lotta
        Rosie" and "Let There Be Rock."</image:caption
