        >Prepare for school with Mickey and friends. Developed by Disney and
        leading educators, the animated classic MICKEY AND THE BEANSTALK now has
        learning breaks that will prepare your child for the academic and social
        challenges of school. Learning is woven throughout this classic
        adventure packed with storytelling magic that captures young
        imaginations. Pop-up visuals encourage children to learn about counting,
        matching, measuring, and putting a story in order. Watch your child's
        face light up each time a correct answer helps Mickey. Learning's more
        fun with friends to share the adventure!</image:caption
