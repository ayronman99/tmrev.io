        >Manja and Herry are your perfect everyday loving and romantic married
        couple. But, Manja is a leader of a pack of gangsters, which she tries
        to hide from Herry. Two years into their marriage, they still don't have
        a child due to an accident that happened to Manja in her past, which
        makes her feel helpless and inferior. So she searches for someone to
        give Herry a child, and also to divert attention away from her and her
        gangster group. Manja askes Reanna, Herry's co-worker to marry him. But
        upon marrying her, Manja is jealous of the relationship between her
        husband and his new wife. Conflicts happen between the two wives until
        one day, Herry is kidnapped by Min Siam. Being the leader, Manja heads
        over to her enemy's area to settle things once and for
        all.</image:caption
