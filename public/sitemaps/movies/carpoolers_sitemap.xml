        >Four travellers meet in Madridâ€™s city centre through a rideshare app.
        Four individuals who could never imagine the journey they are about to
        embark on, as they gradually exchange secrets, emotions and mistrust,
        eventually arriving at a very different destination to the one they had
        planned. Along the way, they will learn a lot about who they are
        travelling with... and about themselves.</image:caption
