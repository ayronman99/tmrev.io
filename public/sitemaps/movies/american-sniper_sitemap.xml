        >U.S. Navy SEAL Chris Kyle takes his sole mission—protect his
        comrades—to heart and becomes one of the most lethal snipers in American
        history. His pinpoint accuracy not only saves countless lives but also
        makes him a prime target of insurgents. Despite grave danger and his
        struggle to be a good husband and father to his family back in the
        States, Kyle serves four tours of duty in Iraq. However, when he finally
        returns home, he finds that he cannot leave the war
        behind.</image:caption
