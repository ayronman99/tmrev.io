        >In a remote Icelandic town, an off duty police chief begins to suspect
        a local man to have had an affair with his wife, who has recently died
        in a car accident. Gradually his obsession for finding out the truth
        accumulates and inevitably begins to endanger himself and his loved
        ones. A story of grief, revenge and unconditional love.</image:caption
