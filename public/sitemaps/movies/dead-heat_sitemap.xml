        >Boston cop Pally is forced into early retirement, putting a strain on
        his marriage. Pally's stepbrother, Ray, attempts to lift his spirits by
        tipping him off to a sure-bet racehorse. But their attempts to secure
        the champion equine are thwarted by a local mob boss, who steals the
        horse as repayment for a gambling debt. With their investment on the
        line, Pally and Ray become entangled in a web of underworld crime and
        murder.</image:caption
