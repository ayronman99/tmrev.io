        >Pastor Frank is struggling to keep his ministry alive dealing with
        dwindling attendance and the possibility of their lender foreclosing on
        their church building. He has to rally his team members to keep the
        doors of their church open. They decide to revamp their workshop team,
        update some of Pastor Frank's old messages, and host a city-wide
        fellowship and fundraiser. Will it be enough to save their struggling
        ministry?</image:caption
