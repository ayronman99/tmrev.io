        lawless city... where gangs rule the streets... The vicious and blood
        thirsty murderer Slater is their leader. The city is his domain... he

        and fights. His brother Mathis and his friends try to avoid trouble at
        any cost. Revenge becomes the motive to Mikey when his brother Mathis
