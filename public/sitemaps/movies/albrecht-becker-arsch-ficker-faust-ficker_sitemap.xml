        >Albrecht Becker was one of the last people to have survived the enacted
        Nazi suppression of homosexuals, which started in 1933, with the
        implementation of Paragraph 175. Imprisoned in Nuremberg from 1935 to
        1938, he then decides to enrol in the army. On the Russian front he
        starts taking photos. After the war he dedicates himself to his job as a
        cinema production designer and scenographer, working mainly with musical
        comedies. Becker had started to 'decorate' his body in 1943, practicing
        the art of tattoos and piercing and taking photos of his progressive
        transformations. The director puts the spotlight on the body of Becker
        with photographs resembling landscapes of a body which, by its constant
        mutations and history, left a mark on its century.</image:caption
