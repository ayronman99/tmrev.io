        >If you think it's funny to watch a drunkard, think of the fun you'll
        have watching someone on acid. This movie follows a doomed character who
        can't seem to go a day without tripping, venturing into one misadventure
        after another. Yes, taking acid can make a normal routine, like going to
        work, seem like an odyssey, complete with monsters (toilet sharks),
        perils (the sidewalk turning into an inferno), and beautiful maidens.
        Peter Steele from Type O Negative guest stars in this unusual
        comedy.</image:caption
