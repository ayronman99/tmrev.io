        >In 1945, as Stalin sets his hands over Poland, famous painter Wladislaw
        Strzeminski refuses to compromise on his art with the doctrines of
        social realism. Persecuted, expelled from his chair at the University,
        he's eventually erased from the museums' walls. With the help of some of
        his students, he starts fighting against the Party and becomes the
        symbol of an artistic resistance against intellectual
        tyranny.</image:caption
