        >Stella is a clumsy, cynical, imaginative and tormented teenage girl.
        After a life-changing car accident involving a dog, she convinces
        herself she must count her age in dog years: one year of her life counts
        for seven, and now that sheâ€™s turning sixteen, she is a centennial. For
        this reason, Stella thinks she has not much time left to live and pens a
        bucket list of all the things she would like to achieve before she
        dies.</image:caption
