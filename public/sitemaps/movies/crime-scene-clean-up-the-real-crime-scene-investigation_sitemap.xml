        >Crime Scene Clean-Up goes behind the scenes into a world few have had
        to enter â€“ the bloody aftermath of a traumatic crime scene. After the
        cops and coroner have come and gone, leaving their fingerprint dust and
        discarded gloves behind, what happens then? Who cleans up after death?
        Meet Ron Gospodarski, a man with unusual insight into a crime scene.
        Ron's business is to clean up after death, a business born out of the
        concerns of blood tainted by TB, Hepatitis and AIDS. Follow Ron on his
        daily journey through New York City.</image:caption
