        >A popular trend among Russian oligarchs is to purchase works of art.
        Why? It's a way to get into the Kremlin's good graces, to gild their
        imageâ€¦and to cover up the origin of their fortunes, often acquired in

        collectors as they attempt to follow in the steps of well-known
        collectors of the early 20th-century, Tania Rakhmanov's powerful
