        >Athena, The Goddess of War (2015) launches viewers into a universe
        filled with Gods and Goddesses, Humans and betrayals, love and
        redemption. When Zeus learns of a plan by Hades to enslave mankind and
        force them to fight alongside his army Zeus forges a key to restrict
        passage between the realms to protect mankind. Unfortunately, Hades one
        step ahead of Zeus has already sent his bride and Queen of the
        Underworld Persephone to earth to find the key to open the passage way
        to earth allowing Hades' evil and demonic creation called The Harbinger
        of Death to attack. The only thing standing between the impending
        invasion and certain annihilation of mankind is Athena, The Goddess of
        War and seven brave humans courageous enough to join the fight to save
        mankind.</image:caption
