        >Flora Lau’s debut feature is a beautifully formed, subtle film that
        focuses on the lives of two people with very different prospects – a
        wealthy Hong Kong woman and her mainland Chinese chauffeur – both trying
        to cope with life’s unexpected dramas. Anna (Carina Lau) struggles to
        maintain appearances with her status-conscious friends after her husband
        mysteriously vanishes. Fai’s (Chen Kun) wife is heavily pregnant with
        their second child, has no health care entitlements in Hong Kong and
        cannot give birth in their homeland without incurring penalties for
        breaching the one-child policy. While their daily routines intersect,
        their fates only momentarily converge and Lau elegantly critiques the
        social contradictions at play by paralleling their predicaments rather
        than constructing drama between the two protagonists. (Source: LFF
