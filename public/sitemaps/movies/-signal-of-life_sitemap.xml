        >At some point in the distant future, a massive, catastrophic earthquake
        strikes Tokyo, causing the temperature of the Pacific Ocean to rise
        meteorically and the largest typhoon in recorded Japanese history to
        sweep toward the city and inundate it with water. The Tokyo Fire
        Department and its team of crack rescuers swing into action, and shortly
        after they do, a distress call arises from an underground subway station
        - with repeated indications of the rescue code, 252 252, and the
        exclamation "We Have Survivors." It soon becomes apparent that the local
        rescue squad must attempt to save the survivors, doing so at the expense
        of their own lives and safety. Written by Nathan Southern</image:caption
