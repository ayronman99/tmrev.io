        >"When Prince William experienced a major building boom in the 1990s, a
        shortage of labor created a demand for workers, which led to an increase
        in the Latino population. Some of the newcomers were legal immigrants.
        Some were not. A blogger named Greg Letiecq began to write about his
        unhappiness with hearing Spanish spoken in public places. Finding an
        audience, he fomented about rising crime rates, rising taxes to pay for
        services for the newcomers, overcrowded dwellings, music played too
        loud, fast driving, and so on. He included Latino crime reports from the
        local police blotter. He even claimed armed members of the Mexican
        revolutionary group Zapatistas were moving to Prince William County." -
