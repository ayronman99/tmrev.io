        >Early Monthly Segments, filmed when Beavers was 18 and 19 years old,
        now forms the opening to his film cycle, "My Hand Outstretched to the
        Winged Distance and Sightless Measure." It is a highly stylized work of
        self-portraiture, depicting filmmaker and companion Gregory J.
        Markopoulos in their Swiss apartment. The film functions as a diary,
        capturing aspects of home life with precise attention to detail,
        documenting the familiar with great love and transforming objects and
        ordinary personal effects into a highly charged work of homoeroticism.
