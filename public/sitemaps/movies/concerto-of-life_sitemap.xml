        >Jilted by his first love, and abandoned by the woman he marries, piano
        teacher Jiansheng refuses to allow his misfortune to dilute his devotion
        to music and to his students. When he becomes critically ill, two of his
        former students, who have become internationally-acclaimed pianists,
        return to Shanghai to perform at a benefit concert in aid of their
        former teacher, who they owe so much. Unfortunately, Jiansheng is too
        ill to attend the concert, but can only listen to the 'live' radio
        broadcast of one of his student playing his favorite concerto,
        Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No.2.</image:caption
