        >Chris, a young crisp-enthusiast leaves an online complaint. He is
        extremely delighted by the friendly and understanding attitude of the
        employee who replies to him. Wishing to talk to her again, he continues
        to message the page, asking questions and trying to win the compassion
        of his new online-crush.The quest is not easy, as the uninterested
        employee just tries to do her job, avoiding any topic besides crisps
        with every occasion. Watch our hero surf through a wondrous digital
        world of crisp ads, mobile games and emojis as he tries to confess his
        love.</image:caption
