        >Food, glorious food! Some of the most sumptuous and involving films
        revolve around that most common of acts: eating. 18 MEALS is an omnibus
        film of criss-crossing stories divided into three segments; breakfast,
        lunch and dinner. Jorge Coira's debut feature, shot over nine days in
        Santiago de Compostela has enough tasty portions to please audiences.
        Amongst Coira's expansive ensemble are aging street musician Edu, a pair
        awaking from a one-night stand, a businessman visiting his closeted
        homosexual brother and a lonely housewife, Sol. Victor and Sol are two
        of 18 MEALS' most fascinating characters as they each hide something -
        his sexuality, her depression - from those around them. Best of all is
        Pedro Alsono as Vladimir, a local celebrity actor who makes a meal for a
        mystery woman who never arrives. Who hasn't gone to a lot of trouble to
        do something extra special for someone just to have it go
        unappreciated?</image:caption
