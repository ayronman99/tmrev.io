        >Algeria from above is the first documentary made entirely from the sky
        on Algeria. Through the eye of the famous Yann Arthus-Bertrand this
        documentary vividly depicts this great country, and its vibrant cultural
        and natural treasures. From North to South and from West to East, it
        shows us the entirety of Algeria, lives in the large hectic coastal
        cities, Atlas mountains, oases of the Sahara or gentle hills of the
        Sahel. With a rich past that seems to have crossed all civilizations,
        and a territory where all natural environments amalgamate, Algeria
        appears here in all its diversity and its unity.</image:caption
