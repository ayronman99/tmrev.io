        >Chandani wants to become a Mahout as her father. Her father decides to
        give her a chance and gives her responsibility for an elephant calf.
        Chandani is a girl in a male profession. Everyone doubts her abilities.
        The ranger Mohammed becomes her only supporter and shows her the world
        of elephants in the jungle. Here they save an elephant baby from its
        death. Strengthened by this, she makes progress in the work with her
        little elephant Kandula. But when Kandula is taken away from her, also
        her path changes.</image:caption
