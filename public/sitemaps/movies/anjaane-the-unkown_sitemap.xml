        children, Tanwi Gouri Mehta and Anand Mehta. They are wealthy and live
        in a mansion. Their idyllic life is shattered with the arrival of Sonia,
        who has an affair with Adiyta. Eventually, Aditya leaves his family for
        Sonia, leaving the wife and two kids alone. When it is found out that
