        >Bj√∏rn-Erik was a 19 year old devoted Christian. When he determined that
        he was gay who decided to kill himself rather than living a "dirty and
        sinful" life. Through excerpts from his diary we learn that he didn't
        seek any guidance and he got none. His friends and family are
        interviewed as well as a gay Lutheran couple and some Christian
        fundamentalists.</image:caption
