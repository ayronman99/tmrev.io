        >Anne Berger, wife and mother of two children, is looking forward to the
        family vacation on Sylt. However, on the day of departure, she must
        learn that her husband Stefan has an affair with his assistant. So Anne
        sets off with her children alone. In order not to be found for Stefan,
        she lodges in a small guesthouse, which is run by the somewhat grumpy,
        but kind-hearted Lina Hansen. While Anne finds an admirer in Lina's son,
        the idiosyncratic Fischer Jan, Stefan also makes his way to the holiday
        island. He is remorseful and wants to win Anne back at any
        cost.</image:caption
