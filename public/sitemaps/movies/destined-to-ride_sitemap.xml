        >Lily's life is turned upside down when she is forced to leave her
        friends to spend the summer on a remote ranch with her nature-loving
        aunt. She is surprised to meet an unlikely group of friends and
        Pistachio, the horse she has an unbreakable bond with. When her aunt is
        threatened by unfriendly neighbors, Lily knows it is up to her to save
        the ranch.</image:caption
