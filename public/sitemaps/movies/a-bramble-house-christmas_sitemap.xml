        >While settling his father’s estate, Finn Conrad becomes suspicious as
        to why the man left a nurse $50,000. His dad knew her for less than two
        months before he died. Just before Christmas, Finn wants what to reclaim
        what he considers his family’s money, going undercover to investigate
        the bed and breakfast the nurse has recently taken over. When Finn meets
        Willa, he discovers she’s not a conniving gold digger at all, but a
        woman in need who put the money to good use. When she discovers his true
        identity, will it keep Willa from ever trusting him
        again?</image:caption
