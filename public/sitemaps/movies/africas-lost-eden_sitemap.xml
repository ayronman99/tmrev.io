        >In the heart of Gorongosa National Park, Mozambique, the waters of Lake
        Urema explode with the thrashing of a giant crocodile tail. Gorongosa
        was once known as the place where Noah left his ark: 1,500 square miles
        of lush floodplains in central Mozambique, packed with wild animals. All
        around, enormous buffalo, soaring fish eagles, and countless antelopes
        roam freely. But on closer look, something strange is going on. Fifteen
        years of civil war has taken a heavy toll and many species have been
        almost completely wiped out. All the usual top predators and prey are
        virtually missing, except for one - giant crocodiles and thousands of
        them. Discover what is being done to bring this African oasis back to
        its former glory, including perhaps the most ambitious restoration
        effort ever attempted, with elephants, hippos and scores of zebra,
        wildebeest, impala and buffalo, being relocated into the
        park.</image:caption
