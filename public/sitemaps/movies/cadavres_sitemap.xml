        >Raymond is a jealous, misanthropic, couch potato. Angèle is a sexy TV
        star, childish and disillusioned. One Halloween, their mother, Solange,
        suddenly dies. Raymond calls his sister for the first time in 10 years.
        She agrees to meet him and begins to investigate their mother's death,
        all in keeping with her TV role of police commissioner. But nothing is
        simple with the Marchildons. Between a dithering Raymond, the ghost of
        Solange who continues to haunt her children, and Angèle who's going
        crazy interviewing suspects, one more bizarre than the next, and the
        bodies that are filling up the basement, it's hard to keep their love
        straight. But then, love was always a little twisted in the Marchildon
        household.</image:caption
