        >Preeti Sengupta (Tanushree Dutta) is an airhostess living in with her
        boyfriend Karan Malhotra (Rohit Roy). They share a nice 2BHK apartment
        in the northern suburbs of Mumbai and are befriended by their elderly
        neighbor Madhusudan Tanha (Anupam Kher), a struggling poet and lyricist.
        Tanha is a loner living with his only companion, a Persian cat whom he
        lovingly calls Shehzadi. Preeti is possessive and has issues with trust.
        When she mistakenly suspects her boyfriend to be unfaithful, she throws
        him out of the house but soon realizes she can't afford the payment on
        the apartment on her own. On the advice of a fellow airhostess, she
        advertises for a tenant to share her apartment. Enter Neha Bhardwaj
        (Neetu Chandra), a modest small-town girl asking for accommodation. Very
        impressed by her simplicity and respectfulness, Preeti believes she has
        found a perfect roommate. The two girls soon become close - their
        camaraderie leads them to even become companions.</image:caption
