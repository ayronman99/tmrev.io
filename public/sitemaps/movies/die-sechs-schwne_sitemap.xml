        >On her 18th birthday, Constanze encounters a highly guarded secret. She
        discovers in amazement that she has six brothers, who have been
        transformed into snow-white swans by a careless word from their father
        on the day of Constanze's birth. Constanze is stunned when suddenly the
        six swans appear. They explain to her sister that only she alone can
        curse the curse: for six years Constanze could not speak a single word
        and has to sew shirts made of stinging nettles. The shirts will be able
        to turn the swans back into people.</image:caption
