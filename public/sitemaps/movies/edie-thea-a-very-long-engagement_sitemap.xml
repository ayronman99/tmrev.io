        >After 42 years, feisty and delightful lesbian couple Edie and Thea are
        finally getting married. From the early 1960s to the present day, the
        tireless community activists persevere through many battles, both
        personal and political. As Edie says, "we just went on with this talent
        we have for wrestling joy from the shit". Susan Muska and Greta
        Olafsdottir return with a love story of two remarkable women whose
        commitment to each other is an inspiration to us all.</image:caption
