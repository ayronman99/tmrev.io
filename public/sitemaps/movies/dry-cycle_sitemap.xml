        >The sun is setting and we see Dave, an artist, at the Laundromat.
        Fretting over his wife's ticking clock, Dave happens upon Ruby, a
        tempestuous beauty on the run with a mean-looking baby on her arm while
        toting a gun. Thus begins a series of capers that revolve around the
        helpless, yet, testy baby, a strapping town sheriff, a gun-loving bounty
        hunter and a snitching clown. All are involved in an ever-twisting plot
        in a quest for ownership of the baby Lloyd. The all night journey
        ultimately provides all characters their unsought solutions towards the
        lives they've been wanting.</image:caption
