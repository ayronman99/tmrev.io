        >This entry in the Classic Albums series examines RIO, the 1982 release
        that put Duran Duran on the road to stardom. Looking back at the
        creation and release of the hit singles "Hungry Like the Wolf," "Save a
        Prayer," and many others, the critical retrospective analyzes the
        album's overall effect on the musical landscape of the early 1980s. The
        optimistic and celebratory album generated a string of hit singles and
        groundbreaking videos, catapulting the band to global stardom. This DVD
        tells the story behind the writing, recording, and subsequent success of
        the album through newly filmed interviews, musical demonstrations, and
        both new and archival performances.</image:caption
