        >When they were good, they were the biggest stars on a team that
        captured New York City and the 1986 World Series. But when they were
        bad, Doc Gooden and Darryl Strawberry broke the hearts of Mets fans.
        "They were going to be our guys for years," laments Jon Stewart in this
        evocative yet searing 30 for 30 documentary directed by Judd Apatow
        ("Trainwreck") and Michael Bonfiglio ("You Don't Know Bo"). Reunited at
        a diner in Queens, the pitcher and the power hitter look back on the
        glory days of the mid-'80s and the harrowing nights that turned them
        from surefire Hall of Famers into prisoners of their own addictions.
        Listening to Doc talk about missing the parade down the Canyon of
        Heroes, or Darryl counsel others at his ministry, you can only wish that
        these two very different men had not followed the same destructive
        path.</image:caption
