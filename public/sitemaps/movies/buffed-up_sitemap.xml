        >From the creators that brought you the movie ‘2Eleven’, Mula Films
        presents to you another classic Detroit blockbuster. In the soon to be
        released film, “Buffed Up”, the plot consist of a group of three college
        students on a mission to attain one thing… a pair of Cartier frames.
        With little knowledge on how to get their hands on the glasses, the
        group of college students are eventually forced to steal, hustle up the
        money, and even snatch the costly eyewear which leads them into a world
        of trouble. The directors of this “hood comedy” have collectively
        recruited a handful of stars and Detroit legends alike, such as IceWear
        Vezzo, KC Clark, DJ BJ, Kash Doll and more to headline this
        film.</image:caption
