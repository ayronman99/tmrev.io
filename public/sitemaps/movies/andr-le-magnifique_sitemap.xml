        >An actor who does not suffer fools gladly finds himself replaced by one
        in this comedy. The citizens of a French village decide to celebrate
        their history by staging a play that will chronicle memorable events
        from the town's past. The play's author, Alexis, casts his wife Janine
        (Isabelle Candelier) in the leading female role despite her odd way of
        delivering dialogue. However, for the male lead, Alexis hires an
        arrogant professional actor from Paris, Jean-Pascal Faix. The village
        simpleton, Andre , has volunteered to serve as a stagehand and prompter.
        When Andre mistakenly leads Jean-Pascal into a trash dumpster that's
        soon dragged away, he's convinced (falsely) that he's killed the
        Parisian actor -- and is determined to take his place so that the show
        will go on.</image:caption
