        >In April 2000, I started photographing Koichi Ebitsuka's works. Mr.
        Ebitsuka was a teacher at Tama Art University, and he happened to be
        appointed concurrently to the second department of art, where I work,
        and we became close. He was born in 1951, so he is 16 years younger than
        me. I wanted to think about and experience the "contemporary art" that I
        hadn't been to. And he, being selfish, visited his atelier and was shown
        around his works on an island in the Seto Inland Sea. For me, the year
        2000 was a year of Ebitsuka-san's sculptures.</image:caption
