        >The Everglades of Florida abduct us into an alien world. The phenomenon
        of an endless, flat, water surface produces a rich and beautiful flora
        and fauna. The abundance of fish provides food for countless species of
        birds and the boss of all swamps: alligators - gigantic, primeval
        reptiles as neighbours of the people that live here. However, the main
        goal of this journey is to find the Florida manatees. They are regarded
        as the most serene and gentle animals in the world. Year for year, they
        migrate up the rivers from the Gulf of Mexico. It is only here, at the
        pleasantly warm springs, where one can experience this comparatively
        unknown and extremely threatened species first hand. They move their
        stately bodies astonishingly graceful, as if they were dancers in an
        underwater ballet. Magical light effects of the sun enable a backdrop of
        turquoise coloured water and roots to shine brilliantly. All in magical
        3D.</image:caption
