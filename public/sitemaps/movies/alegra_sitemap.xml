        >Frac, a mime who is suffering from a severe bout of depression, happens
        to meet a troupe of circus entertainers and immediately falls in love
        with one of the stars, Giulietta. But while his affection for Giulietta
        and admiration for the performers gives him a new lease on life,
        Giulietta's father, the leader of the troupe, opposes the relationship
        and is determined to keep them apart. Meanwhile, Frac and Giulietta
        discover a gang of children who are held prisoner by a criminal leader
        who forces them to do his bidding, and they devise a plan to win the
        kids their freedom. .</image:caption
