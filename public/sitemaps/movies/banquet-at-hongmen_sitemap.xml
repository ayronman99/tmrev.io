        >The Feast at Hong Gate, also known as the "Banquet at Hong Gate",
        "Hongmen Banquet", "Hongmen Feast" and other similar renditions, was a
        historical event that took place in 206 BC at the Hong Gate (鴻門)
        outside Xianyang, the capital of the Qin dynasty. Its location in
        present-day China is roughly at Hongmenbao Village, Xinfeng Town,
        Lintong District, Xi'an, Shaanxi province. The main parties involved in
        the banquet were Liu Bang and Xiang Yu, two prominent leaders of
        insurgent forces who rebelled against the Qin dynasty from 209–206 BC.
        The event was one of the highlights of the Chu–Han Contention, a power
        struggle for supremacy over China between Liu Bang and Xiang Yu which
        concluded with Xiang Yu's defeat and the establishment of the Han
        dynasty with Liu Bang as its first emperor. The Feast at Hong Gate is
        often memorialised in Chinese history, fiction and popular
        culture.</image:caption
