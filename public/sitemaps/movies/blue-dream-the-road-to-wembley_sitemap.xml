        >A docu-film that traces the victorious ride of Mancini's Azzurri, from
        the debut match to the final against England. A troupe lived with the
        Azzurri for a month, to bring the spectators into the lives of the
        players and all the members of the staff, between training sessions,
        matches, travels and celebrations. An adventure told through the voices
        of the protagonists, who confided dreams, joys, pains and hopes to the
        cameras. "Blue Dream, the road to Wembley" is the completion of a
        project started a year ago together with the FIGC, to tell the national
        team's approach to the European Championships through the 4 episodes
        aired in the days immediately preceding the European Championship,
        bringing the new television language of the docu-series to one of the
        most important time slots of the first generalist network. "Blue Dream,
        the road to Wembley" is a project of the New Formats Development
        Department</image:caption
