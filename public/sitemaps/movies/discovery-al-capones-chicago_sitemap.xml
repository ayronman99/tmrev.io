        >Al Capone was born to Italian immigrant parents on January 17, 1899 in
        New York City. He moved to Chicago in 1919, and there he became a
        notable criminal figure and gangster. He played large parts in gambling,
        alcohol, and prostitution rackets. In 1925, after an assassination
        attempt on former head Johnny Torrio, Capone took control of the Chicago
        Outfit, of which he had served as the second in command. He was listed
        on the FBI's "Most Wanted" list, sold alcohol during the Prohibition
        era, planned the St. Valentine's Day massacre, and was eventually
        indicted and convicted of income tax evasion in 1931.</image:caption
