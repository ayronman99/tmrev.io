        >Twenty-year-old Cal returns from France to Britain after receiving news
        that his mother is ill. His finds his home city of Bristol facing hard
        economic times brought on by the global economic crisis, with poverty
        and crime on the rise and rioting and looting almost a nightly
        occurrence. It is not a warm homecoming as his sick mother remains
        stubbornly homophobic and wants nothing to do with the now openingly gay
        Cal while his battered Auntie Jane, now living in a run down council
        house, dulls her stagnation with welfare funded booze and disturbing
        attempts to sexually seduce her nephew. Navigating his way across this
        new landscape he meets a young student who needs his help. However his
        act of kindness brings him into contact with a lawless drug dealing pimp
        and a race against time to make peace with his mother and get out of
        town as quickly as possible. An intense tale of a family mired in
        poverty, angry and lost but still searching for love, respect and
        acceptance.</image:caption
