        >By following the lives of five Japanese individuals this documentary
        explores the problem of depression in Japan and how the marketing of
        anti-depressant drugs has changed the way the Japanese view depression.
        Marketing of anti-depressants did not begin in Japan until the late
        1990s and prior to this, depression was not widely recognized as a
        problem by the Japanese public. Since then, use of anti-depressants has
        sky-rocketed and use of the Japanese word "utsu" to describe depression
        has become commonplace, having previously been used only by psychiatric
        professionals.</image:caption
