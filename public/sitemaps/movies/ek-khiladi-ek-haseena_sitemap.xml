        >A career criminal tries to disprove the old adage that "you can't con a
        con man" in this Bollywood drama. Arjun is a confidence man who, after
        the death of one of his best friends, decides to pull a major scam to
        punish the killer. However, the plan goes awry, and he finds himself
        deep in debt to two of his partners, gangster Sikander and hitman Kaif.
        In order to even the score and save his own skin, Arjun is forced to
        plan an even bigger con, with one of India's most powerful crime
        figures, Jehanghir Khan, as the target. Helping Arjun pull off the scam
        of a lifetime are his friends and cohorts Bhatia, a master forger; Jack,
        an all-purpose swindler; and Natasha, a beautiful psychiatrist whose
        passion for the nooks and crannies of the human mind had caused her to
        fall for Arjun.</image:caption
