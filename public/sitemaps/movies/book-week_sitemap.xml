        >Nicholas Cutler is a smart yet self-destructive, once famous novelist
        who is stuck teaching English to iPhone-addicted teenagers at a working
        class high school. After writing a trashy zombie story he recaptures the
        interest of publishers who are willing to give him a second chance as
        long as he can prove he has cleaned up his act. However, what could have
        been the best week of his life spirals into chaos and he's forced to
        finally put others ahead of his selfish dreams.</image:caption
