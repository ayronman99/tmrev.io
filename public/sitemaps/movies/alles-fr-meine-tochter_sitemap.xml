        >Teacher Ines and journalist Boris have been happily married for 14
        years. But Ines suffers from her childlessness. Then she is confronted
        with a chapter of her life that has displaced her for many years: In a
        new student she recognizes her daughter, who she had released after
        adoption for adoption. Since Boris knows nothing about it, Ines can only
        trust her best friend Simone. Against her advice, she also seeks in
        private the proximity to the unsuspecting student. In doing so, she
        finds herself in a conflict between her responsibility as a teacher and
        her growing motherly feelings.</image:caption
