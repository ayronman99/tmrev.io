        >Writer/director Leslie Carde finds her villain in the US Army Corps of
        Engineers, an agency whose primary aim is supposed to be that of
        protecting the nation's citizenry from potential disasters caused by the
        structural failure of dams, bridges, levees, buildings etc. Instead, the
        Corps, in cahoots with the many politicians and congressmen who work
        right along with it, has been found, over and over again, to be derelict
        in its duties - guilty of negligence, of employing harmful cost-cutting
        measures, of having misplaced priorities, of engaging in outright
        deception, and of brokering sweetheart deals with pet contractors. The
        movie is unsparing in its treatment of the Corps, and Carde clearly
        views it as her own personal mission to hold that organization
        accountable for the many acts of criminal malfeasance it has engaged in
        over the years.</image:caption
