        >Only after an ambitious property agent, Charlie, joins a successful
        agency run by a rich couple, Gordon and Lucy, did he realise the
        horrific secret behind the company's success. They make a high profit by
        buying properties for cheap after someone has died or been murdered
        there and then selling them back with exorbitant prices without
        mentioning the truth to the buyers. Charlie is caught in an ethical
        dilemma where he continues on selling these properties but is constantly
        haunted by the supernatural beings there.</image:caption
