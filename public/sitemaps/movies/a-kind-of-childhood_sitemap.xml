        >This is a film which challenges our notions of child labor. It peeks
        into a world where the concept of childhood as we know it has no
        meaning, where children support their parents, and where work is just
        another part of growing up. This is Dhaka, Bangladesh. Following several
        children over a period of six years, A KIND OF CHILDHOOD is an attempt
        to focus on the realities of child labor, with real children, their
        struggles and dreams.</image:caption
