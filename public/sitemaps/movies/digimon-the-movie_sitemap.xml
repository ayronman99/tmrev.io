        >The first story focused on Tai and Kari Kamiya four years before their
        adventure in the Digital World. It shows their first encounter with
        Digimon and what happened to them (as well as the other children). Tai
        and Kari wake one morning to find a Digi-Egg that came out of their
        computer the night before and the egg soon hatches, revealing a Botamon.
        The Digimon then evolves into Koromon and then Agumon (not the same one
        that became friends with Tai in the series, and yet, somehow, both
        Koromon and Kari remember each other), who then goes out and
        unintentionally destroys a good part of the neighborhood with Kari
        riding on his back. A second Digi-Egg appears in the sky to reveal an
        evil digimon, Parrotmon. Agumon then Digivolves to Greymon but isn't
        strong enough to beat Parrotmon and is knocked out. Tai grabs Kari's
        whistle and wakes up Greymon, who defeats Parrotmon and disappears with
        him.</image:caption
