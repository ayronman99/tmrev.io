        >Back in the 80s, Camp Pocumtuck was one of the strictest and
        most-religious summer camps ever known. It was forced to shut its doors
        when a young girl was struck by lightning. Before that, it was the site
        of a Native American massacre. And before that, several women were
        burned at the stake for being witches. Nowadays, Mia’s friends are not
        too keen on transforming this dilapidated summer camp into the wedding
        venue of her dreams. Mia’s wound a bit too tight and somewhat of a
        control freak. Her gay BFF has the hots for all the groomsmen and her
        maid of honor just wants good cellphone reception. Even worse, she
        accidentally sent an email invite to her annoying high school friend
        whom she hasn’t seen in years. But nothing will stop Mia from having a
        perfect wedding, not even when people begin disappearing in the night,
        and especially not when a spirit-possessed Teddy Ruxpin starts telling
        her to hide the bodies.</image:caption
