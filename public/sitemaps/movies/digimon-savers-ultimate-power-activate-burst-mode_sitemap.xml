        >The film begins with around Agumon, Gaomon and Lalamon, whose partners
        have been placed in a magical slumber along with the rest of city's
        population, by a mysterious thorned vine that spread throughout the
        city. As the Digimon make their way through the silent city, they
        stumble upon a pack of Goblimon, led by an Ogremon, who are attacking a
        young girl. They scare off the goblins, and the girl, Rhythm, reveals
        that she is actually a Digimon, then explains that the thorns are the
        work of a Digimon named Argomon. The quartet sets out to confront the
        villain atop his skyscraper lair.</image:caption
