        >Nearly all of us have shot home movies: on film, on video tape, or
        using the digital cameras built in to our mobile phones. We have filmed
        our children, family celebrations, or holidays. Now, imagine how a
        home-movie might look like if it were shot in the Warsaw Ghetto at the
        beginning of the 1940s by a German worker on vacationâ€¦ 2 home-movies
        invites the viewer to look again at historically charged material from a
        different perspective and to think about our desire to pick-up a camera
        to record disasters.</image:caption
