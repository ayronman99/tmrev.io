        >Derya and Hakan are best friends. Derya is the one who makes soup when
        Hakan is ill and Hakan is there whenever Derya needs him. They are so
        deeply involved in eachother’s lives that they even have the keys to the
        other’s apartment. They don’t have any secrets between each other. They
        both think that in today’s world, people do not feel the love that our
        grandparents and even parents do. They think that couples consume each
        other. And therefore, everyone they meet seem shallow to
        them.</image:caption
