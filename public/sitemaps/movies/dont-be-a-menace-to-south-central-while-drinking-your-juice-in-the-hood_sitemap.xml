        >When Ashtray moves to South Central L.A. to live with his father (who
        appears to be the same age he is) and grandmother (who likes to talk
        tough and smoke reefer), he falls in with his gang-banging cousin Loc
        Dog, who along with the requisite pistols and Uzi carries a
        thermo-nuclear warhead for self-defense. Will Ashtray be able to keep
        living the straight life?</image:caption
