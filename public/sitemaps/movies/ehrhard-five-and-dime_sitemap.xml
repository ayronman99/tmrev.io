        >There are two little downtown stores that have been the cornerstone of
        Ehrhardt business for nearly a hundred years, the Ehrhardt 5 and 10, and
        Ehrhardt Grocery, once formerly called the L.M. Hiers and sons, both now
        owned and operated by Donald Hiers, the son of Claude Hiers, and the
        grandson of L. M. Hiers. He is quiet, always a smile on his face, a grin
        in his demeanor, and unobtrusive. "But he can be talkative," as one
        Ehrhardt native describes him. Hiers (Donald) was born and raised in
        Ehrhardt, but probably raised more in the 5 and 10 (five and dime) and
        the grocery store, than on the playgrounds and sand lots of Ehrhardt.
        Hiers is also a 1954 graduate of Ehrhardt High School and the Citadel in
        1959.</image:caption
