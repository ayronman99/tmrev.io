        >Matt is haunted by the death of a girl from a car accident he caused
        years ago. Matt was drunk and as he reached for the car radio, he struck
        the girl as she crossed the road. The guilt that he feels has altered
        his sense of reality, making Matt's life a mystery full of shadows and
        phantoms. Now, years later Matt goes away for weekend with his new
        girlfriend Dawn. After a wild session of lovemaking, Dawn goes for a
        walk. While she is away a strange man with an ax comes into the motel
        room and attacks Matt. After that incident Matt goes into the woods,
        looking for Dawn. There he encounters Dawn's family who tie him down and
        put him on trail for the murder of the girl years before. They find him
        guilty and he is sent back into the forest to be hunted down by the
        family. The deeper Matt runs into the forest the farther his mind is
        lost to the Blackwoods.</image:caption
