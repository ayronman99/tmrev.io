        >Schoolboy Maurice Cole, growing up in 1960s Liverpool, is picked on for
        being effeminate but is already making his own comedy tapes, one of
        which impresses agent Wilfred De'ath through whom he gets a job on a
        pirate radio station, changing his name to Kenny Everett. Though sacked
        for annoying the sponsor his popularity sees him working on the BBC's
        newly-formed Radio One. Around this time he meets and marries Lee
        Middleton, who not only sticks by him through his career lows but is
        sympathetic when, following a drugs over-dose, he admits to being gay.
        She even helps him find a boyfriend though, unlike his friend Freddie
        Mercury, he is reluctant to come out. Following their divorce Kenny is
        best man when Lee marries actor John Alkin and, in 1985, in typically
        flamboyant style comes out, owing to having not one but two 'husbands'.
        However, in 1989 he is diagnosed as HIV+ and, in 1995, a year after
        winning the prestigious Sony award, dies of AIDS aged
        fifty.</image:caption
