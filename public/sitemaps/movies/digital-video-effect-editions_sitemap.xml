        >This video was created and released into distribution as one work in a
        solo exhibition that Price held simultaneously at Friedrich Petzel
        Gallery, Reena Spaulings Fine Art, and Electronic Arts Intermix in New
        York in September 2006. As a video in the EAI collection, it is the one
        piece in the exhibition that remains "on-view" indefinitely, after the
        rest of the show has closed. The video serves as a sampler of Price's
        editioned videos to date, all of which have been sold through the Petzel
        and Spaulings galleries in small numbers. Here, fragments of sound and
        image from the editions have been brought together, yielding a montage
        that, while bordering on incoherence, provides access to these publicly
        unavailable artworks. Price juxtaposes disparate authors, editing
        strategies, and histories, yielding a work in the essay-film tradition,
        at once lyrical and messy, highly-edited and arbitrarily
        composed.</image:caption
