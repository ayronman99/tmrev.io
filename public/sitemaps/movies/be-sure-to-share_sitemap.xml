        >Shiro’s struggle with his father’s cancer and impending death leads to
        a realization that he must communicate his love and admiration for him
        before it’s too late. A series of flashbacks reveals their relationship
        over time, and the trouble Shiro faced connecting to his strict father
        who was also his teacher and soccer coach. With a consuming secret of
        his own, Shiro, now in his late twenties and about to get engaged, must
        eventually learn how to share the pain of it with his loved
        ones.</image:caption
