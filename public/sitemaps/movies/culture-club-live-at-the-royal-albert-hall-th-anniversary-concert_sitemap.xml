        >Live at the Royal Albert Hall finds Culture Club celebrating their 20th
        anniversary with an infectious and expansive grandeur, all while basking
        in the love of adoring fans. The show actually starts with a great joke
        on the audience: Boy George, looking not a day over 20, glides onstage
        in his once-trademark derby and beaded hair extensions, delivering a
        warm and welcome vocal on "Do You Really Want to Hurt Me?" The startled
        crowd soon realises he's an impersonator. The real, fortysomething
        George O'Dowd, looking a lot less androgynous and a tad thicker than in
        his New Romantic days, smiles self-deprecatingly and launches into a
        pleasing set of white soul ("Cold Shoulder", "Miss Me Blind"), stark
        gospel ("That's the Way"), stirring raga-rock ("Bow Down Mister") and
        even a classic (a lovely cover of Bowie's "Starman", complete with
        audience participation and muscular guitar by Roy Hay). It's a fine show
        all around.</image:caption
