        >Discovery will take you to where few have gone and where nobody wants
        to be. Cruise Ship Disaster: Inside The Concordia gives you an
        eyewitness account of the tragedy as the Concordia runs aground. The
        human and environmental toll captured the attention of the public eye
        and now Discovery Channel takes you inside the stranded ship. With never
        before seen footage from the evacuation, you can follow the Concordia
        passengers as they relive their flight to abandon ship and find safety.
