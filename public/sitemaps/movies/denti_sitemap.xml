        >Antonio is a man born with unusually large incisors; his freakishly
        huge teeth made him an outcast as a child and as man he has become
        obsessive and controlling in his relationships with women. Convinced
        that his girlfriend cheated on him (with her dentist, Ã§a va sans dire),
        Antonio insults her in a fit of anger and in the fight she breaks off
        one of his teeth. Antonio now must travel across the country, going from
        dentist to dentist in search of someone who can make a crown that will
        suit his extra-large smile.</image:caption
