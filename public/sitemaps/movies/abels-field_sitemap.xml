        >Seth McArdle (Samuel Davis) is a high school senior with an especially
        full plate. Not only must he navigate the usual social and academic
        pitfalls of high school, but he has to contend with his young twin
        sisters, serving as de facto parent in the absence of his deceased
        mother and deadbeat father. The pressure mounts when the bank calls with
        a foreclosure warning, and Seth's frustrations spill over into various
        altercations with the school football team. An exasperated coach exiles
        Seth to work after school with Abel the eccentric groundskeeper (Kevin
        Sorbo). Their relationship starts off cold and rocky, but as the two
        spend more time together, they realize they have more in common than
        either thought. The downside: it's pretty much pain and sadness that
        they share. The upside: God loves them.</image:caption
