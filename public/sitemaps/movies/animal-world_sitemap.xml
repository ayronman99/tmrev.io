        >Drifting aimlessly through life, Kaisi has racked up debts of several
        million having borrowed money from his friends. Lured with the promise
        of writing it all off, Kaisi leaves his ailing mother and childhood
        sweetheart Qing to board the ship Destiny and attend a gambling party
        controlled by the mysterious Anderson. All players join the game with
        stars. For each game they lose, their opponent captures a star. Everyone
        is holding daggers behind their backs plotting dirty means by which to
        overcome their opponents. The game quickly deteriorates into a slaughter
        and Kaisi must battle save his own skin.</image:caption
