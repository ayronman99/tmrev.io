        >After Debbie Smith was raped, she didn't take the law into her own
        hands. She wrote the law... Based on a true story. In 1989, Debbie Smith
        was living a quiet life as a housewife with her police officer husband,
        Rob and their two kids, but one day it's all shattered. While her
        husband slept upstairs, Debbie was dragged from her kitchen in broad
        daylight and brutally raped in the woods. After going through the
        dehumanizing rape-kit, she waited with fear and paranoia. Six years
        later, her rapist was caught through a chance DNA test. After learning
        how many rape-kits go untested and how long women wait to get justice,
        Debbie makes it her mission so no one women will suffer the long wait to
        get justice.</image:caption
