        >Simon Aubert runs his entire life on lies. An executive at an aviation
        company, he lies about everything… Simon’s self-serving lies are so
        abundant that the universe (governed by a handful of Buddhist monks, it
        seems) decides to right a wrong by teaching him a lesson and making all
        of the lies reality on the eve of his company’s crucial meeting with a
        Russian businessman that Simon absolutely needs to impress in order to
        prevent the closure of the small-town plant where his twin brother Phil
        works.</image:caption
