        >A visually based exploration and appreciation of the work of artist
        Dorothy Cross, showing many of the highlights of her career to date,
        framed by her evolving and passionate relationship with the sea. The
        film follows her as she embarks on a new sea-based project in New
        Ireland, an island off Papua New Guinea that is one of the last true
        wildernesses left on Earth. This documentary marks the first time the
        artist has agreed to participate in a film about her
        work.</image:caption
