        >Kids' comedy with all the clich√©s. Six boys (hero, pudgy, dumb, romeo,
        etc), reluctantly sent to summer camp, are grouped together in a
        ramshackle hut, and instantly identified as losers and outcasts by the
        overconfident camp bullies, who target gorgeous Tiffany (Jakub) as their
        Lothario's girlfriend. They set out to make everyone's life miserable as
        they impose their authority on the other kids and ineffective counselors
        alike. Andy, the good-guy hero, of course has a crush on Tiffany, but
        hasn't a clue how to approach her. Gradually, the nice guys gain the
        edge over the bullies, by honest endeavor and standing up for themselves
        - and in doing so, win over the other kids, even Tiffany. Until the
        bullies frame them and have them expelled.</image:caption
