        >Two seconds into the bubbling synth sounds of its theme song will have
        a child of the 1980s or ‘90s exclaiming “Reading Rainbow!” Such is the
        beloved and ubiquitous nature of the classic children’s literary
        television show that introduced millions of kids to the wonder and
        importance of books. Not only did the series insist on having kids speak
        to kids about their favorite stories, but Reading Rainbow introduced the
        world to one of the most adored television hosts of all time in LeVar
        Burton. Thanks to his direct, non-patronizing and, most importantly,
        kind delivery, Burton became a conduit to learning for children of every
        background—an entrancing guide to subjects unknown.</image:caption
