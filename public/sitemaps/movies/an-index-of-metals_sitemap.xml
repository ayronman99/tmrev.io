        >Shortly before his death, Romitelli together with his friend Paolo
        Pachini and the poetess Kenka Lèkovich, resurrected the dream of a total
        scenic art (a furnace of sensations, they called it, an_ initiation
        rite_) in the manner of the Futurists: rhythms and gleams of light
        striking metals (for the video part), poems in iron and chrome singing
        of fusion with matter (Kenka Lekovich), acoustic/electric music highly
        amplified, filtered, spatialised, in as artificial a manner as possible.
        An Index of Metals bears vigorous witness to this determination to go
        beyond: sizzling orchestration, electric and psychedelic; a voice which
        plays on effects, murmurs with reverb, cackles into a megaphone, screams
        like a pop star; and an electric guitar score of a kind that no
        ‘serious’ composer has ever written, sliding across an infinite range of
        tones with a lightness of touch and blurring of contours.</image:caption
