        >Tom,a junior doctor under suspension for fatally removing the wrong
        lung from a patient and nick-named Dr. Death,is working in Leeds as a
        paramedic with the knowing Julie,who sells sex aids from the back of the
        ambulance. After dealing with a man whose pet alligator bit his fingers
        off and a Goth who threw up so much an exorcist was brought in,Tom
        redeems himself by reviving an unconscious man. But he still has to deal
        with Rob Krizzo,the scruffy - and useless - lawyer engaged to fight his
        case and who accidentally injects him,not to mention Terence,from whose
        anus he once removed a mobile phone and who is now lustfully stalking
        him.And then girl-friend Lucy,another doctor,seems to be about to throw
        him over.</image:caption
