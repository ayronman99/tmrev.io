        >Mitch Buchannon (David Hasselhoff) was believed to have died in a
        boating accident at the end of the 10th season of Baywatch. However, it
        turns out he only had amnesia and has been recovering in a Los Angeles
        hospital. His new fianc√©e, Allison Ford (Alexandra Paul), resembles his
        old lover, Lt. Stephanie Holden (also played by Alexandra Paul), who
        died during the seventh season of Baywatch. However, she is cooperating
        with an old nemesis of Mitch's, the still undead Mason Sato
        (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) from the second season, to get revenge on
        Mitch.</image:caption
