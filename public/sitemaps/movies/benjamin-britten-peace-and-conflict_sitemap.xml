        >A feature film about Benjamin Britten, released as part of the 100 year
        celebrations of his birth. Britten is the most performed British
        composer worldwide. This film premiered at Gresham's School, which he
        attended, and focuses on how his life-long pacifism influenced his life
        and music. Written and directed by Tony Britten (In Love With Alama
        Cogan), narrated by John Hurt and with a superb cast of young people,
        including many supporting roles taken by students of Gresham's School,
        the film weaves dramatisation with a documentary
        narrative.</image:caption
