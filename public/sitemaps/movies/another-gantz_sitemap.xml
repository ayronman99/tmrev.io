        >Before finding out the Perfect Answer, discover Another Gantz. Aired on
        Nippon Television network before the theatrical release of Gantz: The
        Perfect Answer, this film is an alternate perspective version of the
        first Gantz film from the same writing-directing team of the two-part
        theatrical film. In addition to condensed scenes from the Gantz film,
        Another Gantz features a new subplot that follows an investigative
        journalist not included in the theatrical film. Delving deep into the
        mystery, Another Gantz offers another piece towards solving the complex
        puzzle that is the world of Gantz.</image:caption
