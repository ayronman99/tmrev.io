        >Pregnant again, Hannah is back with Tom, now working on the bins, and
        they are shortly to marry, with Derek giving the bride away. Derek
        himself spends the night in the home's caravan with girlfriend Tracey
        though it is unclear whether they did anything except sleep. Days before
        the wedding Hannah gets so annoyed with Kev that she throws him out and
        he is next discovered in hospital, suffering from alcohol poisoning.
        However, at Derek's request, she lets him back in on condition he gives
        up the drink and allows him to give her away at the wedding instead of
        Derek. Despite a bizarre speech from Kev the day goes well and some
        months later Hannah gives Derek her new-born baby to
        hold.</image:caption
