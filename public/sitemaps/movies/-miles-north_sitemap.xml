        >To claim a huge inheritance, two estranged brothers must travel to the
        wilds of Scotland in an old camper van to spread their father’s ashes.
        James and John haven’t spoken in ten years; John is now a thrusting
        executive with a wandering eye, James, a lonely, socially maladjusted,
        alcoholic. It’s only the sudden death of the father who rejected them as
        children, that draws them back together. Their father’s letters and the
        people they meet, start to heal old wounds, helping them come to terms
        with the pains of both past and present, but there is a secret waiting
        five hundred miles north in the highlands that could shatter them
        forever.</image:caption
