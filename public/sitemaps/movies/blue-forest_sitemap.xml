        >Nami lost his parents at a young age and later lost his grandfather who
        raised him. Nami closed off his heart from the world, only holding on to
        the words of his grandfather. Nami then meets Shimura and Nagaoka, who
        change his view on both the world and friendship. As a last memory of
        high school, the three of them go on a hitchhiking trip to northern
        Japan and have an unforgettable time.</image:caption
