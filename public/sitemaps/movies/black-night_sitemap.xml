        >After 8 years of self-inflicted exile Ishak reluctantly returns to his
        hometown. There, he must face the demons of his own past and inevitably
        confront his old community, who is reluctant to uncover its deeply
        buried sins. At his mother's funeral Ishak encounters a lovely vagrant
        by the name of Ferhat. Ishak followers Ferhat and as a result meets
        Sirma, his daughter who every once in while comes from the city to visit
        her father. Ferhat and Sirma are, in fact, the father and sister of the
        young forestry engineer Ali, who had been appointed to the village seven
        years ago and who suddenly disappeared; Ishak also knew him well. For
        Ishak, this encounter once again opens up old wounds from seven years
        ago. So what happened to Ali seven years ago "That night"? and what does
        Ishak know about the incident?</image:caption
