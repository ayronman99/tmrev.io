        >On Mihama, one of Tokyo's outlying islands, Shinji witnesses the rape
        of his girlfriend and middle-school classmate, Haruka, then commits an
        irreversible crime. But the following day, the island is besieged by a
        tidal wave which wipes out everything. Twenty-five years later, Shinji
        (Iura Arata) has a wife (Hashimoto Manami) and daughter. A childhood
        friend, Tasuku (Eita), presents himself to Shinji and discloses the real
        truth of his hidden past. Shinji will have to try and protect Haruka
        (Hasegawa Kyoko) again.</image:caption
