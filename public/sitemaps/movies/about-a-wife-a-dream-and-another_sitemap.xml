        >The film has two story-lines or "realities". The main characters are
        lovers, Maria and Vasin who discover they have access to an alternate
        reality wherein missed opportunities have become realities. In the
        film's first act, subtitled "The Pilot", Maria finds that she is in love
        with Vasin again after rejecting his marriage proposal twenty years
        earlier, when he was a lieutenant in the Russian Air Force. Vasin also
        lives a life of regrets, and wishes he was able to pursue his
        unfulfilled dream of becoming a film director. In the second act, "A
        Film Director", Maria is transported into a different reality. In this
        reality, she marries Vasin, and he becomes a film director. The plot
        questions whether they are truly happy with each other, despite having
        their wishes granted.</image:caption
