        >Continuous Journey is an inquiry into the largely ignored history of
        Canada's exclusion of the South Asians by a little known immigration
        policy called the Continuous Journey Regulation of 1908. Unlike the
        Chinese and the Japanese, people from British India were excluded by a
        regulation that appeared fair, but in reality, was an effective way of
        keeping people from India out of Canada until 1948. As a direct result,
        only a half-mile from Canadian shores, the Komagata Maru was surrounded
        by immigration boats and the passengers were held incommunicado virtual
        prisoners on the ship. Thus began a dramatic stand-off which would
        escalate over the course of two months, becoming one of the most
        infamous incidents in Canadian history.</image:caption
