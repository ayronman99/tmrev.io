        >Sandhya Joshi's mom had wanted her daughter to study, at least complete
        her graduation in Commerce, before getting married. Her husband,
        however, thought otherwise and before Sandhya could complete her
        education, he got her married to Madhav Desai, the first ever man to
        enter Sandhya's life. The marriage takes place and Sandhya moves in with
        Madhav and his mom. Madhav makes it clear that he wants a child from
        her, however, years roll by without the couple conceiving. The second
        man to enter Sandhya's life is Lakshman, who she hires to do the cooking
        and housekeeping. The third man is Anirban H. Pandopadhyay, a violinist,
        who lives in a rented apartment. Sandhya does not know that soon she
        will be arrested by the police for killing one of the three men in her
        life. Watch as events unfold to see who was killed and what possessed
        Sandhya to kill him.</image:caption
