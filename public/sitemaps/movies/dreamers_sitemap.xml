        >Thirtysomethings Linda, Radim, Tonda, Otakar, Dagmara and Silvie have
        been friends since they met as teenagers. All of them arrived in the big
        city, Prague, from their small home town. The euphoric dreams each had
        for themselves have not materialized and they are all starting to feel
        trapped in different ways. They all seem to know one thing: what they
        don't want in life. At a party back in their home town they reminisce
        over one of their early dreams: to buy a farm, live together and, most
        importantly, have fun with their lives. In the weeks that follow, each
        of them is faced with a crisis that brings this old dream into sharper,
        more sober focus. Can they make it a working reality? Do they really
        want to?</image:caption
