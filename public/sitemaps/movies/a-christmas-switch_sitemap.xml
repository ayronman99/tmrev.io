        >Christmas works its magic in this body-switching holiday tale about two
        very different moms who find that help is where you least expect it, and
        most need it. When struggling singer Audrey and wealthy record executive
        Julia collide at the mall, they wake up in each other’s lives the next
        morning. Audrey finds that, though Julia’s life is full of luxury, she’s
        missing the chance to connect with her family in any real way while
        Julia finds that, though she gets plenty of family time, Audrey can’t
        say no to anyone giving her no time for herself. As Christmas looms
        closer, the two women rush to figure out how to both help each other and
        switch back before they miss Christmas morning with their own
        families!</image:caption
