        >Modern finnish movie about two very different young adults that after a
        chance meeting end up making music together and fall in love. While
        Nellis parents have the perfect career and man planned, she dreams of
        becoming a singer. Through a chance meeting at the studio, she meets the
        young and grungy Hip Hop music artist Sunen and asks him to help her
        make a demo tape. Not only is the ensuing story about differences
        growing closer and the difficulties that have to be overcome, well told.
        Also the music is exceptionally well made. It is quite unbelievable that
        this is the first feature of the director.</image:caption
