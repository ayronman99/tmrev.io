        >2006 was the Bears' best season in 21 years, as they ended the regular
        season just one win short of the Super Bowl. Relive every moment of the
        powerhouse season in which head coach Lovie Smith delivered on his plan
        to return the team to glory. Rex Grossman led the hard-hitting offense
        with 23 touchdown passes, while Devin Hester earned an NFL record for
        most touchdown returns in a single season in his first year with the
        franchise.</image:caption
