        >More money flows through the family courts, and into the hands of
        courthouse insiders, than in all other court systems in America combined
        – over $50 billion a year and growing. Through extensive research and
        interviews with the nation’s top divorce lawyers, mediators, judges,
        politicians, litigants and journalists, DIVORCE CORP. uncovers how
        children are torn from their homes, unlicensed custody evaluators extort
        money, and abusive judges play god with people’s lives while enriching
        their friends. This explosive documentary reveals the family courts as
        unregulated, extra-constitutional fiefdoms. Rather than assist victims
        of domestic crimes, these courts often precipitate them. And rather than
        help parents and children move on, as they are mandated to do, these
        courts - and their associates - drag out cases for years, sometimes
        decades, ultimately resulting in a rash of social ills, including home
        foreclosure, bankruptcy, suicide and violence.</image:caption
