        >Holly, a professor at a small college, has had a long history of
        finding the wrong guy. She’s accomplished quite a bit in her life, but
        after her younger sister announces she is pregnant, Holly decides she is
        going to make an effort to meet Mr. Right. Meanwhile, David, another
        professor, is a single father, very smart and kind, but not the type
        that Holly takes notice of when the two are assigned to plan the
        Christmas Formal. At the insistence of her best friend, Holly signs up
        for the dating website “Cupid’s Arrow,” where she meets Josh, an
        attorney just hired by the school. He’s everything she wants on the
        surface, but has little to say beyond his work and good looks. Josh and
        David were roommates in college, so Josh recruits David to write poetic
        messages in an attempt to win Holly over.</image:caption
