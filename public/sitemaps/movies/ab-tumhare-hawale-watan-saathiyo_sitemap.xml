        >Major General Amarjeet Singh (Amitabh Bachchan) is a dedicated officer
        for the Indian army. His son Lieutenant Commander Vikramjeet Singh
        (Bobby Deol) follows in his footsteps and joins the army. Amarjeet is
        extremely proud of Vikramjeet but tragedy strikes when Vikramjeet is
        killed in action. Many years pass, Vikramjeet's son Captain Kunal Singh
        (Bobby Deol) joins the army but has no intentions of remaining there. He
        instead plans to leave, settle abroad and earn lots of money. Amarjeet
        is disappointed with Kunal as he hopes his grandson would do something
        to honour his deceased father. Kunal comes across a desert party and
        sees Shweta Bhansali (Divya Khosla). It is love at first sight for him
        but she totally ignores him and does everything to avoid him. However
        she is doing this for a reason- she was once married. Shweta fell in
        love and married Major Rajeev Singh (Akshay Kumar), unfortunately he was
        deployed for action on his wedding day and he had to leave his newly wed
        bride.</image:caption
