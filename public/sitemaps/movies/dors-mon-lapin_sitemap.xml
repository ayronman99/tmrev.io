        >It's the story of a young married man name Lionel who is swamped by
        colossal debts and whose wife is soon to give birth. At his wits' end,
        he decides one day to commit an irreparable act and kidnaps his
        millionnaire neighbors' 1-year-old baby. He demands a small ransom of
        â‚¬60,000. But Lionel is no criminal and all his attempts at exchanging
        his hostage for money fail. Meanwhile, he becomes increasingly attached
        to the baby. When he at last manages to get the money, he must come to
        terms with releasing his hostage.</image:caption
