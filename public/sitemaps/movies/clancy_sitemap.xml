        >Clancy Miller is an abused girl who runs away to elude social workers
        seeking to remove her from her home. Out on the streets, she meets Nick,
        an ill-tempered, homeless war vet. A corrupt mayor, desperate for
        re-election, offers Nick a reward to keep the girl out of site; his
        secret plan - to 'rescue' the girl in grand fashion in order to gain
        favor with the voters. However, a scuffle with a loan shark sends Nick
        and Clancy on the run to the nearby countryside. There, an unlikely
        relationship develops, as the angelic girl copes with the hard exterior
        of her newfound guardian. Meanwhile, the mayor's ambitions heighten, as
        the prospects materialize for a statewide 'manhunt' and a military-style
        rescue operation that will play out as the TV news cameras
        roll.</image:caption
