        >Join Barbie “Brooklyn” Roberts, Barbie “Malibu” Roberts, and her
        sisters Skipper, Stacie, and Chelsea on an underwater adventure as they
        transform into mermaids to help save the world of Pacifica! In Barbie
        Mermaid Power™, Barbie and Barbie are summoned by Isla (from Dolphin
        Magic) to compete to be the underwater Power Keeper in a series of
        challenges designed to find their inner powers. Through these
        competitions, they discover whether they are mermaids of Earth, Air,
        Water, or Fire, all while making new animal and mermaid friends. In this
        fish-tale of friendship, adventure, and bravery, Barbie, Barbie, and
        family experience first-hand what it’s like to balance the worlds above
        and below the sea and learn a lesson in finding their inner powers along
        the way.</image:caption
