        >An accident occurs and we dial 911, an ambulance arrives and we are
        taken to a fully equipped Emergency Room staffed with specifically
        trained Emergency Room Doctors. Forty years ago, that was not the case.
        How did we get here? Our film explores the dramatic history of modern
        Emergency Medicine, told by its maverick founders, in their own words.
        The historic take on the specialty allows us to contrast where Emergency
        Medicine is today with where it began, not too long ago.</image:caption
