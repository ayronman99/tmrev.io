        >"Man in the Sand" is a 1999 music documentary that chronicles the
        collaboration between Billy Bragg and Wilco, which involved the
        musicians creating new music to accompany lyrics that were written
        decades earlier by folk singer Woody Guthrie. The project, which was
        organized by Woody's daughter Nora, spawned two albums: "Mermaid
        Avenue," released in 1998, and "Mermaid Avenue Vol. II," released in
        2000.</image:caption
