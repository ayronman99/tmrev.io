        >With a career that has passed the 40-year mark, Cesar Camargo Mariano
        continues to stay on top of his game. His arranging skills are unique
        and are permanently set in Brazilian music through singers such as Elis
        Regina, Simone and just about the best in Brazil and around the world.
        On the other side of this duo, we find Pedro Mariano, son of Cesar
        Camargo Mariano and the late Elis Regina. Though father and son had
        previously collaborated in Pedro’s three solo albums, with Piano &amp;
        Voz they formalize that artistic synergy with a memorable recording
        (also available on DVD). Piano &amp; Voz had a limited release of 10,000
        units, but in case you are not able to get a hold of the album, there is
        also DVD release of the same project. You can hear samples of this album
        in either Pedro Mariano‘s or Cesar Camargo Mariano‘s web sites. Better
        yet, you can see and hear Cesar Camargo Mariano talking about each track
        in the CD and DVD at Trama.</image:caption
