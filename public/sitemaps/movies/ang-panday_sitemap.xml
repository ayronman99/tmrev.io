        >Long ago, the evil wizard Lizardo sent an army of monsters to subjugate
        the land and its people. Lizardo succeeded, but a prophecy tells of a
        comet that will fall to Earth, and a man who will wield a weapon that
        will free the people from Lizardo's tyranny. Flavio is a blacksmith
        content with living a quiet, uneventful life in a town mostly untouched
        by Lizardo's evil. But when the comet of prophecy lands on the outskirts
        of town, Flavio's destiny is immediately made clear. Around the
        peace-loving but brave Flavio. His arch-enemy Lizardo attempts to ruin
        the peace and harmony of their dwelling place, affecting the
        inhabitants. Moreover, the evil warlord challenges Flavio by capturing
        his beautiful lady love Maria. A series of events take place, bringing
        the blacksmith (panday) at the forefront of a full-blown war against
        Lizardo's troops.</image:caption
