        >Over a period of five years, filmmaker Sarah George chronicled the
        lives of several modern-day train hoppers, a vanishing culture to which
        she also belongs. These individualists choose to eschew the comforts of
        modern American life to pursue the freedom and unpredictability of
        riding the rails, a choice that reflects both their lifestyle preference
        and a personal philosophy that is often based on environmental concerns.
        Through Sarah's insightful interviews, the modern hobos discuss their
        unique experiences and the incredible thrill of train-hopping. - Written
