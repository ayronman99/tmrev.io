        >Echoes of the Invisible interweaves a mosaic of profound quests: a
        blind man running alone from the lowest point in the western hemisphere
        to the highest mountain peak in the U.S.; artist Rachel Sussman’s
        struggles to photograph the oldest continuously living things on Earth;
        journalist Paul Salopek’s 21,000-mile walk retracing the migration route
        through which our ancestors first discovered the planet; astronomers and
        physicists attempting to see into the furthest depths of time; and monks
        probing the most extreme environment of all - the human heart. They
        discover, in their own way, something that transcends all that divides
        us in a world lost in the speed and noise of the digital
        age.</image:caption
