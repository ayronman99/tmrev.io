        >This is the intimate untold story of the legendary painter, Carlos
        Almaraz. It chronicles the life of an extraordinary artist and his
        impact on the Chicano Art Movement; the challenges, the demons, the
        struggles, the travels, the explorations through sexuality and art
        movements around the globe. A new and essential perspective shares the
        artist's full dimensionality in his unique and often humorous voice. It
        offers a complete view of the complex man, artist, activist, husband,
        and father. Offering an intimate portrait of a precocious East Los
        Angeles youth, struggling New York artist, spiritual seeker,
        intellectual, cultural worker, activist, charismatic leader of the
        Chicano Art Movement, comrade to Cesar Chavez and the United Farm
        Workers Union and an artist pursuing his dreams. It also shines a light
        upon the insidious dimensions of the AIDS epidemic during the
        80's.</image:caption
