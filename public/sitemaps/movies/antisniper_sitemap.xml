        >The tax service, together with the investigating authorities and
        special forces of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, is investigating
        major financial frauds, accompanied by a series of murders of people
        involved in the crime. “Orders” are executed, undoubtedly, by a talented
        sniper. Among the alleged victims - the head of a major chemical plant
        Boris Morin. Employees of the Organized Crime Control Department offer
        Morin a mutually beneficial deal: in order to stay alive, he must
        disclose his financial developments to them. Leading analyst of the
        State Tax Administration Tatyana Uvarova is connected to the
        investigation.</image:caption
