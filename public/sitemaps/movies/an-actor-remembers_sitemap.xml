        >In 1988 and 1989, the late Cesar Hernando, writer Ian Victoriano and I
        started a series of interviews of LVN actors, directors and technicians
        with the intention of publishing a book on the story of LVN Pictures,
        one of the major studios of the studio era. One of our interviewees was
        the great character actor, Joseph de Cordova. In 2006 I made a short
        documentary using excerpts from that thoroughly engaging interview and
        included it as an added feature to the privately authored DVD of “Biyaya
        ng Lupa,” where Joseph plays Bruno, one of the actor’s most memorable
        roles.</image:caption
