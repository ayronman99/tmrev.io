        >18-year old David grew up assuming that his mother and his father have
        died when he was a baby. He was raised by a monk and is close to
        completing High School. He gets into a fight during a party and
        discovers he is stronger than he thought he was- also, the blooding of
        an injury stops immediately and the wound heals within an hour. All of a
        sudden, the Priory of Sion and the Knights Templar show interest in the
        boy and the quest for the Holy Grail begins once again, with David being
        the one who can lead them to it.</image:caption
