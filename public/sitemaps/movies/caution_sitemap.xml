        >Since the post-election period in 2010, the poor farm-less people from
        Malatto village group, Maubin district in Ayeyarwaddy region have been
        struggling hard for their living almost every year. This happens since
        there has been less and less land in the region where they can earn
        their living. Their rights to use natural resources in their local area
        has been limited. So, they face lots of difficulties in meeting their
        basic needs. When the stakeholders of the water and land areas in that
        region have got the right to open their hearts, we can hear the “Whisper
        from Malatto”.</image:caption
