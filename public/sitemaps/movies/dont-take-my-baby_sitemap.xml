        >Factual drama which tells the story of a disabled couple's agonising
        struggle to keep their newborn baby. Based on real-life testimony, this
        emotional tale will call viewers' prejudices and beliefs about the
        disabled community and society as a whole into question, as we learn
        about a situation many disabled couples find themselves in as new
        parents. Can 21-year-old wheelchair user Anna and partially-sighted Tom
        provide the care and attention their daughter needs, or will social
        worker Belinda have to consider alternative care?</image:caption
