        >Sixties couples Michael and Donna and Paul and Erica become involved
        with the intense Count Yorga at a Los Angeles s√©ance, the Count having
        latterly been involved with Erica's just-dead mother. After taking the
        Count home, Paul and Erica are waylayed, and next day a listless Erica
        is diagnosed by their doctor as having lost a lot of blood. When she is
        later found feasting on the family cat the doctor becomes convinced
        vampirism is at work, and that its focus is Count Yorga and his large
        isolated house.</image:caption
