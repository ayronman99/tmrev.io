        Somewhere along the line in all action sports it became uncool to show
        how stoked you were when you did something sick. What's that all about?
        Skiing is about that surge of adrenaline and stoke, not about feeling
        the hate of the image police. At Matchstick, we are stoked and we have
        to let it out. We have thrown caution to the wind and dared to put the
        stoke back in skiing. The result is CLAIM, The Greatest Ski Movie...
        EVER! A truly epic film shot in the most amazing locations, featuring
        the best and boldest skiers in the world today.</image:caption
