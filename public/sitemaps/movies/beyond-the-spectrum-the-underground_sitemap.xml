        >Phil Schneider died in 1996. Previous to his death he had been on tour
        across the United States speaking out about various subjects including
        his involvement with building a secret underground base in Dulce, New
        Mexico for the military. During this time, he was said to have had an
        encounter with a violent E.T race in the late 1970's which would change
        his whole life immediately after. This documentary explores some of the
        information Phil Schneider spoke about to the public in the 1990's by
        examining each claim in detail with expert opinions from Richard Dolan,
        Richard Sauder, and Cynthia Drayer (Phil's Ex-Wife). In this documentary
        you will find never before published photo's of Phil's Autopsy,
        documents about the Philadelphia Experiment from Oscar Schneider's files
        (Phil's father) and a very well explained background about Underground
        Bases.</image:caption
