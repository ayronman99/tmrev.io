        >The filmic material was exposed, as the title suggests, at a martial
        arts expo in which Kirby’s young son James was undergoing his black belt
        examination. Here, saturated color frames reminiscent of the earlier
        exposure-works are disrupted by pure black-and-white scan lines and
        video feedback. It is a summary work, combining techniques from several
        different phases of Kirby's practice, and this allows Kirby’s improv
        strategy to achieve a new level of freedom, with certain expected formal
        gestures disrupted by whole new frames of reference. (Michael
