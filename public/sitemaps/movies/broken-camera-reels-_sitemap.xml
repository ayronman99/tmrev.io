        >The film consists of two rolls of film I shot in 1998 or 1999 while
        living in a Bushwick loft. I was interested in the perfect simplicity of
        a movie camera and what happens when a single part is disabled. So I
        found simple old cameras and deliberately broke one part, to see what
        happened. In the first reel, I removed the claw. In the second, I
        removed the shutter. As I recall, I also have a scheme of swinging the
        camera back and forth and up and down and various f-stop settings. Very
        Ernie Gehr. Playing, drinking beer & shooting film. No editing to speak
        of.</image:caption
