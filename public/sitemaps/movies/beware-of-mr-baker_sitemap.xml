        >Ginger Baker is known for playing in Cream and Blind Faith, but the
        world's greatest drummer didnâ€™t hit his stride until 1972, when he
        arrived in Nigeria and discovered Fela Kuti's Afrobeat. After leaving
        Nigeria, Ginger returned to his pattern of drug-induced
        self-destruction, and countless groundbreaking musical works, eventually
        settling in South Africa, where the 73-year-old lives with his young
        bride and 39 polo ponies. This documentary includes interviews with Eric
        Clapton, Steve Winwood, Carlos Santana and more. Beware of Mr. Baker!
        With every smash of the drum is a man smashing his way through
        life.</image:caption
