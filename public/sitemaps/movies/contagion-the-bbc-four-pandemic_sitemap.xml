        >The government rates the global outbreak of a deadly flu virus as a
        major threat to the UK. It could happen at any time. To predict the
        impact of the next pandemic more accurately than ever before, new data
        is needed. Dr Hannah Fry is on the case. She sets out to recruit the
        nation to download the BBC Pandemic app in a ground-breaking experiment
        to help plan for when that happens. How quickly will it spread? How many
        could it kill? What can we do about it? Hannah masterminds the
        experiment and adopts the role of Patient Zero by walking the streets to
        launch the outbreak. Meanwhile, an emergency physician finds out why flu
        is still such a danger a century after flu killed up to 100mi people. He
        meets researchers trying to discover what makes some people more
        contagious and visits a factory that will produce vaccine when the next
        pandemic flu virus emerges. Armed with the information he gathers and
        the results of the BBC Four Pandemic experiment, they make a shocking
        revelation.</image:caption
