        >It's the 22nd of December. Sixteen years have passed since the
        revolution, and in a small town Christmas is about to come. Piscoci, an
        old retired man is preparing for another Christmas alone. Manescu, the
        history teacher, tries to keep up with his debts. Jderescu, the owner of
        a local television post, seems not to be so interested in the upcoming
        holidays. For him, the time to face history has come. Along with Manescu
        and Piscoci, he is trying to answer for himself a question which for 16
        years has not had an answer: "Was it or wasn't it a revolution in their
        town?"</image:caption
