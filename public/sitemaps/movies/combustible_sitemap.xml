        >The city of Edo, the 18th century. Owaka, the daughter of a merchant
        family, and her childhood friend Matsukichi. The two were drawn to each
        other, but Matsukichi has been disowned by his family, and is working
        for the city fire brigade. Meanwhile, negotiations begin for the
        arrangement of Owaka's marriage. Unable to let go of her thoughts of
        Matsukichi, her mad emotions make her bring about a massive inferno
        which razes Edo. By chance encounter, the two meet again amidst the
        fires.It is an epic spectacle set against the stage of the massive
        metropolis of Edo.</image:caption
