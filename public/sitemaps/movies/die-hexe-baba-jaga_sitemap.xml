        >You take: a crazy witch, a pretty girl, a simple miller's boy, a
        stuttering cockroach, the Father Frost, together with his snowflake
        Snegurochka, and a pinch of Russian soul - ready is the basic material
        for the first part of the great fairy tale fun! The hunt begins and
        bankruptcies, bad luck and mishaps are inevitable. Of course, Father
        Frost and his chubby assistant Snegurochka, the snowflake, switch on and
        complete the hustle and bustle. In 2005, the witch Baba Jaga saw the
        light of the theater world with this piece and became a cult. Almost
        half a million spectators have since visited Baba Yaga on her subsequent
        adventures. Today, nine years later, the first part has lost nothing of
        its charm - still the little ones are happy about the crazy witch and
        the big ones laugh when Father Frost saves his big snowflake from
        bursting.</image:caption
