        >Bombay to Bangkok is a Bollywood film starring Shreyas Talpade and Lena
        Christensen in the lead roles. It is written and directed by Nagesh
        Kukunoor and produced by Elahe Hiptoola and Rahul Puri. Shankar (Shreyas
        Talpade), a petty thief, in desperate need of money, steals from the
        local don (Naseeruddin Shah) and escapes his way into a team of doctors
        heading for relief work to Bangkok. Unfortunately, he loses the
        all-important money bag in the chaos. In Bangkok, his world turns upside
        down at a massage parlour where he bumps into Jasmine (Lena
        Christensen). The hitch is, she is all Thai and he can't converse with
        her at all. A ray of hope comes his way the next day when Jasmine turns
        up desperately in need of a doctor. Shankar, posing as a doctor along
        with the Sardar buddy Rachinder, jumps into this whirlpool, while
        Jasmine soon gets pulled into his bumbling adventures while running away
        from the don and his son (Vijay Maurya).</image:caption
