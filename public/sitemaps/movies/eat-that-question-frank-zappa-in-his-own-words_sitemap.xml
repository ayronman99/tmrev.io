        >Thorsten Schütte’s film is a sharply edited and energetic celebration
        of Zappa through his public persona, allowing us to witness his shifting
        relationship with audiences. Utilizing potent TV interviews and many
        forgotten performances from his 30-year career, we are immersed into the
        musician’s world while experiencing two distinct facets of his complex
        character. At once Zappa was both a charismatic composer who reveled in
        the joy of performing and, in the next moment, a fiercely intelligent
        and brutally honest interviewee whose convictions only got stronger as
        his career ascended.</image:caption
