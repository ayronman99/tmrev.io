        >Fisyah (played by Natasha Rizki) has a trauma it is not easy to trust
        men because her father had left her. Even so, he has a special feeling
        for Jidan (Andi Arsyil), a neighbor who lives near his home. This
        feeling emerged from childhood. He hopes that one day Jidan will come to
        propose to him. What do you want to say, Jidan turns out to apply for
        her brother, Salsya (Merdi Octav) who works as a doctor. Fisya felt a
        broken heart that made it harder for him to open his heart to men. He
        was silent and kept his feelings secret because he did not want to make
        his brother hurt.</image:caption
