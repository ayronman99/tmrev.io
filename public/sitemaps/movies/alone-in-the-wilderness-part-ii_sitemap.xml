        >Dick Proenneke's simple, yet profound account of his 30 year adventure
        in the remote Alaska wilderness continues in this sequel to "Alone in
        the Wilderness". Watch through his eyes as he continues to document with
        his 16mm wind-up Bolex camera, capturing his own amazing craftsmanship,
        the stunning Alaskan wildlife and scenery and even a visit from his
        brother Ray (Jake). His epic journey takes you on a vacation away from
        the hustle and bustle of today's fast-paced society, and is a true
        breath of fresh air.</image:caption
