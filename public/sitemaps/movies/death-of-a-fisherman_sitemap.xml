        >One morning, the body of a sailor is found lying on the beach, washed
        in by the tide.. With no witnesses or any sign of the dead man’s boat,
        Inspector Leo Caldas begins immersing himself in the town’s seafaring
        atmosphere as he endeavours to shed light on the crime. He finds himself
        among men and women who prefer not to reveal their suspicions to him.
        But a sudden discovery sets him off in an unexpected
        direction.</image:caption
