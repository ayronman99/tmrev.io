        >Walt Sherill is attacked and beat down by a group of juvenile
        delinquents on his way home from work one night. The boys who attacked
        him are not previously known by the police and are therefore hard to
        track down. As Sherill starts getting impatient he begins his own
        investigation. Meanwhile, Detective Sergeant Koleski does his best to
        track down the culprits.</image:caption
