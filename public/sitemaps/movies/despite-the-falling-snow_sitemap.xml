        >New York, 1961. Alexander Ivanov, a high-ranked Soviet bureaucrat,
        reluctantly defects to the West while is part of a diplomatic mission,
        feeling the grief of being unable to know the fate of his wife Katya,
        whom he has had to leave behind in Moscow. Only many years later, in
        1991, he will finally find out the truth when his niece Lauren travels
        to Moscow to participate in a painting exhibition.</image:caption
