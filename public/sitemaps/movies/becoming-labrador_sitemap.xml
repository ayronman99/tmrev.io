        >In the stark Labrador interior, a growing number of Filipino workers
        have recently landed in the small regional hub of Happy Valley-Goose
        Bay, travelling halfway around the world for jobs they hope will offer
        their families new opportunities and a better life. Becoming Labrador
        follows a handful of those women and men as they make a place for
        themselves in Labrador's profoundly foreign climate and culture, and
        deal with the unexpected costs of living far from parents, partners and
        children. Combining documentary footage with interpretive animation, and
        bringing together the vision of three of Canada's best young directors,
        Becoming Labrador is a remarkable feat of collaborative authorship. It
        offers an intimate account of the radical mobility and displacement of
        the modern world, and of how tenaciously people hold to their roots in
        the midst of fundamental change.</image:caption
