        >Following the arrival of an unwanted guest, a tightly-knit bond between
        two codependent sisters is put to the test when their idyllic playdate
        takes a dark turn. ALBION ROSE, directed by first-time director Tiffany
        Tenille, is a coming-of-age drama with hints of magical realism and dark
        fairytale elements that paints a delicate, yet emotionally charged
        portrait of a fanciful young woman desperately cradling the enchantment
        of her girlhood as she struggles to face the harsh reality that her big
        sister has outgrown her.</image:caption
