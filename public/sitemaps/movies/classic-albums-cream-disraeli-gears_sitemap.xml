        >This addition of Disraeli Gears to the acclaimed Classic Albums series
        features brand new interviews with Clapton, Baker and Bruce, along with
        lyricist Pete Brown, Atlantic Records founder Ahmet Ertegun, John Mayall
        and Manfred Mann. Also included on the DVDare acoustic performances,
        original studio tracks and archival live footage. Included are
        additional interviews and analysis of the tracks, Exclusive acoustic
        performances, exclusive solo piano performance and previously unreleased
        full live performances. Though they were only together for two brief
        years (1966-1968), the London-based power trio Cream changed the face of
        rock with their jazz-schooled psychedelic blues--and never more so than
        on their 1967 classic DISRAELI GEARS. This program offers a critical
        review of the landmark album through archival footage, rare live
        performance clips, and interviews with rock critics, musicologists, and
        band members.</image:caption
