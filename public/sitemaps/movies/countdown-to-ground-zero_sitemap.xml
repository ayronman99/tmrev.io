        >A gripping, dramatic look, with the most recently released materials,
        at the extraordinary events of September 11th, 2001...not just this
        infamous day in history, but also how this day came to be through the
        dramatic stories of people whose lives converge at a moment when history
        turns. We'll recount the story of Al Qaeda's agents as they plan and
        execute the most deadly strike on the US since Pearl Harbor. It's also
        the story of the men and women who were attacked in the World Trade
        Center, and of the heroic rescuers who risked everything to save those
        trapped inside the doomed Twin Towers. And finally, it's also a
        political action thriller. It portrays FBI agents and counterterrorism
        experts in the months leading up to the attack as they desperately try
        to convince key players in both the Clinton and Bush administrations of
        the dangers of Al Qaeda and the possibility of a deadly attack on US
        soil.</image:caption
