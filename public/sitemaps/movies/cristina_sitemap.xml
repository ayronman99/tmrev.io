        >An intimate journey of a 37-year-old Cristina, as fate brings to her
        life both a new love and an unbeatable challenge. Determined to pass on
        a message of hope and a 'live in the now' mentality, Cristina's second
        cancer takes a toll on her diminishing body, however her love for Bruce
        only grows. Bruce stands by her side while juggling work and financial
        strains. The film follows Cristina's journey into her deep AMOUR, one
        that supports and lifts her up. If she had to choose between finding
        this deep and pure love and having cancer, or being cancer free but
        never experiencing true love... what would she choose? Her shocking
        answers are captured by veteran filmmaker Mich√®le Ohayon on
        camera.</image:caption
