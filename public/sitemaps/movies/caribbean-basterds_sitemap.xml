        >Three young people - Roy, Linda and José - who become pirates because
        they end up involved in the drug traffic. Out of need and greed, they
        find themselves caught up in something much bigger than them. It all
        begins as a joke but gradually becomes a cruel and dangerous game all
        the way to the final catharsis. The three main characters, Roy, his
        sister Linda and her boyfriend José, start out as avengers but turn into
        merciless criminals in an endless series of holdups and brutal acts of
        violence.</image:caption
