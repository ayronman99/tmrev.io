        >Tony has been dead for only about two or three years. Maybe seven. It's
        hard to follow the flow of time without a heartbeat. The days pile up
        and are meaningless when you are dead, but that isn't Tony's biggest
        beef with the afterlife. The city is the same as when Tony was alive but
        everyone is a stranger. The denizens pass their time maintaining an
        arbitrary set of rules passed down from a time they cannot remember. The
        dead live in an endless autumn where change is not only rare but
        considered gauche. Can a soul find love and meaning in a joint like
        this?</image:caption
