        journey from humble beginnings to an American pop-culture icon. "The
        Happy Painter" reveals the public and private sides of Bob Ross through
        loving accounts from close friends and family, childhood photographs and
        rare archival footage. Interviewees recount his gentle, mild-mannered
        demeanor and unwavering dedication to wildlife, and disclose
        little-known facts about his hair, his fascination with fast cars and
        more. Film clips feature Bob Ross with mentor William Alexander and the
        rough-cut of the first "Joy of Painting" episode from 1982. Famous Bob
        Ross enthusiasts, including talk-show pioneer Phil Donahue, film stars
        Jane Seymour and Terrence Howard, chef Duff Goldman and country music
        favorites Brad Paisley and Jerrod Niemann, provide fascinating insights
        into the man, the artist and his legacy.</image:caption
