        >A young man and woman are Facebook friends, they donâ€™t know each other
        but continue to be in touch. They both fall in love not knowing they are
        the same friends on FB with fictitious identity. Somewhere along the
        line, the man comes to know the woman he loves is the same person who is
        his best friend on FB, yet he refrains from revealing his identity. Why
        he does that drives the entire plot to its finale.</image:caption
