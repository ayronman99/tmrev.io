        >When the Spanish Civil War came to an end, Manuel Cortes was unable to
        flee the country. After a long journey, he managed to get back home in
        the dark without being discovered. His wife, Juliana, told him how the
        winning forces were shooting many of their fellow citizens. Manuel and
        Juliana decided to dig a small hole in the wall for Manuel to hide in.
        He could not even begin to imagine that this small hideaway was to
        become his private jail for the following 30 years. This is the story of
        the so-called post-war moles, people who had to put their lives on hold
        in order to escape from the repression imposed by the victors of the
        civil war.</image:caption
