        >"An Affirmative Act" is pro-gay marriage film, starring Charles
        Durning, Eric Etebari, Costas Mandylor, Rachael Robbins, and Blanche
        Baker, about a lesbian couple where one pretends to be a man in order
        for the two to get married and equal benefits. A slice of life of a
        young, professional married couple with their darling baby turns a
        sharp, dark corner when the pair are arrested and charged with several
        counts of fraud. The reason: Terry and Samantha Succi aren't the man and
        woman that they purported to be... Terry and Samantha married under
        false pretenses, ignoring state law that discriminates against
        homosexual partners and prohibits them from receiving the same rights
        and benefits as their straight counterparts.</image:caption
