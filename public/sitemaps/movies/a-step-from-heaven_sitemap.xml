        >Juan Angel Ruiz suffered a tragic accident that left his life and
        health in permanent risk but his spirit untouched. Over the past 14
        years he has learned that true happiness and hope lies within and began
        sharing this knowledge with thousands of people trough conferences and
        writing, becoming a highly condecorated Social Activist. His message was
        simple: love and enjoy life. After his second encounter with death, his
        health began deteriorating making it hard for Juan to continue his
        conferences and mission. Juan Angel reached out for a helping hand and a
        few years later Eduardo Verastegui, who had recently given a positive
        significance to his cinematographic work, met him and promised to take
        his message to the world. Eduardo traveled to Miami and met with Gloria
        and Emilio Estefan who related perfectly to the situation because of
        their own stories of adversity and hope. They decide to participate in
        Juan Angel's last public conference changing life and fate for
        ever.</image:caption
