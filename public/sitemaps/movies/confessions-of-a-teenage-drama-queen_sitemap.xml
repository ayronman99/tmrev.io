        >When the teenager Lola Steppe moves with her mother and sisters from
        New York to the suburb of Dellwood, New Jersey, she has the feeling that
        her cultural and entertaining world ended. While in school, the
        displaced Lola becomes close friend of the unpopular Ella, who is also a
        great fan of the her favorite rock band Sidarthur. However, the most
        popular girl in the school, Carla, disputes the lead role in an
        adaptation of Pygmalion with Lola and also the leadership of their
        mates. When the last concert of Sidarthur is sold-out, Lola plans with
        Ella to travel to New York and buy the tickets from scalpers. However,
        the girls get into trouble while helping the lead singer and Lola's idol
        Stu Wolf, changing their lives forever.</image:caption
