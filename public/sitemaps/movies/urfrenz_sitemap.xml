        >When depressed and withdrawn Catharine meets a secretive boy online,
        she begins to come out of her shell. But is he a suitor or a stalker, a
        friend or foe? The mystery of his existence fuels obsession, denial and
        deceit, sending her to the point of no return. In the midst of cliques,
        boyfriends, and digital drama, Catharine is trying to make sense of a
        world of uncertain identities. The film was inspired by the
        writer-director's own experience parenting his teenage daughter in the
        world of cyberspace. @urFRENZ was made to serve as a talking point for
        the subject matter of bullying and cyberbullying, the number one hot
        button issue between parents and teens today.</image:caption
