        >1 Giant Leap is a concept band and media project consisting of the two
        principal artists, Jamie Catto and Duncan Bridgeman. This is the film
        part of their first project. The result is a flowing, loose-knit
        tapestry of imagery, interviews, and diverse performances. Gathering
        material from 25 countries and dozens of famous and not-so-famous
        musicians, authors, celebrities, spiritualists, philosophers, and unique
        individuals from nearly every cultural background, this enveloping DVD
        is best enjoyed as a soothing audiovisual odyssey (select "loop mode"
        for continuous play!). Assembling this cornucopia by theme (Time,
        Inspiration, Sex, God, Death, etc.), Bridgeman and Catto function as
        co-composers with an astonishing array of collaborators, giving 1 Giant
        Leap its richly international (and some might say inter-spiritual)
        identity. The result is a far-reaching glimpse of our world through the
        eyes of those who improve it by their musical presence. --Jeff
