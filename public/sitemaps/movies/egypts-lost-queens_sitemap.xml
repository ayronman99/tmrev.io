        >Professor Joann Fletcher explores what it was like to be a woman of
        power in ancient Egypt. Through a wealth of spectacular buildings,
        personal artefacts and amazing tombs, Joann brings to life four of
        ancient Egypt's most powerful female rulers and discovers the remarkable
        influence wielded by women, whose power and freedom was unique in the
        ancient world. Throughout Egypt's history, women held the title of
        pharaoh no fewer than 15 times, and many other women played key roles in
        running the state and shaping every aspect of life. Joann Fletcher puts
        these influential women back at the heart of our understanding,
        revealing the other half of ancient Egypt.</image:caption
