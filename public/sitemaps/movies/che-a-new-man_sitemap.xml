        >The latest documentary by Tristan Bauer took 12 years to complete. It
        is a unique and invaluable historical document—a jewel not to be
        missed—that offers us a different, more intimate and personal,
        perspective on the life of Ernesto Che Guevara than other films about
        him that have emerged recently. Presenting brilliantly edited archival
        material, including private documents and intimate recordings that have
        never been made available to the public before (including recordings of
        Che reading poems by Vallejo and Neruda to his wife, intimate family
        gatherings on 8mm, a speech given by Che in French), Bauer allows us to
        see the iconic figure as a hero but also as the larger-than-life
        passionate and idealistic human being that he was.</image:caption
