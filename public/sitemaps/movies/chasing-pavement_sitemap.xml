        >Chasing Pavement stars Remy Mars as Elijah Young, an 'urban' porn star
        who is preparing to leave the adult entertainment industry and start a
        new career as a chef. His new roommate, Takeshi, played by Tokio Sasaki,
        is a Japanese immigrant who is looking for a new start in the
        information technology field. Takeshi, who feels completely invisible in
        the United States, becomes obsessed with his extremely visible flatmate.
        Takeshi's obsession culminates in a violation of boundaries that brings
        the two together for a moment of intimacy that neither will soon forget.
        The movie also stars Antonio Biaggi as Bryson Colon, a man with a
        troubled past who frequently hires Elijah as an escort, but wants much
        more.</image:caption
