        >Grace Rhodes, who is studying to be a doctor, returns to her hometown
        as a strange illness is afflicting the local children. The symptoms
        include a high fever and spasms, but even weirder is what happens the
        next day: All those with the illness claim they are somebody else --
        then they begin murdering the grown-ups. After her sister undergoes the
        same sinister metamorphosis, Grace comes to believe there is some
        connection to an evil cult figure who may be returning from the
        grave.</image:caption
