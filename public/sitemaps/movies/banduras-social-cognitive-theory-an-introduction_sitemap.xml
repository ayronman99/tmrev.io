        >Treading new ground in the field of social psychology, Albert Bandura’s
        work has become basic to an understanding of how social forces influence
        individuals, small groups and large groups. From his early BoBo doll
        experiments through his work with phobias, to his recent work on
        self-efficacy, Bandura has given us a sense of how people actively shape
        their own lives and those of others. Utilizing archival materials and
        newly shot visuals, students will be introduced to the vocabulary and
        innovative methods of this influential thinker. Dr. Bandura’s narration
        imbues this video with his compelling presentation style and
        intellectual authority.</image:caption
