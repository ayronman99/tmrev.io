        >When freeloader Phil is tossed out by the love of his life, Jen, he
        stays with two old friends who come upon a magic shirt that guarantees
        them sex with all the women they can handle. The three losers have their
        lives upended as Phil's friends pursue a daily diet of Maxim models and
        close encounters with Hollywood's hottest-but Phil schemes to use the
        shirt to win back Jen. And when an insane marine steals the shirt and
        threatens to use it on Jen, Phil's battle for her affections takes on
        dangerously high stakes. Chick Magnet makes it clear that the laws of
        attraction were made to be broken.</image:caption
