        >On October 22nd, 1966, Jenny Sims returned to her home on 641 Muriel
        Court from a night of babysitting. Upon her return, she found her
        mother, father, and 12-year-old sister bound, gaged, shot, and stabbed
        in the back bedroom. That night marked an abrupt transition for the
        residents of Tallahassee, Florida: door locks were sold out, gun stores
        were emptied, and people no longer felt safe or trusting of their
        neighbors. To date, no charges have been pressed for the murder of
        Helen, Robert, and Joy Sims. The 50-year investigation has uncovered a
        series of interesting suspects, none of which have been formally
        cleared. This film covers all five, including a never-before-seen police
        interview with one suspect from 1987, and an interview with her
        ex-husband filmed in the summer of 2016.</image:caption
