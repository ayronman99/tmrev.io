        >Written by Liu Zhenyun, based on his own novel of the same title, the
        film revolves around two successful men whose marriages were wrecked
        when their wives uncovered their extramarital affairs through traces
        left in their cellphones. More broadly, the film explores the role of
        cellphones in interpersonal relationships in modern China, where the
        rapid development in information technology is having huge impacts on
        the way people communicate.</image:caption
