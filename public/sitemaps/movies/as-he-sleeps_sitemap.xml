        >In sickness and in health, should marriage really be an unconditional
        partnership that should never be broken? Christina, in her 30's, is
        married to Hector, a husband who's paralyzed and therefore physically
        incompetent to consummate their marriage. She wants to liberate herself
        from a sexless union. Her needs as a woman are unfulfilled. But her love
        for Hector, and her commitment to him coupled with the dictates of her
        faith and marital vows, and her sympathy and care for her husband keeps
        her in "cage of marriage," where she suffers in melancholic solitude,
        yet contemplates on freedom and rediscovering her true worth. - Written
