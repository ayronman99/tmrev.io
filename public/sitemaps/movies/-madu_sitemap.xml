        >Azlan (Saiful Apek), a chalet worker in Bagan Lalang, receives an
        envelope requesting him to go to a law firm in Kuala Lumpur. Upon
        arrival, he is surprised to discover that he has a twin brother named
        Azrul, whom he meets for the first time. The reason they are gathered is
        because of their late-father's will, which states certain requirements
        that needs to be fulfilled in order for them to inherit RM50 million.
        Among the odd requests listed is that they must get married to their
        first wife within three months and make sure their second wife was an
        orphaned child.</image:caption
