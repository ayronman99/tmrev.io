        >“Breaking Myths” aims to open the world’s eyes to the fragile and
        “catastrophic masculinity” of Brazil’s current President Jair Bolsonaro,
        a fanatical far-right politician who can best be described as the
        Brazilian Donald Trump — and who is up for a second term this October.
        The story is told through the lens of the critically acclaimed Brazilian
        filmmaker and LGBTQ activist Fernando Grostein Andrade (“Abe” Sundance
        19), who directed, wrote, and produced the feature alongside creative
        partner Fernando Siqueira as the first release under his production
        company in California, FilmSoul Studios.</image:caption
