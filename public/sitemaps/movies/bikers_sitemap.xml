        >Insufficient brothers Jakub and David, along with friend Sasa, spend
        most of their time in the social networking world. Relationships for
        them are chat with virtual girls they have never seen, living a fake
        fashion show in which they pretend something that is not the biggest
        life problem, then a discharged cell phone or a broken wifi. The
        pressure of parents is forced to go under the leadership of David's
        charming "stepmother" Tereza on a twenty-kilometer bicycle trip,
        surprisingly finding out there is a real world out there in which life
        means more than facebook status, real girls look a little better than
        cartoon action heroes of virtual games and love also include
        sex.</image:caption
