        >The film opens with Jade Leung kills a few people - but when she
        accidentally threaten a young boy in the process in a square where she
        tries to save him, thereby allowing sufficient time for the police to
        arrest her and send her to imprisonment. There is a focus not only on
        her, she shares it with three other prisoners as she slowly befriends,
        and each of them given her own story and flashback on how she got
        there.</image:caption
