        >Jack Richards, a professor in his 50's, has apparently gone mad over
        the supposed abduction of his daughter by a sinister cult. Wallowing in
        self-pity for years, he decides to commit suicide. However, the manner
        in which he decides to suicide is quite peculiar: he allows himself to
        be abducted by a cult, whose members treat him as their "king" for one
        year (he is given a castle, concubines, gifts, etc...), and then murder
        him as an atonement for their yearly sins.</image:caption
