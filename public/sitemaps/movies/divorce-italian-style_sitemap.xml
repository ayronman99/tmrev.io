        >Ferdinando Cefal√π is desperate to marry his cousin, Angela, but he is
        married to Rosalia and divorce is illegal in Italy. To get around the
        law, he tries to trick his wife into having an affair so he can catch
        her and murder her, as he knows he would be given a light sentence for
        killing an adulterous woman. He persuades a painter to lure his wife
        into an affair, but Rosalia proves to be more faithful than he
        expected.</image:caption
