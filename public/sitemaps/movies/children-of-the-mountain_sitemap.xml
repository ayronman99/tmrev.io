        >Against the picturesque Ghanaian backdrop, Children of the Mountain is
        an honest exploration of a mother’s will in the face of much adversity.
        When her baby is born with a cleft lip, cerebral palsy, and Down
        syndrome, Essuman is led to believe that she has a ‘dirty womb.’ Her
        promising future as a wife and mother is shattered as her lover disowns
        her and the community eyes her with suspicion.</image:caption
