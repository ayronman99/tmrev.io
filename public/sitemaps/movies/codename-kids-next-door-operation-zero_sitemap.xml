        >The villains of the Kids Next Door, lead by Father, join forces to
        resurrect the Ultimate Evil, Grandfather, a tyrant who once ruled the
        world many years ago when most of the villains were themselves kids.
        However, Father disgraced him that he can't even try to destroy the KND
        and the Villains were quickly betrayed when they are turned into Senior
        Citizombies, creatures that are immortal and can transform any living
        creature into one of them and slaves who are forced to make Tapioca to
        refuel Grandfather so he can find and destroy the Book of
        K.N.D.</image:caption
