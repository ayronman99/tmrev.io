        cohabitation with men closer to each other in a possible fate of death
        and suffering: officers and enlisted men had the opportunity to give and

        story of dramatic conflict, through letters, diaries and photographs
        taken by the fighters, and collected in the book that Lucio Fabi has
        derived from his research, The good soldier mule (ed. MURSIA). A
        documentary rebuild memories, stories, episodes of real life
        relationship, in and out of the trench, between humans and animals,
        including incredible moments of absolute serenity and tenderness,
        alternating the background of one of the most tragic periods in modern
        history.</image:caption
