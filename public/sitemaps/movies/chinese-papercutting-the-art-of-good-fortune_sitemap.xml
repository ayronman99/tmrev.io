        >Perennially popular in China, paper-cutting is treasured for its
        ability to transform ordinary paper into intricately patterned,
        brilliantly colored works of art. This program, filmed in Hubei
        Province, charts the evolution of Chinese paper-cutting from traditional
        cutouts representing luck and health to modern visual art as it
        illustrates the designing, cutting, and coloring processes. Tsuwoo Wi,
        whose father was the only apprentice of the great Master Wang Lao Shang,
        is featured, along with Tsuwoo Tsuing, of Central Art College,
        Beijing.</image:caption
