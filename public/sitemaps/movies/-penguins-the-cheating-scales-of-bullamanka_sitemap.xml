        >Foul play is afoot on space-base Bullamanka. The conniving Lizard King
        has defeated the kindly Bandicoot King in a bizarre local game called
        "Squid-Tac-Toad!" But did he play by the rules? Michelle tries to beat
        the Lizard King at his own game. Can she keep the Bandicoot King - and
        her penguins friends - from going down the "gurgler"? What is a
        "gurgler," anyway? In this wild adventure filled with action, intrigue,
        Red-Naped Ibs and Yellow-Capped Whopper Dingys, you and your family will
        learn why God likes it when we play by the rules.</image:caption
