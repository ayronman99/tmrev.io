        >The story of Heidi Fleiss, known as "The Hollywood Madam", who was the
        daughter of a prominent Los Angeles doctor and eventually became a
        prostitute for a well-known Los Angeles madam. She took over her boss'
        operation and soon was raking in $300,000 a month by hiring only the
        most beautiful and highest-class hookers and catering to wealthy
        Hollywood types, European and American corporate executives and Arab
        sheiks. Her operation was broken up by Los Angeles police in 1993, and
        she eventually went to prison for income-tax evasion.</image:caption
