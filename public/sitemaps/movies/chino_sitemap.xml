        >Chino Valdez is a loner horse breeder living in the old west. Partly a
        loner by choice, and partly because, being a 'half-breed', he finds
        himself unwelcome almost everywhere he goes. One day, a young runaway
        named Jimmy shows up at his door looking for work and a roof over his
        head. Reluctantly, Chino agrees to take him in and teach him the art of
        raising, breaking and breeding horses, until the pair finally begin to
        accept each other.</image:caption
