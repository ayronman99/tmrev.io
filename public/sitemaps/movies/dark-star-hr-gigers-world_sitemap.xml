        >He feels at home in places we would flee from and lives his life among
        the very things we fear. Throughout his life, HR Giger had inhabited the

        charting our nightmares, drafting maps of our subconscious and molding
        our primal fears. A film with and about the internationally acclaimed
        and controversial painter, sculptor, architect and designer (Oscar for
        'Alien').</image:caption
