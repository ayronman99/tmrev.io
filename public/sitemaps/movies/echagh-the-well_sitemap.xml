        >Echagh (The Well) is a research film on a Tuareg Fraction called
        Igorareine. They live in a locality called Echgah situated to 40 km in
        the northest from Gao, nothern Mali. They basically look after sheep,
        goats, camels, cattle, and have been practising a nomadic life for
        generations. Nowadays, some of them are about to leave this ancestral
        way of life due to many loss of animals caused by the desertification of
        the Sahara. That is how they settled in the surrounding of a colonial
        well, called Echgh in 1988. A decade later, they created a primary
        school for their children. Since then, they are thinking about another
        way of life. But it should be noticed that this newly introduced school
        system is subject of many interpretations in Echagh. Some of them
        believes in other opportunities that school may bring about. In contrast
        others see it as a device which threatens their traditional way of life.
        Within such a divergent context, the film explores the life choices of
        three kids.</image:caption
