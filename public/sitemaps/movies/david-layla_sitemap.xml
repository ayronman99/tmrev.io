        >Inspired by a true story, sparks fly when a Jew and a Muslim fall in
        love in New York. David (David Moscow), TV host of "Sex &amp;
        Happiness", becomes smitten with the voluptuous Layla (Shiva Rose) - a
        mysterious, sensual dancer who turns out to be a refugee. David's
        reckless pursuit of Layla sets off an unveiling of the similarities and
        contrasts of their ancient cultures. His lust grows into love as he
        discovers in stunning Layla a sensitive, intelligent war survivor with a
        rich culture that echoes his own. But their families are dead set
        against their unlikely romance. Faced with deportation, Layla must
        choose.</image:caption
