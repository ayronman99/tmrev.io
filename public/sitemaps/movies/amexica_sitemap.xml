        >AMEXICA is the story of a young boy from Mexico who is sold by a human
        trafficking ring to two con artists from Los Angeles with a get rich
        scheme. They portray him as their son, extorting money from innocent
        people by risking the boy's life in staged automobile accidents.
        Trapped, alone with his captors, and unable to speak for himself, the
        boy decides to take his fate into his own hands, forever changing the
        lives of the people around him. Amexica takes a different approach in
        the exploration of human trafficking, showing the unexpected fallout of
        human chemistry from the captors and the victim's point of
        view.</image:caption
