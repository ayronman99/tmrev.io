        >The King of Bali invites Chhota Bheem and his friends to attend the
        coronation of the state's prince. After reaching Bali, Bheem and his
        friends find that the state is captured by a witch named Rangda who
        wants to rule the country. Rangda is very powerful and has Leyaks,
        magical creatures, as her army. She arrests the king and queen of Bali,
        but, with the assistance of Chhota Bheem and his friends, the young
        prince of Bali manages to escape. Now, Chhota Bheem and his friends
        attempt to save the people of Bali from Rangda's black magic. Meanwhile
        Rangda causes destruction and diseases in Bali with her magical power.
        Two little Indonesian village girls Aci and Ayu help Bheem and his
        friends to save Bali from Rangda.</image:caption
