        >"Poetic documentary about the prominent Russian poet Arseny Tarkovsky
        (1907/1989), father of director Andrei Tarkovsky. Arseny Tarkovsky
        translated countless poems from Georgian, Arabic, Armenian, Kyrghyz,
        Polish etc., but many of his own poems were also translated into other
        languages. The maker of the documentary, Viatcheslav Amirchanian, cared
        for Arseny Tarkovsky in the last years of the poet's life, shot many
        hours of film in that period, took countless photographs and, years
        later, he combined this with other material to form this documentary.
        Tarkovsky Sr, who was admired by colleagues such as Joseph Brodsky, Anna
        Achmatova and Marina Cvetaeva, was never published during the Stalin
        era, even though he had lost a leg as a soldier at the front. His first
        book (Before the Snow) only appeared in 1962 during the thaw under
        Khrushchev." - IFFR</image:caption
