        >Since Six was 18, he no longer knows what freedom is. He’s trapped in a
        wheelchair. His father, a taxi driver, drives him every day out to the
        streets to sell chewing gum. That’s how Six spends his days. Till he
        gets to meet a quiet girl, Noodles, who always shuts herself away in a
        small stationery store. Six barges into her world. He adds a touch of
        pheromone to the colorful but icy stationery store. Suddenly, everything
        becomes interesting.</image:caption
