        >Jessie Valiquette follows her scribe boyfriend of 3 years Dale Morrow
        on a search for his long lost Father last heard from on a deserted
        island in the Philippines. Along with a group of unwitting friends, the
        young couple encounters more than they bargained for when they discover
        not only was Dale's father part of a top-secret government project
        testing the depth of people's fears, but also that he had very good
        reason for not wanting to be found. Written by In-Motion
