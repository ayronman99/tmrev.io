        >This remarkable animated documentary traces the unconventional
        upbringing of the filmmaker Jung Henin, one of thousands of Korean
        children adopted by Western families after the end of the Korean War. It
        is the story of a boy stranded between two cultures. Animated vignettes
        – some humorous and some poetic – track Jung from the day he first meet
        his new blond siblings, through elementary school, and into his teenage
        years, when his emerging sense of identity begins to create fissures at
        home and ignite the latent biases of his adoptive parents. The filmmaker
        tells his story using his own animation intercut with snippets of
        super-8 family footage and archival film. The result is an animated
        memoir like no other: clear-eyed and unflinching, humorous, and above
        all, inspiring in the capacity of the human heart.</image:caption
