        >The Babes in the Wood Murders were the murders of two nine-year-old
        girls, Nicola Fellows and Karen Hadaway, on 9 October 1986, by a
        20-year-old local roofer, Russell Bishop in Brighton, England. Bishop
        was tried and acquitted in 1987. The case remained openuntil 10 December
        2018, when Bishop was found guilty of the murders in a second trial. The
        investigation into the two girls' murders is the largest and
        longest-running inquiry ever conducted by Sussex Police. With exclusive
        access to police tapes, this is the remarkable story of how police
        finally brought a child killer to justice after thirty-two
        years.</image:caption
