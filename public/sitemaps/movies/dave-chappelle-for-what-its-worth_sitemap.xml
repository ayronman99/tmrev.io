        >Comedian Dave Chappelle does what he does best in this outrageous and
        hilarious standup performance, which allows him to push the envelope far
        beyond what he does on his TV show. Taped in San Francisco at the famed
        Fillmore, Chappelle lets loose on such topics as black celebrities, what
        it's like to have raunchy fans of his TV show approach him while he's
        trying to enjoy Disneyland with his kids, Michael Jackson, Kobe
        Bryant... and crackheads, of course. It's comedy Chappelle-style and,
        for what it's worth, no one is safe from his barbs. But you already knew
        that!</image:caption
