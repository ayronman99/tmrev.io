        >After years of serving in the army and drifting across the Amazon,
        Loeti yearns to go back to his land, to find his roots, and be amongst
        his people, the Aluku, the first Maroons of French Guiana and Suriname.
        One night, due to a crackdown on illegal gold mining, Loeti is forced to
        flee the site where he is working. Lost in the Amazon forest, he must
        use what is left of his childhood knowledge of the forest, to find his
        way back and combat the many deadly perils that lurk with every step. He
        is guided by the spirits, the animals, a compass, and his prayers. An
        intense reunion confronts Loeti with a changing world where old
        traditions and values are both challenged and influenced by the invading
        modern world. Loeti must deal with his past and grapple with what
        remains of the Aluku's ancient African customs by immersing himself in
        their magical world.</image:caption
