        >Jake, a college drop out, along with his friends decide to take their
        homophobia to a whole other level when when they decide to download a
        gay oriented social media app where they would lure and attack innocent
        victims. Noah, a just coming to terms gay teen, doesn't know who to talk
        to about his feelings and turns to the same social media app the
        attackers use on their prey. Told from both perspectives of the main
        characters and a chilling conclusion that will alter everyone's lives
        forever.</image:caption
