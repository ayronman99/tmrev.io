        >This Is Where I Came In is the Bee Gees' 22nd and final studio album
        (twentieth worldwide), released in 2001. It is the only album of all-new
        material released by them on the Universal Music label (which had
        acquired the rights to the group's releases on Polydor Records when they
        bought that label's parent PolyGram). The album peaked at #6 in the UK,
        while the single, "This Is Where I Came In", reached #18. In the US, the
        album peaked at #16. The group appeared on the A&amp;E concert series
        Live by Request in April, 2001 to promote the new album.</image:caption
