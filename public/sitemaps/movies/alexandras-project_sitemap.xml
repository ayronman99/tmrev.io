        >Steve is a man who has it all, a successful career, wonderful children,
        beautiful home and a loving wife. However, returning to his home after
        work on his birthday, he finds his house deserted and darkened with
        almost all the lightbulbs missing, all easy access outside cut off and a
        videotape waiting for him. Playing that tape, he watches a bizarre and
        grueling recording in which his wife explains her grievance with him,
        her reasons for disappearing with the children and her revenge for how
        he treated her in a way he would never forget.</image:caption
