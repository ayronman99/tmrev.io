        >Dummie has homesickness. He wants to go back to Egypt to seek the grave
        of his parents so that he can say goodbye to them. Klaas sees that trip
        is not going to be easy. He finds flying to Egypt scary, it costs way
        too much money and Dummie has no passport. But if Dummie's painting by
        Miss Friek is sold for a large amount and he can organise a passport,
        then can Klaas, Goos, Dummie and Miss Friek leave for Egypt. But is the
        Tomb of Achnetoet still available after four thousand years? With a plan
        by Master Drab, Dummie and Goos are investigating. But the search is
        full of dangers and the best friends walk into a trap. Can Klaas save
        them on time or keep Dummie and Goos captive forever?</image:caption
