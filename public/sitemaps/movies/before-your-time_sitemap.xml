        >After the loss of their mother, 17-year-old Dylan, his two sisters, and
        father are forced to move back to the small town where their parents met
        and grew up. While getting back on their feet, the family stays with
        their eccentric Aunt Norah and tries to adjust to a new life. They meet
        a quirky neighborhood kid, Pete, who convinces them to embark on a
        "bucket-list" type adventure inspired by a list found in their Dad's
        high school storage boxes. The task is not as easy as it seems and
        ultimately teaches everyone about managing grief, moving forward, and
        the importance of family.</image:caption
