        >In 1994, real-life crop artist Stan Herd traveled from Kansas to
        Manhattan's Upper West Side to create a massive environmental artwork on
        land owned by Donald Trump. The multi-acre artwork was made from soil,
        rock, plants and vegetation near an underground railway tunnel. Stan
        recruited a number of homeless individuals living in the tunnel to
        become his crew. Over the months it took to complete the earthwork, Stan
        dealt with a myriad of difficulties in bringing his unique, rural art
