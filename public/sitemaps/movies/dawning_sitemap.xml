        >When Chris and Aurora Benton travel north to visit their father and
        step-mother, they expect a normal weekend of boredom and small talk.
        What the siblings don't know is that a creature has been wreaking havoc
        on the local wildlife and farm animals, creating a volatile situation
        for all parties involved. When their parents do not come home after
        their first night in the cabin, Chris and Aurora's minds begin to break
        down and tension builds. As the night draws nearer and unseen
        responsibilities mount, hope becomes harder and harder to come by...if
        only they can hold out until the dawn. Shot in the style of an
        observational documentary, slowly morphs into a gritty, stylized
        suspense picture.</image:caption
