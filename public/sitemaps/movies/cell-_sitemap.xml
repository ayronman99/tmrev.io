        >Cocky young attorney Michael Gray finds himself framed for murder when
        an inmate he is defending violently kills himself during their interview
        at South River State Penitentiary. Now locked in the same nightmarish
        Cell 213 where his client died, he soon realizes that unnatural forces
        are behind a string of inmate suicides, making matters of guilt and
        innocence not as cut and dry as they seem.</image:caption
