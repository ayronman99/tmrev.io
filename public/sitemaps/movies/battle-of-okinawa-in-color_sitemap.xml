        >By mid-1945, Hitler is dead and the war has ended in Europe. Halfway
        around the world, however, the fighting is still going strong on a small
        island in the Pacific. Okinawa was the site of the last battle of the
        last great war of the 20th century, with a casualty rate in the tens of
        thousands. Through it all, military cameramen risked their lives to film
        the conflict, from brutal land combat to fierce kamikaze attacks at sea.
        See the footage they captured and experience this intense battle the way
