        >On a break from his pushy girlfriend, a male falls for the sister of
        his employer. Based in Malad West, Mumbai, Sameer lives a middle-classed
        lifestyle along with his live-in rather pushy girlfriend, Shikha, who
        constantly questions and nags him several times during the day. He is
        employed with a Bollywood film distribution firm owned by Rajan Mehra.
        When Shikha decides to visit her family in Indore, he is relieved and
        decides to live it up. Things look up for him when Rajan hires his
        gorgeous sister, Sanjana, to work with him. Both soon become close, and
        she accepts his proposal for marriage despite of being aware that he is
        in a relationship. Watch what impact this news has on
        Shikha.</image:caption
