        >Part 2 (of three) of "Chicago: City of the Century" covers the 1870s
        and '80s, when the city's can-do business leaders found themselves
        increasingly at odds with labor. The episode profiles meatpacker
        Augustus Swift; sleeping-car magnate George Pullman, who established
        what he hoped would become a utopian workers community; and merchant
        prince Marshall Field, who had no such notions. Then there were the
        anarchists. Based on the book by historian Donald L.
        Miller.</image:caption
