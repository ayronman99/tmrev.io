        >A 12-yr-old boy picks up a country made gun &amp; shoots a man in cold
        blood! His eyes show no emotion. His heart exhibits no remorse. After
        shooting the person in broad day light, this boy walked the streets of
        Aman Ganj, with a gun in one hand. Everyone present in the market
        watched this young lad walk with no fear. The fear in fact had
        translated, from him into everyone's heart. He made his
        Mark!!!</image:caption
