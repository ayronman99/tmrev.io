        >"Be Still" is an extraordinary film that demonstrates contemplative
        prayer as a vital part of our everyday lives and as a remedy for the
        ills of the frenzied, fast paced modern world. Featuring interviews with
        some of today's most highly respected authors, educators, and ministers,
        like Dr. Henry Cloud, Dallas Willard, Max Lucado, and Beth Moore, "Be
        Still" examines the importance of silent reflective prayer as a way to
        truly be open to receiving God's guidance. This remarkable film also
        features a useful "how to" section that shows how contemplative prayer
        can be used by anyone at any time to better one's life and reaffirm that
        which is truly important.</image:caption
