        >Shigematsu Shizuma lives with his senile mother, his wife Shigeko, and
        his niece Yasuko in a village near Fukuyama. He, his wife, his niece and
        his close friends in the village were present at the atomic bombing of
        Hiroshima. The Shizumas look for prospective husbands for Yasuko, but
        find that the families withdraw on finding out she was at
        Hiroshima.</image:caption
