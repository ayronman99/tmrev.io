        >Country Boys is a 6-hour documentary film centered on Cody Perkins and
        Chris Johnson, two teenage boys from David, Kentucky. They attended the
        David School, a non-denominational alternative high school with a
        mission to serve underprivileged and struggling students. The film
        covers the 3-year period from 1999 to 2002 in which the boys' ages range
        from 15 to 18. It was directed by David Sutherland. It was a three-part
        edition of Frontline on PBS, with each part running for two hours,
        originally broadcast in January 2006.</image:caption
