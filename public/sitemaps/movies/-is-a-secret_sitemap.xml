        >"Renwick recounts a sad time in her life, when a friend was dying and
        she suddenly became aware of the presence of crows. The dark birds in
        turn point her to the practice of counting crows, which is both a
        children's rhyming game and a form of divination in which the number of
        crows suggests events in the future. Eight crows augur death: nine crows
        reference a secret. Renwick combines these fragments with glimpses of
        imagery - a bed, the crows captures as silhouettes, a man's twisted body
        - to craft a lyrical and moving essay that works its magic through
        poetic accretion rather than narrative logic." -Holly Willis, L.A.
