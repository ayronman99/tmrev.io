        >Cass and Mark are a couple on a camping trip to the distant
        countryside. When their seemingly secluded getaway is interrupted by an
        ominous scream, they start to think someone might be stalking them, and
        encounter two strangers who are also in the woods near them. Despite
        everything appearing to be harmless, they canâ€™t shake the feeling that
        something is wrong. The truth, however, is far more disturbing than
        meets the eye.</image:caption
