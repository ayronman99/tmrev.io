        >Blood on the Carpet is an arthouse musical film written and produced by
        Bladde. The film follows a lonely character braving a steep mountain
        attempting to reach its peak. As he journeys the mountain, he is forced
        to confront a plethora of internal demons. Blood on the Carpet is the
        debut film work of Bladde, blending together performance art drag
        elements with arthouse horror qualities. The film features music from a
        variety of artists and genres including a recurring score borrowed from
        the work of composer Jacob Abrams.</image:caption
