        >The police raid a theatre where movie tickets of a very successful film
        are being sold in black (illegally at a higher price). When Police
        Inspector Sher Khan interrogates Khoji, a man in his 20s, he claims that
        he is the director of the very film whose tickets he is selling in
        black. The cynical Sher Khan puts Khoji behind bars. Now Sher Khan
        receives two phone calls -- one from the Police Commissioner and another
        from the dreaded don "WC", both of whom support Khoji's detention. Who
        is Khoji? Is he really the film's director? Then why is he selling his
        film's tickets in black? What do the Police Commissioner and don "WC"
        want from Khoji? All this is revealed through a hilarious turn of
        events.</image:caption
