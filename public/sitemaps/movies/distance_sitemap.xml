        >Three stories which each focus on one of three types of relationships:
        family, friendship, and love. The first story is about conflicted
        manager on a business trip who is intrigued by an elderly worker and
        investigates his life. The second story is about a young father who
        receives a letter that brings him to a foreign land, where old emotions
        come unburied. The last story is about a visiting professor from
        overseas who sets a student's heart fluttering, while having to deal
        with his own.</image:caption
