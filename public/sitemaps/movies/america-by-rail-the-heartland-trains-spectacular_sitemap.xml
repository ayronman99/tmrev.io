        >The cross-country train epic is now on DVD! A coast-to-coast trip from
        Washington, DC to San Francisco aboard Amtrak's Capitol Limited and
        California Zephyr. See our nation's capitol, lush Ohio Amish Farmlands,

        the following steam and diesel tourist railroads: Strasburg Railroad,
        Potomac Eagle, Western Maryland Scenic Railroad, Ohio Central, Boone &
        Scenic Valley, Omaha Zoo Railroad, Durango & Silverton, Heber valley,
        Virginia & Truckee, Napa Valley Wine Train, Roaring Camp & Big Trees,
        and Santa Cruz Trees & Pacific. Includes music composed especially for
        this program by noted television composer Micheal Lynch, as well as lots
        of natural train sounds.</image:caption
