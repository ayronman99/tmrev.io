        >Darius Weems, a 15-year-old with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, had never
        left his hometown of Athens, Georgia. In the summer of 2005, he and a
        group of young college students traveled across the country in a
        wheelchair-accessible RV to test accessibility in the United States.
        Their ultimate goal was to reach Los Angeles and convince MTV's hit
        show, "Pimp My Ride," to customize Darius's wheelchair. Along the way,
        they found joy, brotherhood, and the knowledge that life, even when
        imperfect, is always worth the ride.</image:caption
