        >EDDY'S WORLD is a fascinating portrait of a 98 year old working toy
        inventor. Best known for the iconic "chattering teeth" and 800 classic
        toys, he shares his passion for creativity and his philosophies of life
        and aging. Eddy lives in a retirement community and we follow him
        through his daily routine - working on new models in his garage machine
        shop, writing short stories on his computer, creating translucent
        lithophane portraits with his new 3D printer., walking and exercising.
        Eddy began designing toys on the Batfish Submarine during World War II.
        He is an endearing story teller who believes that optimism and new ideas
        keep him young and healthy.</image:caption
