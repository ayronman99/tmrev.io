        >Seongjong who history remembers, earns a reputation for appreciating
        the motto 'making the people feel comfortable and putting political
        affairs right'. He is known as the king who led his country in the most
        peaceful and steady way during the Joseon times. However, was Seongjong
        really a wise king? Seongjong was enthroned by Queen Jeong-hee, Queen
        In-soo, Han Myeong-hoi and his supporters. The 13-year-old king made 73
        of his supporters his retainers! Numerous noblemen were happy that he
        became king. However, some of his people had to cry blood because he
        became the king. "Is this country run by phantoms like you My Lord?"
        Seongjong, the puppet who dreamt of a reign of peace, wishes to behead
        the king who dominates the people!</image:caption
