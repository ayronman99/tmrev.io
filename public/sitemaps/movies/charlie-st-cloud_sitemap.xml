        >Accomplished sailor Charlie St. Cloud has the adoration of his mother
        Claire and his little brother Sam, as well as a college scholarship that
        will lead him far from his sleepy Pacific Northwest hometown. But his
        bright future is cut short when a tragedy strikes and takes his dreams
        with it. After his high-school classmate Tess returns home unexpectedly,
        Charlie grows torn between honoring a promise he made four years earlier
        and moving forward with newfound love. And as he finds the courage to
        let go of the past for good, Charlie discovers the soul most worth
        saving is his own.</image:caption
