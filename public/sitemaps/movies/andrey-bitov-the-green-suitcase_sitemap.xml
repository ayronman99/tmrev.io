        >"Andrey Bitov. The Green Suitcase" is the first portrait film in the
        work of Viktor Tikhomirov. Initially, the picture was supposed to
        reflect the process of writing the book "Chaos and Order", which was
        conceived by Andrey Bitov, and be called like a book. Later, due to
        objective reasons, the tape was transformed into a cinematic portrait of
        the writer, whose image is revealed through philosophical concepts:
        "chaos" and "order". The film features music by the groups "Volkovtrio"
        and "Auction". The film was awarded a special jury prize at the
        festival" Literature and Cinema " in Gatchina (2002).</image:caption
