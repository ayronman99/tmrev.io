        >When the powerful wizard, Lord Tensley, is jilted by Princess Ennogard,
        he vows to rid the land of love. He commands his fire-breathing dragon
        to destroy any sign of affection seen throughout the kingdom. As the
        death toll rises, Camilan, a brave but arrogant warrior seeks to marry
        his true love despite the curse upon the land. In order to fulfill his
        destiny, he seeks the help of his estranged brother Ramicus, a bounty
        hunter with no desire to get involved. It takes an enchanted distress
        message and the promise of great reward from the beautiful Princess
        Ennogard, to lure Ramicus into the quest to defeat the wizard and his
        terrible beast.</image:caption
