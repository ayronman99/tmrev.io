        >One night in the hottest summer in 20 years, Leandro De La Torre,
        famous punk singer, shoots out of a window and hits the roof of a car.
        It is the day of his 27th birthday. Paula, a young fan of twenty-one
        years old, records everything with her cell phone. Far from knowing that
        in that video is the key behind the murder of the musician. Mart√≠n
        Lombardo, a staunch supporter of Racing, is the detective in charge of
        investigating the case. Along with Paula you will discover the
        conspiracy behind the deaths of all famous rockers at 27 years old. Jimi
        Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Amy Winehouse, Sid Vicious and Leandro De La
        Torre have a lot in common: in fact, they were all murdered. Paula and
        Lombardo can be the following. Persecutions, impossible action scenes
        and completely unexpected twists make up the plot of 27.</image:caption
