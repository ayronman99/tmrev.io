        >Amanda believes men are too complicated and has lost faith finding the
        perfect one. Her friend and a psychoanalyst have a plan how to make her
        fall in love. She insists that Amanda not stay home alone on New Year's
        Eve, and only gets her way after swearing that all the other guests will
        be couples, except for Maxime, a gay colleague. But Maxime leaves at the
        last minute to join his lover in Amsterdam, and Antoine, recently
        separated from his wife, arrives alone at the party.</image:caption
