        >A lighthearted, feature-length documentary that explores what happens
        when four first-timers accept a challenge to ride naked on bicycles in
        Seattle’s legendary Fremont Solstice Parade. Through first-person
        footage of four audacious riders, and interviews with critics and fans,
        Beyond Naked explores our deep-rooted fear and awkward fascination with
        nakedness. Filmmakers Dan McComb and Lisa Cooper follow the four riders
        in the run up to the parade, uncovering their trepidations about, and
        motivations for riding naked. From nudist camp, to waxing spa, to the
        streets of Seattle’s quirky neighborhood called Fremont, audiences will
        experience the tensions and silliness at that arise at the intersection
        of public and private. Tastefully shot for a mainstream audience, the
        film will leave viewers inspired by the creative courage of those who
        are willing to dare more with less.</image:caption
