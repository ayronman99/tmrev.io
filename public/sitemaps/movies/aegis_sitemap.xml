        >The Isokaze, an Aegis-class escort vessel, sets sail on a routine
        training exercise, playing host to a platoon from the Fleet Training
        Group. No sooner is the Isokaze on open water, however, then the FTG
        reveal themselves to be terrorist stowaways who kill the ship's captain,
        send the rest of the crew overboard and take control of the vessel. The
        ship is carrying a secret biological weapon which the terrorists are now
        threatening to use to level Tokyo! Only a stowaway NCO, Sengoko (played
        by Sanada Hiroyuki from Ring and Twilight Samurai) is in a position to
        stop them - but does he really have what it takes to save the day?
        Playing like a cross between a sea-faring version of Top Gun and Die
        Hard, director Sakamoto Junji shows that it's not just Hollywood that
        can produce thrill-a-minute action spectaculars.</image:caption
