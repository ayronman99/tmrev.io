        >Between 1964 and 1966, Andy Warhol shot nearly 500 Screen Tests,
        beautiful and revealing portraits of hundreds of different individuals,
        from Warhol superstars and celebrities to friends or anyone he thought
        had "star potential". All visitors to his studio, the Factory. Subjects
        were captured in stark relief by a strong keylight, and filmed by Warhol
        with his stationary 16mm Bolex camera on silent, black and white,
        100-foot rolls of film. The resulting two-and-a-half-minute film reels
        were then screened in slow motion, resulting in a fascinating collection
        of four-minute masterpieces that startle and entrance, mesmerizing in
        the purest sense of the word. Songwriters Dean Wareham and Britta
        Phillips, formerly of the band Luna and currently recording as Dean &
        Britta, incorporated original compositions as well as cover songs to
        create new soundtracks for the 13 films.</image:caption
