        >Kôichi is a Japanese man living alone in Berlin. He has no job and
        hardly any friends. One night Kôichi meets Ryota at a bar which is also
        a sex club. Ryota came to Berlin to visit a German guy whom he had "met"
        on a dating app. His high hopes for romance (and marriage?) were quickly
        crushed since the German was only interested in sex, not even letting
        Ryota stay for the night. That is why Ryota ended up spending the night
        in the dark room of the sex club. Kôichi for some reason lets Ryota stay
        at his apartment. They have sex. Ryota goes out almost everyday to get
        laid by various local men and comes home to Kôichi's. Increasingly
        caught up with a strange feeling that is akin to but not quite
        frustration or curiosity (needless to say, it is not even close to
        love), Kôichi gradually gives himself up to sex with
        Ryota.</image:caption
