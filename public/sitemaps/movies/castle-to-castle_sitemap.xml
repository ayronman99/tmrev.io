        >Spring 2017, in between the two rounds of the French presidential
        election. Pierre, a 25-year-old scholarship holder studying in a big
        Parisian school, lives with 75-year-old Francine, who is disabled and
        wheelchair-bound. Politically and socially opposed, they are perplexed
        and disoriented as they witness the unfolding electoral spectacle. While
        waiting for the results, they engage with each other, as Pierre tries to
        take care of Francineâ€™s body and she attempts to heal his voiceless
        resentment.</image:caption
