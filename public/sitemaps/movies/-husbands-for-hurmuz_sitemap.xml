        film is about the adventures of flirtatious Hurmuz in late 1800's
        Istanbul. Hurmuz who lives in Taskasap, Istanbul has six husbands in a
        plot to solve her economic problems. She arranges to meet each of her

        the town's doctor whom she meets at her husband's barber shop. The
        doctor falls in love with her too... But, one night all six husbands
        come home at the same time, and Hurmuz and Safinaz - Hurmuz's
        "go-between/accomplice/friend" - find themselves in a series of very
