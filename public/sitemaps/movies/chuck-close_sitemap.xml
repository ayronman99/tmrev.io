        >Chuck Close, an astounding portrait of one of the world's leading
        contemporary painters, was one of two parting gifts (her second is a
        film on Louise Bourgeois) from Marion Cajori, a filmmaker who died
        recently, and before her time. With editing completed by filmmaker Ken
        Kobland, Chuck Close lives the life and work of a man who has reinvented
        portraiture. Close photographs his subjects, blows up the image to
        gigantic proportions, divides it into a detailed grid and then uses a
        complex set of colors and patterning to reconstruct each
        face.</image:caption
