        message that his only daughter has died in a car crash. Last time he saw
        his daughter was at his wife's funeral. When trying to deal with his
        daughter's affairs, he finds out he is a grandfather of a nine-year-old
        girl, named Saffron. Since he is her only relative, social services
        hands over Saffron to him. At first he tries to get rid of her, but he
        soon finds out that they share more than his daughter, Saffron's mother.
