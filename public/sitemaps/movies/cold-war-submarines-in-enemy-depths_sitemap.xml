        >The Cold War was a deadly game in the depths of the oceans. More than
        20 collisions between American and Soviet submarines are only the tip of
        the iceberg as far as these secret operations are concerned. The
        underwater interface was perhaps the most merciless frontier between
        East and West. This documentary reveals previously unknown information
        from the military apparatus of both sides, and shows that submarines
        continue to be an important weapon in the espionage war even
        today.</image:caption
