        >An Innuit hunter races his sled home with a fresh-caught halibut. This
        fish pervades the entire film, in real and imaginary form. Meanwhile,
        Axel tags fish in New York as a naturalist's gofer. He's happy there,
        but a messenger arrives to bring him to Arizona for his uncle's wedding.
        It's a ruse to get Axel into the family business. In Arizona, Axel meets
        two odd women: vivacious, needy, and plagued by neuroses and familial
        discord. He gets romantically involved with one, while the other, rich
        but depressed, plays accordion tunes to a gaggle of pet
        turtles</image:caption
