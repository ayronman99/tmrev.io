        >A postal worker falls in love with the Chinese waitress at a Chinese
        restaurant. They start dating and quickly fall in and out of love, the
        waitress returning to China. The young man looks for comfort in his
        father but he's too preoccupied with winning the Eurovision song
        contest. After listening to loser friends talk about what Sylvester
        Stallone would do in his situation, the postal worker decides to buy a
        ticket to China and follow his love to her home.</image:caption
