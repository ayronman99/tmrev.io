        >Two young men travelling the dark roads of New Zealand, have their
        friendship pushed to the limit when their car breaks down, stranding
        them in the middle of nowhere. A desolate rural road is the last place
        one would expect to find chaos, but this is no ordinary night. Trapped
        in increasingly hostile surroundings with no means of escape, the
        friends are forced to put their lives in each other's hands. As a
        haunting memory is slowly re-counted, each must come face to face with a
        chilling truth.</image:caption
