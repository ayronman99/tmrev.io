        >Jacobo is a young sculptor that returns to native city, Santiago of
        Compostela, to see his mother, locked up a psychiatric hospital for to
        kill to her husband, when he believed she dead years ago. To their
        arrival, visions of Mateo, his dead father eighteen years ago, begin to
        persecute to him, since his father died by shot gun, peculiarly, when
        thirteen peals sounded in the cathedral, fact what obsesses to Jacobo.
        After watching several times, Mateo convinces his son to make the work
        for the cathedral that his father couldn't finish in life, but what
        begins as a simple work becomes a madness spiral when Jacobo discovers
        the true intentions of the ghost of his father: to kill to his son to
        usurp his body to finish the statue, and after to return to the
        life.</image:caption
