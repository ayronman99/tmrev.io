        >A concert film capturing Devo at the Fox Theatre in Oakland on their
        2014 "Hardcore Tour," in which they performed 21 songs written and
        recorded before they signed with a major record label, many of which had
        never been performed live. The set is intercut with stories and
        commentary from the band members, as well as Toni Basil and V.
        Vale.</image:caption
