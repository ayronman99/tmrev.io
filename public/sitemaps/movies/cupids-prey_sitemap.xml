        >Rebecca Swain is a beautiful, intellectual young woman. Life is good to
        her. Her new boyfriend Matt's family is rich and socially prominent. The
        idea of a romantic weekend with him at his parents' palatial estate
        sounds inviting. The visit to paradise brings her face to face with
        Matt's family for the first time. His father, Jeremy, is dashingly
        handsome like his son. His mother Iris, on the other hand, looks at
        first glance to be a slightly unbalanced alcoholic. Rebecca instantly
        impresses Jeremy who is smitten with her charm and grace. As the weekend
        progresses, she finds herself seduced into a deadly love triangle. All
        is not as it seems between father, mother, and son. As Rebecca peels
        away the family's hidden realities, she finds herself embroiled in their
        secrets, and the unwilling victim of the family's most deranged member.
        She will need all her resources to uncover the ultimate horrible truth
        and stay alive.</image:caption
