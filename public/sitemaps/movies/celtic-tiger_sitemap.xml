        >Michael Flatley is the internationally acclaimed master of dance. In
        2005 his unrivalled skill and artistry combined in an epic that fused
        the spirit and history of Ireland with dance and music. The result was a
        masterpiece, showcasing Irish dance as a dynamic, powerful art form.
        Says Michael, "Celtic Tiger portrays the oppression of a people. The
        tiger itself symbolizes the awakening of their spirit in the struggle
        for freedom. The show itself is a 90 minute spectacular. It is very fast
        moving, powerful and hard-hitting and I think that it is something that
        you have never seen before."</image:caption
