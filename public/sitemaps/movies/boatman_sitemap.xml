        >An erstwhile boatman wants to do a little more than paddle his own
        canoe in the town famed for its waterfalls. He leaves the village of his
        roots for the city and lands a job as a live-sex actor called toro in
        street lingo derived from the Spanish term for bull. Quick successes in
        his newfound profession delude him into regarding that the measure of a
        man is in his trousers. He has a partner on stage and off. Despite her
        cynicism and tough veneer, she sees in him a way out of the slums and
        the red light district.</image:caption
