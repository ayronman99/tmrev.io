        >This is the story of a miracle that never happened... This is the story
        of a family... This is the story of my disabled brother... In fact, I
        think it's the story of a storm... I was 11 when my brother was born. It
        was August 30, 1977. It was the first time I saw my father cry. It was
        necessary to pray and above all, to be very wise. That's when my dad
        stopped talking and my mom stopped laughing.</image:caption
