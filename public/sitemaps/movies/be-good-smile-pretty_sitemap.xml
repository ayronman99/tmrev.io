        >A powerfully moving, personal exploration of a grief for the father she
        never knew, this award-winning film chronicles Tracy Droz Tragos'
        heart-wrenching quest to understand and cope with a loss shared by the
        estimated 20,000 Americans whose fathers were killed in Vietnam. Weaving
        emotionally compelling interviews with home movies, stock footage, and
        family photos, Tragos travels from Selma, Alabama, to the U.S. Senate in
        search of her father’s Naval Academy roommates and war buddies, each of
        whom has been silently mourning his death and remembers her father’s
        life in his own way. Along her journey, Tragos uncovers a 30-year-old
        mystery, as she comes to know her father as a man, untangled from the
        memory of a war that wounded a nation. And while some discoveries are
        almost too difficult to bear, it is ultimately the truth that allows
        her, and her entire family, to understand and move
        forward.</image:caption
