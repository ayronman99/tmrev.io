        >First they were called 'Guest-workers', then, foreigners and now
        'Allah's Daughters Without Rights'. BERLINER is a documentary film that
        exposes assumptions about, and issues for, women of Turkish background
        living in Berlin: navigating wearing (or not wearing) the headscarf, a
        classist education system and sensationalist media stories about their
        lives. BERLINER explores the lives of first, second and third generation
        women and their real struggles, as Muslims, and as part of the largest
        minority group in Berlin: post-war, post-Wall and post
        9/11.</image:caption
