        >"Days and nights" of work and rest in my flat set up as my workshop.
        For those who still believe that a free artistic activity (here the
        cinematograph) is not a kind of "work" (although this word's common
        meaning is at the very least darkened by suspect political
        considerations). Although "work" is not a "value" but at most a
        remainder of Judeo-Christian culpability (Adam and Eve driven out of the
        Eden and condemned to live of their work), it seems likely that human
        hyperactivity is effectively at the origin of this famous "reheating" of
        the planet. Thus, I conclude, so that this "work value" is a pretext for
        the capitalists to reduce the working classes to slavery and hence carry
        out their destroying madness. For my part, a moderate (artistic)
        activity helps me to keep in touch with my fellow humans and to maintain
        a "social" bond, the rest is only vanity...</image:caption
