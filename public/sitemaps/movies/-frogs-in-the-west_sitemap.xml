        >Marie Deschamps has her whole life ahead of her but isn't sure what to
        do with it. To the disappointment of her parents, she drops out of
        college and decides to go work in Whistler in order to perfect her
        English. After a journey across Canada, her arrival in British-Columbia
        is less glorious than she dreamt. Fortunately, she meets Jean-Francois
        Laforest, a Quebecois skier who has been living on the West Coast for 10
        years. J-F will introduce her to his Anglo friends and to the lifestyle
        of the mountains. Somewhere out West, this adventure will change her
        life forever.</image:caption
