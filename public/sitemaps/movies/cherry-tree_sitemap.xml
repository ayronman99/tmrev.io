        >Faith’s world is turned upside down after she finds out that her
        beloved father is dying. When the mysteriously alluring Sissy Young
        becomes her field hockey coach, Faith finds a compassionate spirit and
        much-needed mother figure. Little does she know that Sissy is the head
        of a centuries-old witches’ coven that uses the fruit of an ancient
        cherry tree in a secret ritual that restores life to the dead and dying.
        Offering to cure her father in exchange for a child, Sissy strikes a
        bargain with Faith, who suddenly finds herself pregnant with a baby
        that’s growing at an alarming rate. But with the clock to the child’s
        birth ticking down and the true intention of Sissy’s plans for humanity
        becoming more apparent, Faith and her father must stand together in
        order to save both their lives.</image:caption
