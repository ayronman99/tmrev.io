        >Pandelis is a garbageman who is anxiously waiting to retire and receive
        his well-earned superannuation payout. His wife and mother-in-law are
        also awaiting the super payout, but they have different ideas as to how
        the money should be spent. The usually submissive and calm Pandelis
        suddenly decides to react... Philippides does a sterling job as the
        long-suffering Pandelis and his vicissitudes leave one with a warm
        feeling. Unlikely though the scenario may seem, one wishes it to be
        true, thus giving hope for the many Pandelides out there who find
        themselves contemplating life in their middle years with regret and
        disappointment.</image:caption
