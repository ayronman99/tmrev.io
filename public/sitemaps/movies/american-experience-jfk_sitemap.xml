        >Forever enshrined in myth by an assassin's bullet, Kennedy's presidency
        long defied objective appraisal. Recent assessments have revealed an
        administration long on promise and vigor, and somewhat lacking in
        tangible accomplishment. His proposals for a tax cut and civil rights
        legislation, however, promised significant gains in the months before
        his assassination. While maturation, as evidenced in the handling of the
        Cuban missile crisis, was apparent, the potential legacy of the New
        Frontier will forever be left to speculation.</image:caption
