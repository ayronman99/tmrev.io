        >Moscow police detective Andrei Somov resigns and immigrates to the US,
        but has to accept a menial job in a restaurant while his adolescent son
        and pregnant daughter-in-law are denied exit visas. 'Andy' does however
        get to know some LAPD cops after volunteering his expertise and Russian
        language skills and is sent to Tijuana to fetch cheap tiles. On that
        Mexican journey, Somov bumps into Larry, another ethnic Russian but US
        citizen who lost his daughter years ago and now helps families to
        illegally enter the States. Meanwhile, the medium Michael March receives
        a vision about a mad bomber who targets pharmaceutical companies and
        gets a bad feeling upon holding an envelope that belongs to
        Larry.</image:caption
