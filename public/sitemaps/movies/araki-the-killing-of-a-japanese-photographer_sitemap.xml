        >Araki: The Killing of a Japanese Photographer is a story about a
        psychotic man who tries to defend the honor of his deceased sister. He
        sees himself as the Avenger, who fights the rotten core of society. The
        rotten core is the sex industry, which also caused the death of his
        sister. The Avenger has singled out an extremist, the Japanese artist
        Araki as the main culprit. On his crusade against Araki, the Avenger
        kills innocent people, among others, his sister's daughter. When he
        finally faces supreme evil in the shape of Araki, his flaming hatred is
        gone, and he realizes that Araki just took pictures of naked
        girls.</image:caption
