        >Angel’s Perch is the story of Jack, a successful architect living in
        Pittsburgh, who must make the trip to his tiny hometown when his
        grandmother Polly, who is suffering from Alzheimer’s, is found wandering
        outside her house one morning. But what was intended to be a two day,
        under the radar trip to town becomes more complicated when Jack is
        unable to move Polly into an assisted living facility. Torn between the
        career opportunity of a lifetime, caring for his last living relative
        and running from his own painful memories, Jack’s carefully constructed
        life begins to unravel.</image:caption
