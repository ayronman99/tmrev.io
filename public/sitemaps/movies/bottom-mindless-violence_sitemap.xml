        >The only word to describe the amazing duo of Rik Mayall and Adrian
        Edminson is genius. For the past 25 years they have provided us with
        some unforgettable programs that left us on the floor such as The Young
        Ones, The Dangerous Brothers and of course, Bottom. The DVD contains the
        very best and violent bits from the live shows and TV programmes that
        have starred the two slapstick legends in the past 25 years. With the
        help of the great comedy writers such as Ben Elton, they have produced
        many great moments, such as the sprouts of doom and the towering inferno
        impression that went horrifically wrong. Here they are, all of the great
        moments on 1 disc. Here is what you can expect from the greatest
        compilation of slapstick moments of all time!!!</image:caption
