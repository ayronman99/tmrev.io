        >Neo-Venezia has reached a long winter. Ai, Azusa and Anya, who were
        practicing jointly in the cold weather, visit the Undine Museum, led by
        Akira who seems not her usual self. At the museum, the trio meet its
        director, Asuka who is Akira's senior known as Himeya's legendary
        undine. The two of them are the successors to a gondola that has been
        carefully passed down since the founding of Himeya Company. However,
        Akira reveals that Aika, who is expected to inherit the gondola, has no
        intention of doing so. Azusa, who is not convinced, tries to find out
        why.</image:caption
