        >At school, Roseanne is the object of fellow student Vincent's
        infatuation. By night, she deals with a troubled family life: her
        mother, Maggie, cheats on her drunken husband, Fred. When Maggie's
        adultery is revealed, Fred viciously takes his anger out on stepdaughter
        Roseanne. With the help of her boyfriend, Jimmy, Maggie plots her
        revenge, but Vincent might be the one to help her forge a new life in
        this contemporary fable loosely based on Fyodor Dostoyevsky's "Crime and
        Punishment".</image:caption
