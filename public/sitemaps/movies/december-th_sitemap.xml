        >On December 12th, 1969 a bomb went off at the Piazza Fontana in Milan
        that killed 16 people and injured 84. Railway worker and anarchist
        activist Giuseppe Pinelli was picked up, along with other anarchists,
        for questioning regarding the attack. He was held and interrogated for
        three days, longer than Italian law specified that people could be held
        without seeing a judge. Just before midnight on December 15, 1969
        Pinelli was seen to fall to his death from a fourth floor window of the
        Milan police station. Although officially deemed a suicide, the reporter
        who watched the fall from the street maintained that he was pushed.
        Three police officers interrogating Pinelli were put under investigation
        in 1971 for murder but charges were dropped because of lack of
        evidence.</image:caption
