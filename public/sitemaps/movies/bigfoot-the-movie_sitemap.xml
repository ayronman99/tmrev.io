        >Bigfoot has come to the town of Ellwood City, PA and is causing BIG
        problems. Now it’s up to three town locals to take him down. Funded by a
        Kickstarter campaign and filmed in Ellwood City, LA Filmmaker and
        hometown hero Jared Show assembled a colorful cast of characters from
        all over the region to bring his vision to life! The movie features some
        of Pittsburgh’s most famous and best loved celebrities like Curt Wootton
        (Pittsburgh Dad), Joanie Dodds (America’s Next Top Model), Jim Krenn
        (stand-up comic, formerly of the WDVE morning show), Mike Wysocki
        (WDVE), and even veteran news anchor Darieth Chisolm (formerly of WPXI)
        among others. In this comedy/horror flick mullets, guns and beer are in
        full supply as the movie skewers the Pittsburgh ‘Yinzer’ stereotype
        right alongside the Bigfoot myth</image:caption
