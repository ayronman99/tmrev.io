        >All Maj. Amarjeet Singh wants is for his grandson Kunal to be as noble
        and brave as Amarjeet and the boy's father, Vikramjeet. But Kunal has
        other plans and does not wish to follow in his father's and
        grandfather's military legacies. Reluctantly, Kunal gives in and joins
        the army and ends up falling for Shweta, the widow of a fallen soldier.
        When the man later turns up alive, will Shweta return to him or stay
        with her new love?</image:caption
