        >DIARY OF A CO-WORKER is a 2005 feature film created in Saint Louis,
        Missouri, and largely shot on-location at the historic Hi-Pointe
        Theatre. An exploration of the adversity faced from all sides as a part
        of service-industry jobs, it follows the exploits of Morrison (Mort
        Burke, THE MINDY PROJECT, DRUNK HISTORY) as he navigates co-workers,
        bosses, and the general public among the daily tasks of movie theatre
        maintenance and his own sense of self-identity. DIARY OF A CO-WORKER was
        written and directed by Matt McLaughlin, features music by Kevin
        Buckley, and has a running time of 91 minutes. Viewer discretion is
        advised (for strong language and depictions of drug use)</image:caption
