        >Former national Aussie Football player Ledge had to quit the sport due
        to injury and started a fine career as police detective. He gets injured
        in a case. However IA, which always considered him the commissioner's
        pet, investigates against him. His old mate and competent lawyer Andy
        Grace gets him off, after which he retires honorably. However the
        criminals decide to set them up, using crafty underage homeless
        pickpocket The Kid. The gang has hidden ramifications.</image:caption
