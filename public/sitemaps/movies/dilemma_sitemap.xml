        >Gafur - an extreme Muslim who was brought up to view all aspects of
        earthly life as an investment in the afterlife. He runs into a
        streetwalker who looks exactly like his wife (if she were to wear
        make-up and seductive clothing). He takes a second glance, and, in
        horror, realizes that the woman could truly be his wife's identical
        twin. After a period of spiritual struggle, Gafur considers this a sign
        from God and decides to take on the mission of "saving" this woman from
        her perverted and sinful life. Stepping out of his secluded life, he
        spends time with the identical twin and experiences the outside world
        for the first time. This experience slowly drives Gafur into delusion
        and paranoia.</image:caption
