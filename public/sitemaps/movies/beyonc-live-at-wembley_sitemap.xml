        >Beyonce's London fans go crazy when the Destiny's Child beauty, on her
        first solo international tour, descends to a massive stage while
        suspended, upside down, from a wire. After a delicate landing, the star
        embarks on a set of recent hits immersed in complicated arrangements,
        including the Arabic sound of "Baby Boy" and "Naughty Girl," the chunky,
        hypnotic funk of "Hip Hop Star," and Beyonce: Live at Wembley's best
        performance, the powerful "Work It Out," in which the diva is at her
        clearest, jazziest, and most soulful. Not everything works. The bottom
        falls out of "Gift from Virgo," "Be with You" is forgettable, and
        Beyonce's stage patter needs polish. But a Destiny's Child medley
        accompanied by only a DJ is innovative and fun, "Summertime" proves a
        breezy dance number, and "Crazy in Love" is bolstered by what sounds
        like the old Stax horns.</image:caption
