        >H.R. Giger created one of the great iconic symbols of the cinema for
        the film 'Alien', here he talks about his work and the future of his
        projects including his Museum and Giger Bar at Gruyeres, Switzerland.
        Giger has since changed his mind on how he wants to be remembered at the
        end of the original film and this version has been recut only with that
        in mind.</image:caption
