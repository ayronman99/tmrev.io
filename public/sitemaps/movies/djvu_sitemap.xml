        >A cinematic experience by Douglas Gordon - in which the film D.O.A. is
        screened simultaneously on three screens beside one another, but at
        slightly different speeds. The films quickly fall out of synch with one
        another. Déjà-vu uses footage from D.O.A. 1949-50, a Hollywood thriller
        directed by Rudolph Mateé. The film has been transferred to video and is
        projected simultaneously on three parallel screens at normal speed as
        well as slightly faster and slightly slower - 25, 24 and 23 frames per
        second (left to right). This has the effect of making the three
        identical narratives diverge increasingly over time, and inducing in the
        viewer an experience similar to déjà-vu.</image:caption
