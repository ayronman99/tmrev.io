        >Adventurous flight attendant Sydney’s plans for a tropical Christmas
        get delayed when she helps an unaccompanied minor get home to Chicago to
        her dad Jonathan, a handsome widower and investigative reporter. Faced
        with a shortage of out-going flights, Sydney is marooned for several
        days in the Windy City – once her home as a small girl — and tags along
        with Jonathan, his daughter, and their exuberantly festive family until
        she can find a connecting flight. Jonathan makes her a deal: he helps
        her chase down the story of how her late parents met, and she helps him
        to write the perfect Christmas story and keep his job, and along the
        way, sparks form between them.</image:caption
