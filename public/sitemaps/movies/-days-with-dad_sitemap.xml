        >The last thing Eddie Mills wants to do is go home to deal with his
        dying Dad. But the Catholic guilt gnaws at him, and he returns home to
        his crazy family, an overbearing step-mother, and his bear of a father.
        Once there, Eddie is confronted with a revelation that forces him to
        deal with the past he has always avoided.</image:caption
