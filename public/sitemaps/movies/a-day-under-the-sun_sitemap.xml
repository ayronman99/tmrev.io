        >This poetic documentary film presents the one day events in the Zadar
        County. It starts late at night, during sleep. The sounds describe the
        nocturnal images - agitated animal-like bodies, empty streets and the
        allegorical scenes of a concealed reality. The film leads into the
        universal presence of nature and the human sphere of the senses. The
        film's rhythm changes in time and shows the transition from night to
        late afternoon in a Mediterranean ambiance. Playing with sudden fades
        from night to dawn, from tension to the carefree game of a spider, to
        flowers, bees and sheep in the rocky ground of the Island of Pag, and
        respecting silence as the natural flow of the events, this film makes
        one aware of the richness of change in the sublime ordinariness of a
        single day.</image:caption
