        >Steve Thompson, age 31, introduces himself to us: he's clay. He talks
        about the struggle of growing up clay, feeling different, getting picked
        on at school, thinking it was his fault, and drowning his sorrows at a
        clay bar. His dad, Lance, talks sympathetically about his son. Off
        camera, "Mr. X" looks back at the 1970s, when being clay was cool, but
        that time has passed. Steve discovers a support group, which helps him
        to accept that it's okay to be clay.</image:caption
