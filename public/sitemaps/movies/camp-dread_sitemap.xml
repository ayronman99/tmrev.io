        >The “Summer Camp” horror trilogy was one of the most popular franchises
        of the 1980s. However, the decade ended and so did director Julian
        Barrett’s career. Now Barrett plans to resurrect his gory series via a
        modern reboot patterned after reality filmmaking. With his former
        leading lady and an eclectic group of 10 young “contestants,” Barrett
        returns to the same locale where his old splatter-fests were filmed.
        When one of the campers is found savagely murdered, they realize there’s
        more at stake than just fame and fortune. Each of them is in a fight for
        their lives as they realize summer is over – forever.</image:caption
