        >This film, which many may assume is a historical punk documentary,
        actually is an honest and needed treatment of race and identity. Punk
        and Hardcore music is simply the microcosm in which it is told. First
        time Director, James Spooner, in telling this story, has opened new
        dialogues on these crucial subject both intra and interracially. Many
        times funny, sometimes sobering, a wake up call to America. An
        examination of the duality of racial identity that DuBois called "double
        consciousness." What could have been "The Bad Brains Story" is a story
        about kids, alienated by two cultures and two communities. Many of these
        punk and hardcore kids have never questioned their role in the punk
        scene or the black community until their interviews, and it's obvious as
        they struggle on camera to reconcile a fragmented self.</image:caption
