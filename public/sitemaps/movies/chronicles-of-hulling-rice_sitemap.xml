        >In the sound of rice huller, the rice falls to the jar; and in the
        booming sound of thunder, the rain drops falldown on the ground. Witha
        shovel on shoulder, we're farming under the sky. -- This is a children's
        folk rhymes used to be very popular among the Hakka people lived in the
        westernpart of Fujian Province, China. While farming is not an easy
        work, rice hulling is an even more laborious work. Rice-huller is a tool
        used by the peasants in southern China to hull the rice for thousands of
        years in theirfarming history. This documentary films the making of
        probably the last rice-huller ever made by mankind.</image:caption
