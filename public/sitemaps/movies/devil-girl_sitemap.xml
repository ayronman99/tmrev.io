        >Fay is a small town girl on a cross country road trip, trying to escape
        her own reality after the death of her father. When her muscle car
        breaks down during a drag race she finds herself stranded along route 66
        in an isolated desert town. Short on cash, she makes a series of choices
        to make enough money to repair her car. After encountering a neurotic,
        drug abusing clown she finds herself sliding down a dark spiral. Soon
        thereafter, her road trip starts to devolve into a living nightmare.
        Trapped and desperate, she fights to regain her identity while
        navigating through a host of locals; a creepy motel clerk, an
        overzealous preacher, and a sexy temptress with horns and a
        tail.</image:caption
