        >The Governor, two Georgia State Senators, a “man-on-the-street” in
        Atlanta, and folklorist, John Burrison speak in one voice authenticating
        Brunswick stew as a most beloved folk heritage stew of Georgia. The
        filmmaker reaches back into The Woodward Studio Folklife Archives in
        making this in-depth story of the origins of Brunswick stew in Georgia,
        ending up with freshly-shot footage of the Stewbilee in Brunswick, GA,
        where we hear from a member of the Georgia Sea Island Singers about her
        ancestors from the days of slavery who cooked Brunswick stews. This is
        truly a “roots” story about the origins and celebrations around this
        folk heritage stew of Georgia.</image:caption
