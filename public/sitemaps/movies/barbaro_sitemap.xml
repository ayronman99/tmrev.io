        >One year ago Barbaro emerged at Churchill Downs as the best
        three-year-old thoroughbred with a genuine chance at greatness. Fourteen
        days later, on May 20, all that changed when he suffered a devastating
        leg injury at the Preakness. Barbaro captures his spectacular victory
        and promising future; the heartbreaking events two weeks later at
        Pimlico; and the challenging medical procedures used to try and save the
        horse's life. Despite the odds, the Jacksons remained amazingly
        dedicated and never relinquished hope, with the medical expertise of Dr.
        Dean Richardson enabling Barbaro to survive in the wake of his accident.
        On Jan. 29, 2007, however, Barbaro's valiant struggle came to an end
        when he was euthanized after the pain from his injuries and subsequent
        surgeries became too great to sustain.</image:caption
