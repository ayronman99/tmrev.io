        >The film is set in Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose's home in Falta, West
        Bengal, masquerading as Uttarpara. It deals with the story of a girl
        Anandi and her family (including uncle, brother, parents and sister),
        lover (brother's friend Babua) and few neighbours. Nature, tradition and
        love are Anandi's pillars of support in difficult times. Her brother
        will slowly drift away with bad or risky companies, will not return home
        one day, and will be lost forever. Her parents will die heartbroken and
        her sister will get married suddenly and will leave the family. Babua
        will go abroad and marry somebody else.</image:caption
