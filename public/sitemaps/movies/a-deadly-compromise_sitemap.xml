        >In Genoa, Anna Merisi, the wife of the unconventional professor of the
        local university Paolo Merisi, decides to hire a babysitter for their
        son because she wants to work again to help to pay for their bills.
        Meanwhile, the deranged Caterina, who has just left a clinic, gets the
        Merisi family address and lies telling that she was sent by the agency.
        When Paolo sees her, he recalls that Caterina was his former student and
        they had an affair two years ago, but his wife is very connected to
        Caterina and he has no chance to fire her. When Caterina jeopardizes his
        marriage and his family, Paolo discloses his past to Anna. But Caterina
        does not want to give up on Paolo.</image:caption
