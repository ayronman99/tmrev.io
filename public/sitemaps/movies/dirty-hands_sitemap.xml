        >A political drama set in the fictional country of Illyria between 1943
        and 1945, the story is about the assassination of a leading politician.
        The country, an ally of Nazi Germany, is on the verge of being annexed
        to the Eastern Bloc. Kaurismäki's TV adaptation of Jean-Paul Sartre's
        play Les Mains Sales (Dirty Hands) tells the story of Hugo (Matti
        Pellonpää) who has just been released from prison. Before going to
        prison, he has worked as a journalist at his party's newspaper. This
        timid journalist, who uses the pseudonym Raskolnikov, wants to advance
        in his career and gets his chance when Hoederer (Sulevi Peltola), the
        leader of the party, has to be eliminated.</image:caption
