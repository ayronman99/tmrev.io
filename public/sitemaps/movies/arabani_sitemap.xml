        >After being estranged from his Druze village and family for 17 years,
        Yoseph returns with his two Israeli, teenage children. His marriage to a
        Jewish Israeli woman has just ended and he plans to settle down there.
        His arrival causes friction inside the closed, conservative Druze
        community and also with his mother Afifa, who accepts him and his
        children as part of her family again.</image:caption
