        >Samantha Hart is delighted when her online "Chance at Romance" to
        photographer Heath Madsen eventually results in Heath sending her a
        first class ticket to visit. Upon arriving for what she expects to be a
        romantic weekend, however, she learns her online relationship with the
        widowed photographer was actually manufactured a matchmaking twelve
        year-old. Sam is anxious to end her trip as quickly as possible, but a
        nasty bout of weather extends her stay through the end of the
        week.</image:caption
