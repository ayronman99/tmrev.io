        >After a construction project begins digging in their neighbourhood,
        best friends Tuck, Munch and Alex inexplicably begin to receive strange,
        encoded messages on their cell phones. Convinced something bigger is
        going on, they go to their parents and the authorities. The three embark
        on a secret adventure to crack the code and follow it to its source, and
        discover a mysterious being from another world who desperately needs
        their help. The journey that follows will change all their lives
        forever.</image:caption
