        >Berlin’s notorious Neukoelln district. The near future. A time in which
        the health system has collapsed. A man works in the shadows and without
        license as a doctor. He has no practice, no appointments system. He
        treats people in the courtyards and streets – everywhere he’s needed,
        stealing medicine from pharmacies. Nobody knows his name or that by day
        he’s the caretaker of a shabby tenement building. He pushes boundaries
        and suffers defeats that cost him the last of his strength. Forced to
        adopt the role of a shadow, an outlaw, he is confronted with the
        question as to whether he really is a doctor.</image:caption
