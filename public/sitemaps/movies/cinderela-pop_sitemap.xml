        >Cintia is modern princess, she's connected, decided and loves music.
        This "pop" princess used to live with their parents in a huge castle
        with a nice view to the city. Every night she looked through the window
        and watch the view dreaming with a prince she didn't met yet. But one
        day her castle crumbles with everything around her, after her parents
        divorce she went to live with her aunt and stops believing in love. What
        she didn't knew was that there was a charming prince in her history,
        that wanted to break the ice around our modern day
        cinderella.</image:caption
