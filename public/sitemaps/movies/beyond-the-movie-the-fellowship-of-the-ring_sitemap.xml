        >A documentary about the influences on Tolkien, covering in brief his
        childhood and how he detested the onslaught of industry through the
        idyllic countryside, moving on to describe his fighting experience from
        WWI, and closing with a look at the Finnish inspiration for the
        scholar's self-invented languages of Elfish. In between are interviews
        with the cast of the films and some clips, by far the most from "The
        Fellowship of the Ring", but a few glimpses of Rohan riders (from "The
        Two Towers") are provided. Also, there are interviews with a range of
        the filmmakers.</image:caption
