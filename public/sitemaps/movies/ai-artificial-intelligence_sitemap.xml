        >David, a robotic boy—the first of his kind programmed to love—is
        adopted as a test case by a Cybertronics employee and his wife. Though
        he gradually becomes their child, a series of unexpected circumstances
        make this life impossible for David. Without final acceptance by humans
        or machines, David embarks on a journey to discover where he truly
        belongs, uncovering a world in which the line between robot and machine
        is both vast and profoundly thin.</image:caption
