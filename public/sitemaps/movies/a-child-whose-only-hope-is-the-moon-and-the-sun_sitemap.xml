        >A village is assaulted by rebels. Everybody flees except for little
        Fabrice. He is first taken care of by the government army but
        subsequently dressed in uniform. With other children he is fighting in
        combat against the rebels. As a result of peace talks he is demobilized.

        following a training as a carpenter so as to have some potential to
        merge into civil society.</image:caption
