        >Arumugham is an uneducated, good hearted, helpful village hick. Easwari
        is his childhood friend. A chemical factory in the village pollutes the
        local river and when all attempts to stop the factory waste from going
        to the drinking water falls flat, the villagers decide to send Arumugham
        to Chennai and meet the concerned minister who has won from their
        constituency. He sets out for the city with Easwari and her grandmother
        and they stay with Arumugham's friend and gang.</image:caption
