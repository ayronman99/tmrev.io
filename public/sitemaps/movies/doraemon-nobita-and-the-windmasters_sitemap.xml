        >One day, Nobita runs into a creature-like ball of wind, which came from
        a faraway land, but blew into their neighbourhood following the recent
        typhoon that went through the area. Nobita names it Fuuko. Eventually,
        he, Doraemon and their friends take it to a vast countryside through the
        Anywhere Door. There, they learn about the Wind and Storm Villages, and
        Fuuko’s real identity. Soon, Nobita and his friends have to protect
        Fuuko from the Storm Village and a now-possessed Nobuo, who is being
        controlled by the spirit of the Storm Village’s former
        leader.</image:caption
