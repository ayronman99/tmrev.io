        >This is an intimate portrait of a single mother in Burkina Faso who
        supports her six children through her street-side rice business. Like so
        many African women, Awa has received no formal education and operates
        within the informal sector earning, on average, about ' a day. As Awa
        narrates her life story, she never pauses in her unending preparation of
        the rice. Her father forced her to marry his childhood friend and she
        bore four children before her husband died. Her husband's three other
        wives resented this new favorite and would not help her once she was
        widowed. Sustained by her faith in God, she began a street vending
        business to survive. Marrying again, this time for love, she was soon
        abandoned but left with two more children to feed. The film takes us
        through Awa's arduous 16 hour workday, interspliced with interviews of
        her children who are grateful for her hard work in their behalf. Here is
        a glimpse of some of the economic realities faced by women today in
        urban Africa.</image:caption
