        >Cinématon is a 156-hour long experimental film by French director
        Gérard Courant. It was the longest film ever released until 2011.
        Composed over 36 years from 1978 until 2006, it consists of a series of
        over 2,821 silent vignettes (cinématons), each 3 minutes and 25 seconds
        long, of various celebrities, artists, journalists and friends of the
        director, each doing whatever they want for the allotted time. Subjects
        of the film include directors Barbet Schroeder, Nagisa Oshima, Volker
        Schlöndorff, Ken Loach, Benjamin Cuq, Youssef Chahine, Wim Wenders,
        Joseph Losey, Jean-Luc Godard, Samuel Fuller and Terry Gilliam, chess
        grandmaster Joël Lautier, and actors Roberto Benigni, Stéphane Audran,
        Julie Delpy and Lesley Chatterley. Gilliam is featured eating a
        100-franc note, while Fuller smokes a cigar. Courant's favourite subject
        was a 7-month-old baby. The film was screened in its then-entirety in
        Avignon in November 2009 and was screened in Redondo Beach, CA on April
        9, 2010.</image:caption
