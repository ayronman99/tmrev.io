        >Nuclear war has ravaged the world. The remnants of humanity fight to
        survive, taking refuge in bleak settlements. The undead wander the
        earth, slaves to their blood-lust, or perhaps some higher power? The
        tattered town of Celestial sets the stage for the greatest battle of the
        New Dark Age! A score that must be settled and a reckoning that has been
        235 years in the making. Shadrach a man who watched his life burnt to
        the ground! Left for dead, having sold his soul to the devil with his
        last dying breath. A slave to the devil. Born again as a "Soul
        Collector".</image:caption
