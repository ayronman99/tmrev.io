        >Jean and Sara have been living together for 10 years. When they first
        met, Sara was living with François, Jean’s best friend and an admirer
        from back when he played pro rugby. Jean and Sara love each other. One
        day, Sara sees François in the street. He does not notice her, but she
        is overtaken by the sensation that her life could suddenly change.
        François gets back in touch with Jean. For the first time in years. He
        suggests they start working together again. From here on, things spiral
        out of control.</image:caption
