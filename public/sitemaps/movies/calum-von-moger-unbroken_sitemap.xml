        >To many in the bodybuilding world, Calum von Moger is seen as the
        future of the sport. A two time Mr. Universe champion who has proven
        himself to have one of the greatest physiques currently on the
        professional stage; Calum was catapulted into social media stardom.
        Known for his resemblance to Arnold Schwarzenegger and dubbed Arnold
        2.0. But a sudden and tragic bicep tear brought his training and goals
        to a grinding halt. Losing dozens of pounds of muscle and unable to
        train until fully recovering â€“ Calum was forced to reassess his
        bodybuilding path and find a way to fight back up to the top. Calum von
        Moger: Unbroken chronicles his rise, fall, and now recovery as he moves
        into a promising career in television and film. Showcasing a man with an
        indomitable will that overcomes all the hurdles in his path and taking
        him to a place that both skeptics and doctors thought was
        impossible.</image:caption
