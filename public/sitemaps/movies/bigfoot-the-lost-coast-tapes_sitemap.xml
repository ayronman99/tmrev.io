        >Sean Reynolds, a highly acclaimed investigative journalist (who
        strongly believed in paranormal phenomena), destroyed his career when
        the most watched episode of his reality show, based on paranormal
        phenomena, turned out to be a hoax. Sean saw a news report on a "Bigfoot
        Hunter" (Carl Drybeck) who claimed to possess the body of a dead
        Sasquatch. He believes Drybeck is a phony and decides to create a new
        show that reveals people's paranormal claims as hoaxes. Sean assembles
        his old film crew and heads to Northern California's "Lost Coast" to
        meet with and interview Drybeck. Obsessed, Sean is staking his comeback,
        his life and the lives of his documentary film crew on proving Drybeck's
        claim to be a hoax.</image:caption
