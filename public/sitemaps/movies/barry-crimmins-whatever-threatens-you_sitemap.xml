        >Following from Bobcat Goldthwait's revelatory documentary, Call Me
        Lucky, Barry Crimmins' friend Louis CK produced and directed Whatever
        Threatens You, his first comedy special, at the Lawrence Arts Center in
        Lawrence, Kansas in June 4th, 2016. It was then subsequently made
        available for download on Louis CK's website on October 23rd, 2016. The
        hour-long special is a sharp set of the biting social and political
        commentary that has defined Crimmins' career, touching upon his
        beginnings in helping to found the Boston comedy scene, right up to his
        thoughts on the upcoming 2016 US election.</image:caption
