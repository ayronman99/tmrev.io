        >Gioia has just turned 18. She lives with her father Bruno in a small
        country village where she works as a shepherdess. They live very simply
        yet harmoniously with the villagers. Their lives are disrupted when
        Bruno gives in once again and once too many to his gambling addiction,
        in spite of his efforts to quit. Gioia will have to follow him to a
        faraway town, where he will be treated in a specialized center. This
        will radically change her existence, forcing her to abandon the safety
        of the village, her friends and her habits. She will be all by herself
        to support her father, in his journey for a better life.</image:caption
