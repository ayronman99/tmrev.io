        >Three childhood friends. Three sworn brothers. One was initiated into
        the sacrament and grew up to be a great shaman. The other two followed
        the path of war and the nation recognised them as leaders. But only one
        of them was to become the ruler of the entire steppe. He was chosen by
        the Eternal Blue Sky and the Sky itself put him on a trial. Love for a
        woman will make him a warrior. Allegiance to the law will lead him to
        fratricide. Striving for peace will force him to start war. The council
        of nine tribes, speaking nine tongues, proclaimed him the sovereign and
        gave him the name of an ancient deity - Genghis Kahn.</image:caption
