        >João Goulart (known as Jango) had been democratically elected president
        of Brazil, but was expelled from office after the coup of April 1, 1964.
        After that, Jango lived in exile in Argentina, where he died in 1976.
        The circumstances of his death in the neighboring country were not well
        explained today. His body was buried immediately after his death,
        raising the suspicions of premeditated murder. This documentary brings
        the issue back to the fore and tries to publicly clarify some obscure
        facts of the history of Brazil.</image:caption
