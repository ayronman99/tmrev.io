        >The fact that Rudolph Moshammer is a dazzling figure and the most
        prominent fashion designer in Munich is no longer enough for his silent
        partners and financiers. So it happens that he is looking for a
        seductive woman to sell and - to the horror of his mother - brings on
        the young pedicurist Evi from Augsburg, of all places. With Evi's help,
        Mosahmmer wins the hearts and purses of the truly rich - if it weren't
        for his mother, who is scheming in the background. A fictional story
        that tells of beauty and money, but also of the friendship of two
        outsiders in Munich in 1983.</image:caption
