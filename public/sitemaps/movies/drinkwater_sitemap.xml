        >In small-town British Columbia, Canada, awkward teen Mike Drinkwater
        has trouble fitting in and is bullied by his antagonist and rival:
        wealthy school jock, Luke Ryan. While Mike's offbeat father, Hank,
        spends more time defrauding the government than being a role model; Hank
        is dealing with his own longstanding condemnation by Luke's father
        Wesley Ryan, which seems to fuel Luke's hostility towards Mike. Enter
        Wallace, a young girl from the United States who is adjusting to life in
        a new place while recovering from her own personal tragedy. Wallace's
        strength of character helps transform her life and the lives of the
        people around her.</image:caption
