        >Buddy Gilbert (Gavin Bellour) is a struggling musician living in NYC.
        He spends his days touring the northeast with his pet turtle, playing
        community centers, dive bars and coffee shops because, he says, it beats
        a 9-to-5. One day, Buddy overhears his neighbor Susan (Elisabeth Moss)
        get in a particularly bad argument with her boyfriend and, although he
        barely knows her, he finds himself taking her out for some cheer-me-up
        ice cream.</image:caption
