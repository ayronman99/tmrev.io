        >Summer of 1982, a beach in the south of Portugal. Rui and his parents
        live closed in their worlds, blind to the failure that characterizes
        them as a family and condemns them to the malaise of survival. Rui will
        have school exams but he is only interested in music and in the
        exploration of imaginary worlds that he constantly sketches in drawings.
        Only Joana seems capable of pulling him out of his autism. The girl's
        vitality fascinates him.</image:caption
