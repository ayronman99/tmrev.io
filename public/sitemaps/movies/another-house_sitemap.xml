        >Mathieu Roy's Lâ€™Autre maison is an intimate and powerful family drama
        featuring three generations of great Quebec Actors. Marcel Sabourin
        plays Henri Bernard, an 86 year-old man with a failing grip on reality.
        His sons, a jet setting middle aged photo-journalist (Roy Dupuis) and a
        younger pilot-in-training (Emile Proulx-Cloutier) disagree on a course
        of action, leaving the father and the younger son inhabiting a rustic
        cottage in the woods. As the older man's health deteriorates, options
        become more limited; when an IED accident in Afghanistan kills the
        photo-journalist's translator, the family must come together like never
        before. Shot in Quebec, Iceland, Africa and Asia, Another House blends
        elements of memory, perception and lyricism into a remarkable cinematic
        mix that moves the story well beyond direct domestic issues into a
        visual realm that balances nature and humanity.</image:caption
