        >A wealthy film producer Michael Pace discovers a beautiful unconscious
        woman pushed ashore by what appears to be a friendly dolphin. Confused
        and captivated by the apparent supernatural events taking place around
        him, Michael decides to make a film about his experience with the
        mysterious woman from the sea. Very soon the movie that Michael is
        making entwines itself into his family's past, his children's lives, and
        the very future of their existence together. Set at the cross roads of
        the modern world and ancient mystical cults, "Bad Girl Island" spins a
        tale of murder, obsession and seduction that leads its audience into a
        labyrinth of intrigue, action and mysterious forces.</image:caption
