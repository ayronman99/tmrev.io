        >Female boxer Diana Prazak always want to fight the best in her league,
        therefore she accepts the invitation by the number one in the world
        Frida Wallberg to fight her for the WBC world title in Stockholm. Lucia
        Rijker, former 6x world champion, coaches Diana to prepare her
        physically and mentally for the toughest fight of her life and her
        biggest and most paralyzing fear: losing. In Stockholm they are
        confronted with the picture-perfect Frida and her glamorous and extended
        entourage. The brutal fight however, takes a dramatic turn. Diana is
        left to consider if she truly got what she wished for.</image:caption
