        >A police detective consults with incarcerated serial killer Ted Bundy
        to help him catch The Green River Killer. Based on terrifying true life
        elements which inspired Silence of the Lambs. In 1984, police in
        Washington State are investigating a spate of serial murders committed
        by a mysterious man known as The Green River Killer. With no leads to go
        on, the detective in charge of the case consults with psychologists in
        an attempt to get inside the mind of the killer. But when that doesn't
        produce a positive result and the killings continue, the detective
        realizes that the only way to understand what makes a serial killer tick
        is to meet one. So he visits the imprisoned Ted Bundy, one of the most
        notorious serial killers in American history.</image:caption
