        >Mariagrazia, Chiara and Letizia are inseparable friends forced to come
        to terms every day with the hated extra kilos, looks of disapproval from
        their schoolmates and giggles in the school hallways. Mariagrazia
        suffers for the confrontation with her mother (Valeria Solarino), a
        former sports champion. Chiara has a chat with a peer, but she is too
        afraid to send him her photo. Letizia has a talent for music but too
        much shame to show it. After the umpteenth teasing, an unexpected
        opportunity for redemption comes from the popular and beautiful Alice,
        captain of the synchronized swimming school team, forced by a blackmail
        to train them in secret. The three girls embark on an impossible
        challenge, driven into the water by their desire for
        revenge.</image:caption
