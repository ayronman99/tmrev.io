        >Highly interesting documentary Concorde's Last Flight tells the story
        of this eventually ill fated super plane, which could fly from London to
        New York in three and a half hours and travelled at twice the speed of
        sound but it was it's final flight and the crash just outside Paris of
        Air France Flight AF4590 that ultimately sealed its fate. Ten years
        later the French Courts are still trying to discover just what happened
        and who, if anyone, was to blame.</image:caption
