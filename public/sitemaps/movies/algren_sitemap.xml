        >Algren will spotlight the hard-knock life and authentic creative legacy
        of one of the most underrated writers of the twentieth century, Nelson
        Algren. Algren's brutally honest portrayal of the American underclass
        and his hard-nosed lifestyle became his pathway to compassion. Through
        interviews with Algren contemporaries, experts, and "literary
        soulmates," as well as through the photography of Algren's friends, Art
        Shay and Stephen Deutch, the film will tell his story. It will celebrate
        his tremendous contribution to and influence on American letters, and
        push Algren, champion of the marginalized, out from the
        margins.</image:caption
