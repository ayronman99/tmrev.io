        >Alfie Singh, accountant turned film producer, has a great idea for a
        film. It's called Ealing Comedy and it's about an accountant turned film
        producer called Alfie Singh. Alfie will play himself and his real son,
        Paul, will play his son in the film. Turned down by all the financiers,
        Alfie vows to make the film himself. His life with his wife and teenage
        son and his struggles to finance and make films in the UK are all woven
        together in a series of mad-cap events, resulting in a very British
        film</image:caption
