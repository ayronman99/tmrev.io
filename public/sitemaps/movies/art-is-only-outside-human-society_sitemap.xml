        >Vlado Kristl rejected the word anarchy. Nor did he like the word
        utopia, nor the term experimental film. As a matter of fact, he didn't
        like any words if they weren't freed from the conventional ways of
        thinking. Following the shooting of "Kunst ist nur ausserhalb der
        Menschengesellschaft" he was only pleased when hardly anything he

        and alien environment by Carola Regnier was understood. - Markus
