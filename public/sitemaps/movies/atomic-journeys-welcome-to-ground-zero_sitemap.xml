        >Through the use of spectacular, never-before-seen nuclear test footage,
        travels to ten former testing sites and explores the history, physical
        changes resulting from the tests and current condition of these amazing
        and important places. Visit the notorious Nevada Test Site, known as the
        most bombed place on earth. Over 900 nuclear explosions where detonated
        at this location – an area larger than the State of Rhode Island. Once
        upon a time these locations were kept top secret, but today, with this
        60th Anniversary Diamond Edition of Atomic Journeys: Welcome to Ground
        Zero, you will finally see these historic hot spots. Preserving the
        incredible legacy of America’s nuclear testing program stands as a
        reminder of the fine line between the progress of mankind and the
        destruction of the earth. Once you understand what really happened at
        the Ground Zero nuclear testing sites, you will never be the
        same.</image:caption
