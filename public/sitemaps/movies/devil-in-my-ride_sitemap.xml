        >Doreen is about to marry the man of her dreams, Hank, a mild-mannered
        guy who is equally as excited about marrying Doreen. However, Doreen's
        older brother, a wild man named Travis who's been estranged from her for
        several years, shows up to make amends, but instead he accidentally
        curses her. Doreen is now possessed by the devil. In Las Vegas is a
        homeless man known as Johnny Priest, who is the last known person to
        perform an exorcism in America. It's up to Travis and Hank to put aside
        their differences and travel from Chicago to Las Vegas to get Doreen an
        exorcism before it's too late and her soul is lost
        forever.</image:caption
