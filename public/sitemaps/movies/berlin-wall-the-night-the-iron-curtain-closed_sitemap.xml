        >In August, 1961 three million Berliners woke up to discover their world
        had been thrown into chaos. In total secrecy a 28-mile ring of steel had
        been erected in the dead of night, forming a barrier between east and
        west Berlin and tearing the city in two. This new and exclusive film
        tells the incredible story of how that night of 13th August unfolded,
        and traces the events leading up to the partition of this historic
        European city. Using eyewitness reports and letters from the families
        and soldiers that lived through the nightmare, the film also uses East
        German sources and archive footage taken from the 12 hours leading up to
        the erection of the wall. The Night The Iron Curtain Closed provides a
        chilling account of how, overnight, a new country was born, an old
        country was cut in half and how the Berlin Wall heralded the birth of
        the Cold War.</image:caption
