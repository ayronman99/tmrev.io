        >Have you ever known who was calling before you answered the phone, or
        felt you were being watched while in an empty room? Is it possible to
        exist across multiple worlds simultaneously? When her young daughter
        insists sheâ€™s sometimes human and sometimes an animal, filmmaker Phie
        Ambo wonders what else might exist outside a singular human
        consciousness. Committing to the principal of randomness, she plumbs the
        minds of various leading thinkers, from the father of string theory to a
        Buddhist monk, from a clairvoyant to a janitor. Just as impressive as
        their fascinating ideas, however, is the visual correlative of this
        ever-deepening metaphysical query. Who would expect the mysteries of
        existence to lurk inside the grease trap at an amusement park or in a
        single cup of tap water? Prepare to have your reality permanently
        altered by this mind-boggling, impossible and thoroughly compelling
        film.</image:caption
