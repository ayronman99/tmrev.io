        >Headmaster Sturgeon has had enough. In an attempt to put an end to
        Bruno and Boots high jinks, he declares that they are to be separated;
        no shared classes and, most certainly, no shared dorm room. This
        punishment is worse than anything the boys could have imagined. However,
        if Bruno and Boots can alienate every boy in Dormitory 3, Sturgeon will
        be forced to re-unite them. The plot almost succeeds, but one misstep
        forces the girls from the Scrimmage Academy for Education and Awakening
        to move into Macdonald Hall, leaving Bruno and Boots back where they
        started.</image:caption
