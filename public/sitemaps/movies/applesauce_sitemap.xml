        >Every Tuesday night, radio talk show host Stevie Bricks invites his
        listeners to call in and share their stories. When one night he asks
        people to share the worst thing they’ve ever done, high school teacher
        Ron Welz can't resist. Big mistake—what he reveals sets off a chain of
        hilariously uncontrollable events adversely affecting his marriage and
        another couple. And when someone starts sending him body parts, his life
        really begins to fall apart. Who is tormenting him? An insolent high
        school student? His best friend? His wife? There are over eight million
        people in the Naked City, and everyone's a suspect.</image:caption
