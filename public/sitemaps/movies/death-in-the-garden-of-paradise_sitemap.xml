        >Death in the Garden of Paradise is an intensely personal meditation on
        the murder of the filmmaker's father and sister in Lahore by an unknown
        intruder. The disassociation caused by traumatic loss and the
        impossibility of knowing the identity of the killer flow seamlessly into
        the film's aesthetics so that familiar sights become strange,
        shopkeepers and passing pedestrians become suspects, and sound is
        fragmented and distorted. Architecture and haunted spaces, deserted
        gardens, photographs and paintings are both metaphors and physical
        locations in this elegant elegy to mortality</image:caption
