        >Chapter and Verse is an experimental documentary that traces the image
        legacy of Northern Ireland's recent troubles via its contemporary
        landscapes. The camera roves with fierce curiosity amongst the Orange
        Order Parades, the raging 11th Night Bonfires of Belfast, the wall
        paintings of Londonderry, empty border-lands, murder-sites, cemeteries,
        home interiors, town and city streets whilst exploring how the troubles
        are both revealed and concealed by the Northern Irish landscape.
        Interviews with a mix of Northern Irish politicians, religious figures
        and victims of the troubles, including Rev. Ian Paisley and Bishop
        Emeritus of 'Derry Edward Daly, combine in a cinematic study of the
        complex effects of Northern Ireland's conflict history suspended in
        language.</image:caption
