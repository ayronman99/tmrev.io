        >On the 23rd August 2004 The Great War Society undertook a charity march
        in full period uniform to commemorate the 90th anniversary of the
        opening moves of the Great War 1914-1918 Over the following five days
        our troops marched from Mons in Belgium to St. Quentin in France in
        remembrance of the soldiers of the British Expeditionary Force. The
        march was in honour of the men who fought the famous Fighting Retreat
        which stemmed the German advance and ultimately turned the tide of the
        war. Filmed in Super 8 black and white, Brass Monkey is the first
        documentary by William Hamper</image:caption
