        >In 1968, the fury and violence of the Democratic National Convention in
        Chicago propelled us toward a tipping point in politics. Martin Luther
        King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy were assassinated, America suffered its
        bloodiest year in Vietnam and drugs seduced us. Yet idealism--and
        hope--flourished. Explore the significance of that turbulent year and
        the way it continues to affect the American landscape. Tom Brokaw offers
        his perspective on the era and shares the rich personal odysseys of some
        of the people who lived through that chaotic time, along with the
        stories of younger people now experiencing its aftershocks. Includes
        archival footage and interviews with former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young,
        who was talking to King when he was assassinated and rushed to his side
        to try to staunch the wound; Olympic gold medalist Rafer Johnson, who
        wrestled RFKs' assassin to the ground; and Arlo Guthrie, best known for
        his song "Alice's Restaurant.</image:caption
