        >Centers around the lives of Victoria, Zenobia, Clevon, and Phil -- all
        friends approaching the age of 35 and struggling to build the families
        they've always dreamed of. While Zenobia (Nicole Ari Parker) is still
        looking for a man, Victoria (Tamala Jones) is married to a man who
        doesn't want children. Clevon (Kevin Hart), meanwhile, is too geeky to
        get a woman, and Phil (Keith Robinson) is already married with children,
        but his wife is not very interested in being a mother. All four of them
        try to rectify their romantic lives and futures while their biological
        clocks tick away.</image:caption
