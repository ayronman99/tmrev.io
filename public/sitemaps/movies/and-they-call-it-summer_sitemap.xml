        >Dino and Anna are a couple in their forties. Their relationship is
        hardly conventional: in fact, it is unconsummated. Dino gets out of it,
        gratifying himself with prostitutes and swingers. He reaches his nadir
        when he looks up Anna’s old boyfriends to ask about their sexual
        relations with her, and even begs them to take her back, as a way to end
        their relationship. Anna can’t find a way out herself; she can’t bring
        herself to end this one-of-a-kind, tormented love affair. In the end,
        Dino’s angst is what makes her feel loved, feel unique. No solution
        seems to be waiting in the wings.</image:caption
