        >Mesopotamia was the site of the Sumerian civilisation, which flourished
        at the confluence of the rivers Tigris and Euphrates. From 5000 to 2000
        BC, the Sumerians flourished in a hostile environment by developing
        agriculture and irrigation and they opened up the trade routes of the
        ancient world. It was the Sumerians who invented writing and the wheel,
        and they first divided time into minutes and seconds. In the end however
        the Babylonian civilisation took the place of the Sumerians. However
        their heritage and myths live on in the Mediterranean and Western worlds
        to this day.</image:caption
