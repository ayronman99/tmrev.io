        >A restless suburb in the Northeast-Helsinki. A drunk is raving
        violently in the hallway. A post box frame is stuck on his arm. There is
        blood on the stairs. Black Hole Mama does not romanticize poverty. Some
        residents have clearly lost control over their own lives and consume
        alcohol in unhealthy amounts. Still, as the rascals and yobs tell their
        life stories, it is difficult not to be surprised and touched. The black
        and white imagery emphasizes the nostalgic yet timeless mood of the
        film. It is easy like a summer afternoon, sunny with just a hint of
        sadness.</image:caption
