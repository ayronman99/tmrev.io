        >Gu Hua is a computer programmer who lived with accountant Zi Yu because
        of a lack of public funds. Later, in order to gain wealth and honor, he
        secretly communicated with the chairman 's daughter Huang Shibei. As a
        result , the stinky history of that year was exposed and made him face
        ruin. In order not to put himself in jail and to marry Shibei in the
        future, he killed Ziyu and destroyed the evidence. But I didn't expect
        that the retribution that followed would make Gu Hua feel
        unbearable.</image:caption
