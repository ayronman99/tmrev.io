        >Over several years, we follow three households and their emotions in a
        barrio of Havana. Magalis is a nurse, rarely happy. An older man,
        Ignacio, professes his love for her; her father and her brother quarrel
        over her brother's sexual orientation; she thinks about leaving Cuba.
        Santo's wife Maria is expecting their first child. Tragedy strikes and
        Santo leaves, drowning sorrows in alcohol and crime while his son grows
        up in the care of an aunt wondering where dad is. Vivian and Chino are
        in love, passionate, but childless. The pressures of a society that
        demands grandchildren strain their relationship.</image:caption
