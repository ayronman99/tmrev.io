        >"Little Uma, an 11-year-old schoolgirl, has an apparently simple
        desire: she wants to take dancing lessons. She is an Indian girl and
        lives in Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Malaysia. There is nothing
        exceptional about that, because since the British colonial era, ten
        percent of the Malaysian population is of Indian descent. ... this film
        is set today in the city and it is apparent that the Indian community
        still doesn’t play a full part in Malaysian society. Partly as a result
        of this, Uma’s ordinary desires are not easy to fulfil. She lives with
        her mother and her elder brother in the down-at-heel Brickfield. Her
        brother didn't finish school and is bitter about their living
        conditions. A career in crime beckons." - IFFR</image:caption
