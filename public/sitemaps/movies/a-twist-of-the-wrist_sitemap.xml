        >This DVD puts you on the bike with eight different, exciting camera
        positions. With nearly 400 action shots, not only on the bike but also
        from trackside and high above the rider, you see correct and incorrect
        riding. Drawings, diagrams and computer animations and demonstrations
        bring your visualization of riding into a crystal clear understanding of
        cornering and braking. No one has taken more time and care in developing
        the cornering arts than California Superbike School Director Keith Code.
        "Ride for fun or ride for fame, cornering is still the name of the
        game," he says.</image:caption
