        >Conan Edogawa is facing a dilemma: Ran Mouri has asked Shinichi Kudou
        out to the movies and he is unable to provide a convincing excuse not to
        go. However, when the day of the date arrives, he has more pressing
        problems to worry aboutâ€”a great amount of plastic explosives has
        recently been stolen and the culprit has challenged Shinichi to find and
        dispose of the bombs he has scattered across the city. Now forced in a
        race against time, Conan must not only protect the city, but also figure
        out who the mastermind is and his reason for confronting
        Shinichi.</image:caption
