        >Following the arrival of the New Year, Slimane's (Kamel Touati) wife,
        Zeineb (Jamila Chihi), offers to go and spend it in a hotel. Meanwhile,
        her mother Douja, desperate to have canceled her date, is putting
        together a plan with Fadhila (Mouna Noureddine) which consists of
        leaving with them that day. The couple then finds themselves for this
        evening with Sboui, his wife, his children and their mothers. Sboui
        begins to make mistakes (forgetting his brother's suitcase on the bus,
        buying drinks, destroying the swing and stolen belongings in the hotel),
        which makes the stay unpleasant for the couple.</image:caption
