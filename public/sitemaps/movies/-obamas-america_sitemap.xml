        >2016: Obama's America takes audiences on a gripping visual journey into
        the heart of the worlds most powerful office to reveal the struggle of
        whether one man's past will redefine America over the next four years.
        The film examines the question, "If Obama wins a second term, where will
        we be in 2016?" Across the globe and in America, people in 2008 hungered
        for a leader who would unite and lift us from economic turmoil and war.
        True to Americas ideals, they invested their hope in a new kind of
        president, Barack Obama. What they didn't know is that Obama is a man
        with a past, and in powerful ways that past defines him--who he is, how
        he thinks, and where he intends to take America and the world. Immersed
        in exotic locales across four continents, best selling author Dinesh
        DSouza races against time to find answers to Obama's past and reveal
        where America will be in 2016.</image:caption
