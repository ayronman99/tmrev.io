        >"Three tales of sex and violence presented by TORO LOCO, a blood
        thirsty, perverted killer cowboy seeking and killing people that starred
        in some exploitation movie. He is showing his victims the movies before
        torturing and killing them with a cow skull. The first story deals with
        two inspectors hunting a cannibal serial killer called "The Tiger". The
        second is about a 'not-so-devoted' husband interested in having a night
        of perverted sex with a prostitute in a motel room. The third is a
        tragical love story between a poor, little man oppressed by his wife and
        an handsome boy with self-destruction tendencies.</image:caption
