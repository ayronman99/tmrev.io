        >27-year-old Eto Kana lives in Tokyo and has never been out of the city
        before. She used to work as a designer and stay in a company dormitory
        but moved back to her family home after resigning due to the stress from
        interpersonal relationships. Meanwhile, Kanaâ€™s family gets a call about
        an elderly granduncle who got injured. She goes to Kyoto where he lives
        at the request of her worried mother and stays there for several days to
        take care of him.</image:caption
