        >In the year 2012, the 3rd great war comes to an end. The war claims no
        victors, but both sides succeed in executing their chemical warfare
        campaigns. The result is over 3 billion deaths. Over ninety-eight
        percent of the male survivors are rendered sterile. Human reproduction
