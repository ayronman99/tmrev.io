        >Ellie is a 27-year old whose life is far from where she imagined it to
        be. Filled with annoying friends, a self-involved boyfriend, and a
        career that she can’t bring herself to pursue, Ellie feels detached from
        her life. When she learns that her estranged alcoholic father has died,
        her world is disrupted and she begins a journey that takes her to a
        small town in Texas. While dealing with the logistical arrangements of
        her father’s death Ellie has to confront what happens when the
        structures and safety nets we build for ourselves come
        undone.</image:caption
