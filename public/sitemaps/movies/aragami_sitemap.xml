        >Two seriously wounded samurai find refuge from a storm at an isolated
        temple, the home of a swordsman and a mysterious young woman. One
        samurai awakes to find that not only has his comrade died, but that his
        wounds have miraculously healed. He discovers that he has been given the
        power of immortality by the swordsman, a man once known as the legendary
        Miyamoto Musashi, who now lives an endless existence as Aragami, a "god
        of battle".</image:caption
