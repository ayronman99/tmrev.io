        >In the dystopian future of 2052, mankind has devolved into two extremes
        of "have's" and "have not's". Those with the means have become so
        decadent that, if they wish, they have the power to hunt and kill
        another human being. Those without the means have become the hunted. The
        Brotherhood of Mars Corporation controls the battlefield where the hunts
        are staged. When the Brotherhood casts out one of their own, Morgan,
        into the dangerous wilderness, he must quickly adapt and join a
        struggling tribe of survivors. There he meets Naomi, a beautiful and
        resourceful young woman who's deadly with her bow. Just when they learn
        to trust each other, the Brotherhood of Mars have sent out their most
        bloodthirsty hunters to track them down. Let the games
        begin!</image:caption
