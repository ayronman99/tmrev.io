        >When Detective Mortimer Shade is somehow killed in a freezer, a
        parasite called a grail possesses his body, revives him, but he needs
        blood to stay alive. His partner John Dark accepts the new situation and
        together they become vigilantes, judging and killing the bad guys, with
        Shade sucking their blood with his claw. However, Dark notes that Shade
        is losing the rest of his humanity and becoming a monster, being aware
        and afraid of the danger Shade represents to mankind and trying to stop
        him.</image:caption
