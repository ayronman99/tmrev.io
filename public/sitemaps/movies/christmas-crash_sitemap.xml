        >A husband, wife and their two daughters take a Christmas break at a
        lodge in the woods. There's evident tension between the couple. He's
        pulled by attention to his corporation and negotiations about a merger.
        Even on their vacation he's on the phone. She's feeling abandoned. He
        takes her on a light plane flight to a cabin across the lake, but their
        plane suddenly loses altitude. They crash into the lake before they can
        notify anyone. The husband is more seriously hurt but with his wife's
        assistance they navigate cross-country towards a distant highway.. While
        they struggle to cross a ridge, the husband's business partner moves
        behind the scenes to sell the company to raiders, apparently assuming
        Frank is dead. Attacked by rogue wolves, the husband and wife are
        rescued in the nick of time. The FAA begins an investigation of the
        plane crash while the family begins to heal the emotional and physical
        wounds.</image:caption
