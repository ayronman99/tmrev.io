        >In three years of filmic research, the artist and author Stefan Römer
        has interviewed numerous outstanding international artists with his film
        team. In engaging in intellectual exchanges before the camera, Stefan
        Römer is able to develop a special filmic mode of reflecting on the
        state of international contemporary art. The film essay »Conceptual
        Paradise: There Is a Place for Sophistication« traces out the debates
        that allowed the intellectual art movement of Conceptual art to emerge
        in the 1960s and led to the most relevant questions in art today. The
        artists speak about their own artistic practices and the
        socio-historical development of the various conceptual movements. In so
        doing, it becomes clear that there can be no one valid definition of
        conceptual art, since a permanent engagement also makes up its
        theoretical and philosophical complexity, including for example the
        question of whether there can be art without an object.</image:caption
