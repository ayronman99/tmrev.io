        >New mother Molly (Eléonore Hendricks) is overcome with the need to run
        away. Feeling abandoned by her husband and unable to connect with her
        infant son, she takes up an invitation from her old high school group of
        guy friends to go on a weekend trip to the mountains. Without the
        pressure of daily responsibilities and with the help of psychoactive
        mushrooms, Molly comes out of her shell and is ready to accept the
        beauty and love that can be found in nature. When Molly's “trip” turns
        into a dark out-of-body experience she is forced to choose between the
        person she was and the person she's become.</image:caption
