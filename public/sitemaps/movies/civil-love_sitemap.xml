        >Rachel is a widow during the Civil War who holds the South responsible
        for her husband's death. When a wounded enemy soldier takes refuge in
        her barn, Rachel reluctantly helps him. As she gets to know him more,
        she realizes she must protect him from the dangerous men pursuing him,
        and discovers a courage she didn't know she had - the courage to love
        again.</image:caption
