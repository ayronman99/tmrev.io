        >Trapped in the center of a lucrative organ trafficking racket, Claire
        (Jessica Hegarty) discovers her father runs the grisly global criminal
        organization. Her sheltered life now shattered and exposed, Claire must
        work with Interpol to pursue the hidden truth. This journey thrusts
        Claire into a dark world, forced to fight for her life against a barrage
        of deadly hitmen assigned to silence her. No match against such
        organized assassins, Claire's only hope rests on a chance encounter with
        a protective guardian, Michael (Rody Claude), who is not all as he
        seems. Her fight for survival reunites Claire with her father, pushing a
        family's bond to its limits in a tense and desperate
        showdown.</image:caption
