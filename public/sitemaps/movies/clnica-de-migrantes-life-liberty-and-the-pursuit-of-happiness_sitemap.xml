        >Puentes de Salud is a volunteer-run clinic that provides free medical
        care to undocumented immigrants in south Philadelphia. Here, doctors and
        nurses work for free to serve people who would otherwise fall through
        the cracks. Clinica de Migrantes, a potent film by Maxim Pozdorovkin,
        follows the workers and patients of Puentes through months of routine
        care and growth. Along the way, the film puts a face to the millions of
        people who exist on the margins of society: people displaced from their
        homelands, separated from their families, unfamiliar with the customs,
        unable to obtain health insurance and terrified to come forward to seek
        medical help. Along with revealing these patient stories, Clinica is
        also a look at the heroic doctors and nurses who work pro bono to ensure
        these people receive care, offering a deeply moving look at the
        limitless potential of humanity.</image:caption
