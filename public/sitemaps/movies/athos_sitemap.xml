        >The Athos peninsula in Greece is one of Europe's last secrets. Over
        2000 monks live on Athos - cut off from the outside world. Access is
        denied to women, tourists are not welcome. Only workers and pilgrims can
        obtain a visa. The "Autonomous Monastic State of the Holy Mountain"
        attracts people who feel like they are missing something from their
        modern lives. With the help of three Athos monks, "Athos - A Taste of
        Heaven" tells the story of the island and its inhabitants in a unique
        filmed diary style. The film's guiding theme is the path we as people
        have to find and follow - each and everyone for themselves. "First we
        must heal our own souls, only then we can help others", is one of Father
        Galaktions core messages. He lives as a hermit on the holy mountain. Not
        all monks, however, live as secluded and demure as Father Galaktion. The
        film team is also received by Father Epiphanios - a gifted and poetic
        cook who certainly does not disdain the pleasures of
        life.</image:caption
