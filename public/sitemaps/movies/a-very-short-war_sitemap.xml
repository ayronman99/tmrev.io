        >"A Very Short War" is a deeply personal story, exploring the
        ramifications of loss. It follows the short life of early Australian
        aviator, Cliff Carpenter, using his narrative as a template to speak for
        all lives senselessly lost in wartime conflict. The documentary climaxes
        in the skies over Oslo, Norway as two Messerschmitt Bf110's attack a RAF
        Sunderland Flying Boat. Nine airmen perish and one miraculously
        survives. The story is told through the eyes of Bill Young, the nephew
        Cliff would never know.</image:caption
