        >This film is about the relationship of a mother and her daughter, the
        split-up of their family, the blessing and curse of belonging together
        and about coming of age - all this from the perspective of the young
        girl Aglaja. The story is based on real-life events, an Eastern European
        circus artist family that fled to the West. If they want to stay in the
        circus business they have to make up an exotic act. The mother spends
        all their money to buy a very dangerous act: hanging by her hair high up
        in the dome of the circus while juggling with burning torches. Every
        night Aglaja is terrified by the fear of losing her mother. But, on some
        day, she has to follow the family tradition and become the "Woman with
        the Hair of Steel".</image:caption
