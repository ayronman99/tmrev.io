        >Author/historian David McCullough welcomes viewers into his public and
        private world in this film. Produced by Tom Hanks and Gary Goetzman--who
        adapted McCullough's 'John Adams' for the 7-part HBO miniseries--this
        documentary paints an affectionate, first-person portrait of the
        two-time Pulitzer Prize winner as he gives a speech and even visits his
        old Brooklyn neighborhood.</image:caption
