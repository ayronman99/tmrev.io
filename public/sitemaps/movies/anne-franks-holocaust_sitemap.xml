        >Anne Frank's world famous diary came to an abrupt end shortly before
        she and her family were discovered hiding from the Nazis in a secret
        annex at the top of Otto Frank's office building, on August 4, 1944.
        While her diary tells the story of Anne's life, the story of her death
        reveals the atrocities encountered by millions of Jews during the
        Holocaust. In a solemn remembrance of the horrors that Anne Frank and
        these millions of others suffered during the dark days of World War II,
        National Geographic Channel (NGC) takes viewers inside the concentration
        camps in a two-hour special. In keeping with NGC's tradition of
        unparalleled storytelling, Anne Frank's Holocaust incorporates new
        findings and rarely seen photographs to reintroduce the story of the
        massacre of Jews in one of the most comprehensive documentaries on the
        subject to date.</image:caption
