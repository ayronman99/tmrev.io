        >Andres Serrano (born August 15, 1950 in New York City) is an American
        photographer and artist who has become notorious through his photos of
        corpses and his use of feces and bodily fluids in his work, notably his
        controversial work "Piss Christ", a red-tinged photograph of a crucifix
        submerged in a glass container of what was purported to be the artist's
        own urine. This documentary explores the work and soul of this acclaimed
        artist & how he creates his haunting and explicit images. It takes us
        deep into Amsterdam and reveals the backdrops Serrano uses for what is
        one of his most confronting and moving collection based on all aspects
        of sex.</image:caption
