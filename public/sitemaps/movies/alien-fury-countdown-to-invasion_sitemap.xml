        >Set in San Diego, the movie follows the desperate acts of Bill Templer
        head of a covert defense agency perpetrating a terrifying fraud on the
        American public - involving the imminent invasion of aliens - by leaking
        to the press a satellite image of an alien armada poised to strike
        earth. As terror of an alien attack spreads, the President of the United
        States orders the launching of Peacemaker, a surveillance satellite
        retrofitted with a nuclear warhead. Templer's elaborate plot is
        threatened when police detective Kevin Anjanette discovers that the
        alien images were faked. To protect his scheme, Templer swiftly
        unleashes the lethal head of his security, Ava Zurich, onto Anjanette.
        But it's soon revealed that an alien force actually does exist and is
        poised to strike if Peacemaker is used. In order to protect mankind from
        total annihilation, Anjanette must race to abort the nuclear bomb that
        will trigger the alien attack.</image:caption
