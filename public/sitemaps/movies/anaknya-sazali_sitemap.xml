        >Sazali felt humiliated by his son Farid's behaviour and took steps to
        lead the boy to a "normal" life by referring him to a psychiatrist and
        hiring the "Bomoh" to cure him. But Farid takes an overdose of the pill
        because of Amat and his life changes completely. Farid becomes extremely
        confused and shameless. Sazali's frustration leads him to begin a
        relentless search for the solution. But unfortunately, Sazali
        accidentally swallows the pill.</image:caption
