        >Elation in Neustadt: by the means of a little witching, Bibi Blocksberg
        saved two kids from burning to death. While her mother Barbara, a witch
        of flesh and blood herself, is very proud of her daughter, father
        Bernhard, overworked and stressed, disapproves greatly of her
        supernatural antics. Then Bibi gets a message from Walpurgia, the senior
        witch: she is going to receive her crystel ball, that will make a "real"
        witch of her, early. Proudly, Bibi jumps up her broom to fly to the
        Blocksberg, the witches' headquarters. But Rabia, one of the few evil
        witches, aging in misery and with a secret, begrudges her all the
        glory...and her youth. And so Rabia sets off events that will soon make
        Bibi's life fall into pieces.</image:caption
