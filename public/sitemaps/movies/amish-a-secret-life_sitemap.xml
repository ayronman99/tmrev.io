        >Miriam and Dave Lapp are a charming young couple with a brood of
        adorable children. Dave works in and part owns a construction company.
        They are also members of the 'Old Order' Amish community in
        Pennsylvania,whose church forbids all technology - though Dave gets
        lifts to work in a car and the couple,by allowing themselves to be
        filmed,risk the wrath of church elders. Having outlined their
        traditional life-style to camera Miriam persuades several friends to be
        happily filmed and it becomes clear that the Lapps and other,younger
        Amish,believe that,having been rebaptized to allow a more open
        evangelical approach - risking excommunication thereby - they feel the
        need for a change in the community. The film ends as the family
        consolidates its dream to own their own farm.</image:caption
