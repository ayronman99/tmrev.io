        >Rukmini (Rekha) is well into her 40s and still unmarried. She lives
        with her orphaned niece, Padmini (Mallika Sherawat), and together they
        device a scheme to entrap wealthy men, like Monty (Paresh Rawal),
        relieve them of their money, abandon them, and move on to better
        targets. They do succeed for quite a while, assuming various disguises,
        and names, amassing a fortune, until Padmini falls in love with one of
        her targets, a young man named Raghu (Karan Khanna), and decides to call
        it quits. An unstable Rukmini, who owes money to Monty, decides she
        cannot go it alone and concocts a scheme that will force Padmini to give
        up on Raghu and re-join forces with her to go on philandering
        unsuspecting wealthy men.</image:caption
