        >Shot in black-and-white, this story told partly in flashbacks with
        excellent acting focuses on a cleaning woman and a teacher. She displays
        self-destructive behaviour as a result of a terrible tragedy. He is
        unhappy, has suppressed feelings and incessantly phones the council
        about all kinds of trifles. Where she seeks extremes, including
        excessive sex and lies, he is introverted. When these two damaged souls
        meet at work, a bond results and they go traveling together. But their
        inability to communicate breaks the vulnerable relationship and this
        again has tragic consequences.</image:caption
