        >Dither: The D.I.Y. Sound is not your conventional punk rock
        documentary. In this documentary we explore the ideologies created by
        cornerstones of the early punk community such as Ian Mackaye of Minor
        Threat, Fugazi and Dischord Records. But beyond that, we explore the
        communities and people that have adopted these ideologies and created
        their own version of what it means to be D.I.Y. This is not a
        documentary about just music, it's a documentary about the communities
        that surround the music and embrace it as a way of identification and
        brotherhood. But this documentary doesn't just ask questions about the
        culture, it asks questions about how it's possible to maintain a culture
        that is, at it's core, so opposite of the modern economic and social
        system.</image:caption
