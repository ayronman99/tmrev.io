        >Reporting from the frontlines of the Okanagan wildfires, Stan documents
        uncommon heroism on his blog while hoping for a big break that’ll make
        him a household name beyond Peachland. But when he’s unexpectedly

        revealed and his innocence is hardly assured?</image:caption
