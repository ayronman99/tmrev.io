        >Deuce Bigalow is a less than attractive, down on his luck aquarium
        cleaner. One day he wrecks the house of a gigolo and needs quick money
        to repair it. The only way he can make it is to become a gigolo himself,
        taking on an unusual mix of female clients. He encounters a couple of
        problems, though. He falls in love with one of his unusual clients, and
        a sleazy police officer is hot on his trail.</image:caption
