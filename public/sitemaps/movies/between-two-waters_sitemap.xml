        >Isra and Cheito are two brothers who have taken very different paths in
        life. When Isra gets released from prison and Cheito comes home after a
        long tour with the Marines, they both return to the island of San
        Fernando. The reunion of the two brothers will bring with it the memory
        of the violent death their father suffered when they were just boys; the
        need to get back on track with their lives and finally come to terms
        with what happened will bring them together again.</image:caption
