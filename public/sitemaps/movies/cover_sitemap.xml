        >When someone is murdered on New Year's Eve, the prime suspect is
        Valerie Maas, a church-going home-maker whose life unravels when she
        discovers that her husband of many years has been leading a double life.

        her husband's betrayal threatens to destroy all that they have
        known.</image:caption
