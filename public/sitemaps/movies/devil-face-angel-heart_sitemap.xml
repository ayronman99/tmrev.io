        >Lon is an assassin who is deformed. The only man he can trust is his
        brother, Kwan. When Lon kills a police officer, the officer's partner
        tries to go after him, but lets him go after seeing his face. Meanwhile,
        Lon falls for Wendy, the girlfriend of Lon's sadistic boss, Dragon. When
        Lon agrees to kill Dragon for Wendy, it's a setup. After the kill, Lon
        is hit by a car and plunges into the river. A year passes by. A new man
        named Michael arrives, working for Wendy. Meanwhile, the partner of the
        cop Lon killed is still on the case. He notices a resemblance of the new
        man to Lon. Is Michael the same person as Lon? If so, what is the
        motive?</image:caption
