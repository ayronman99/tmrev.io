        >Cha Ekan Cha is a 2013 Nepali comedy action film written and
        co-produced by Deepak Raj Giri and directed by Dinesh D.C..It includes a
        cast of Nepali television comedians like Deepak Raj Giri, Jeetu Nepal,
        Sitaram Kattel and Kedar Ghimire, this ought to be an outrageous and
        funny affair. However, with all the talents involved, the film makes no
        effort in offering anything substantial that would’ve complemented the
        already established brilliance of these people. It’s a film that is in
        dire search of a clear plot and stretches so far to feature length only
        through jokes and one-liners. Cha Ekan Cha received positive to mixed
        reviews from critics upon release. The film has been praised for its
        direction, cinematography, action sequences, exotic
        locations.</image:caption
