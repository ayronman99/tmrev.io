        >Baobao and Beibei are twins and live in Nanjing. When they were
        three-and-a-half years old, their parents were laid off. To secure their
        the children's future, their parents choose for Baobao and Beibei to be
        gymnast, because the school sports coach had praised them. In order to
        train sports stars, amateur sports schools conduct cruel training on
        young children. Parents also have to obey the coachâ€™s request and force
        their children to practice exercises. They believe that sports are a
        fair competition, and, as long as they are hard-hearted and push their
        children to the top, they will have bright prospects. Baobao and Beibei
        spent their childhood training like this. Their ideal is to participate
        in the Olympics, win gold medals for their country, and buy a house for
        their parents.</image:caption
