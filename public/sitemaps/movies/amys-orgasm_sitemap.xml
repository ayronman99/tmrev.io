        >Amy is a single 29 year old Jewish woman. She wrote a successful
        self-help book about how women can't truly be in love and experience
        "mental orgasm." Her parents and acquaintances always try to give her
        advice. Eventually, she breaks her celibacy and starts dating a radio
        shock jock, who is known for hitting on his bimbo guests. Of all men,
        will she find in him the true love she never believed in</image:caption
