        >A Documentary about Nikos Nikolaidis' work. Nikos Nikolaidis was an
        acclaimed film director and author from Greece. He is famous for
        creating controversial characters in his films that have a rebellious
        attitude towards the social and political status quo. He illustrates a
        dark and pessimistic present and future, but also providing ambiguous
        hope for the end when his heroes find their escape in death. His films
        are shocking and contentious, raising questions during times when
        political visions start to fade away. His filming was poetic, dynamic
        and aesthetically beautiful in order to present situations on edge and
        elicit his audience's feelings. The aim of this project is to transfer
        his dynamics in a documentary that will convey some of his messages and
        create a platform for exchanging opinions among filmmakers from all over
        the world, in an effort to decipher his universe and his symbols as
        reflections of his unique and rare personality.</image:caption
