        >Based on real events, and set in Rio de Janeiro, A Wolf at the Door is
        the nerve-rattling tale of a kidnapped child and the terror of the
        parents left behind. When Sylvia discovers her six-year-old daughter has
        been picked up at school by an unknown woman, police summon her husband,
        Bernardo, to the station for questioning. From that point on, the film
        takes increasingly sinister turns as it delves into the events that led
        to the girlâ€™s kidnapping. With plot twists that will keep the audience
        on the edge of their seats, A Wolf at the Door is a darkly disturbing
        journey into the extreme limits of the human capacity for obsession and
        revenge.</image:caption
