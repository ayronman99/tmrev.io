        >The American composer and teacher Milton Babbitt died Saturday, Jan. 29
        2011 at age 94. For years, New York-based journalist and filmmaker
        Robert Hilferty had been constructing a documentary on Babbitt. It was a
        quirky, loving look at a man regarded by many as a composer of
        "difficult" music. Hilferty left the film unfinished when he died in
        2009. Composer and former Babbitt student Laura Karpman has now
        completed Hilferty's film.</image:caption
