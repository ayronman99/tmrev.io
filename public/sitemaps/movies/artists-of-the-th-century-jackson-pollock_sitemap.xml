        >Born in Wyoming in 1912, Jackson Pollock became one of the most
        notorious artists that America ever produced. He developed a technique
        in which he would fix his canvas to the floor, drip and splash paint
        onto it, then use a variety of objects to manipulate the paint. With
        these innovative paintings, he became the front-runner of the Abstract
        Expressionist movement.</image:caption
