        >What if there was no one left on Earth but two lovers trapped in the
        hyper-dimension of a barren Texas Landscape? On a quest to chase the
        light, Will and Mia travel across vacated urban sprawl and into the
        country side. But things aren't working out quite right. Gravity seems
        elusive, shadows chase you and whispers drift in the vacant winds. One
        evening, Will's nightmares manifest into the seven rednecks and they
        begin their imminent arrivals and they answer to only one; The Black
        Dog. Upon realizing the deadly seven are feeding on their fears, Will
        and Mia forge their escape, Can these two lovers make it out alive and,
        if so, is that their destiny?</image:caption
