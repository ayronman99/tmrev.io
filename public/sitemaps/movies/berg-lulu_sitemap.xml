        >Since its premiere on 2 June 1937 in Zurich, Alban Berg's second opera
        "Lulu" has the reputation of being surrounded by scandals. On the one
        hand, this is due to the dubious character of the subject, the
        man-eating femme fatale, which Berg had taken from Frank Wedekind's two
        Lulu tragedies – "The Earth Spirit" and "Pandora's Box" – and combined
        into one opera libretto. On the other hand, Berg's window had (for
        personal reasons) repeatedly refused to have the opera completed, which
        was unfinished when Berg died. This video is of the unfinished two-act
        torso of "Lulu."</image:caption
