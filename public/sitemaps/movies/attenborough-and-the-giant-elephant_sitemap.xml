        >David Attenborough investigates the remarkable life and death of Jumbo
        the elephant - a celebrity animal superstar whose story is said to have
        inspired the movie Dumbo. Attenborough joins a team of scientists and
        conservationists to unravel the complex and mysterious story of this
        large African elephant - an elephant many believed to be the biggest in
        the world. With unique access to Jumbo's skeleton at the American Museum
        of Natural History, the team work together to separate myth from
        reality. How big was Jumbo really? How was he treated in captivity? And
        how did he die? Jumbo's bones may offer vital clues.</image:caption
