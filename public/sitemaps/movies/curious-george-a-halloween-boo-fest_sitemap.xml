        >Halloween is almost here and George can't wait for the festivities to
        begin: carving pumpkins, costume contests, and especially the Annual Boo
        Festival. Eager to get the festivities started, George and Allie visit
        Renkins' Farm to pick out the perfect pumpkin. There, they are told the
        spooky tale of the Legend of No Noggin. As the story goes, No Noggin is
        a hat-kicking scarecrow who appears on Halloween to kick people's hats
        off. On Halloween night, George and Allie are determined to get a
        picture of No Noggin and prove he's real once and for all. Will they be
        able to get the proof? Only the curious will find out!</image:caption
