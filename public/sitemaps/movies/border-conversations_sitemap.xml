        >In November 2021, people tried to enter the EU via Belarus and Poland,
        but the route turned out to be a death trap. All access points to the
        border region were blocked in order not to create an escape corridor.
        Men, women and children were stuck in no man’s land – in the middle of
        winter, in the middle of the forest, for weeks. The film follows Polish
        activists on their mission. They learn that humanitarian aid, just like
        the refugees themselves, comes up against borders.</image:caption
