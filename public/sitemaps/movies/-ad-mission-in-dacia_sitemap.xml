        >Year 141 after Christ, in the Roman province of Dacia. An unusual
        appearance of a comet is observed on the night sky. The astrologers
        think it is a bad sign that will bring misfortune and death. In these
        frightening days, a deadly epidemic among cantoned soldiers spreads in a
        Roman fort (on the border of Dacia Province). Doctors are overcome by
        the situation. No one knows the cause of this disease and the number of
        deaths is steadily increasing. Four Roman explorers, led by the
        experienced Centurion Marcus - (along with his comrades Aquila, Tertius
        and Nerva) is sent by the commander of the fort - Prefect Cornelius
        Fulvius on a special mission to the unknown and unconquered territories
        beyond empire's border, those ruled by the Free Dacians, to find an
        unusual solution to this plague.</image:caption
