        >Trailblazing their home country with 3 gargantuan shows, the current
        World #1 DJ’s Dimitri Vegas &amp; Like Mike brought their biggest and
        boldest concept to date to the city of Antwerp during the 3rd weekend of
        December. Completing 3 sold-out nights at the Sportpaleis Arena with
        their new production ‘Bringing The Madness 3.0’, and with fans flying in
        from all over the world, the brothers delivered an audio and visual
        feast in front of 60,000 illuminated and buzzing music lovers throughout
        the entire weekend’s proceedings. An enormous triumph by any musical
        artist’s standard, especially considering the vigorous way fans snapped
        up the initial run of 40,000 tickets in under 40 minutes – a feat
        previously seen only from the likes of iconic artists U2, Madonna,
        Coldplay and Beyoncé – encouraging the brothers to add an additional 3rd
        date to the run of shows and increase the total ticket volume for the
        opening weekend to an eye-popping 60,000 capacity.</image:caption
