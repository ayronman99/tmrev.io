        >Life is good for marketing professional Allison, she’s well on her way
        to earning a stellar promotion all while dating equally successful
        co-worker Bryce. Her biggest rival for the position, Vanessa, has the
        boss’ eye, but Allison has a plan. To win the promotion, she needs to
        impress her boss, Nathan, at their annual company retreat. Of course,
        she has a head start since she used to be a camp counselor. The only
        caveat, this year’s trip happens to be the site of Allison’s first
        heartbreak: her old camp. And who should still be working there but the
        handsome as ever ex-boyfriend who broke that teenage heart, Cody. But
        was it all a misunderstanding? Allison’s tasked with navigating not only
        the obstacle course but her relationships…past and
        present.</image:caption
