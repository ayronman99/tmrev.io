        >A seventy-year-old retired school headmaster informs his wife and
        daughters that he has Alzheimerâ€™s disease. They are all concerned, but
        react differently due to their individual situations. The family watches
        as the husband and father regresses due to the disease and loses his
        memory. Interestingly, there are sparkling moments of his life of which
        the man will not let go.</image:caption
