        >It's a blistering hot summer. Maciej Kornet is traveling around Poland
        with his 17-year-old daughter, Wiktoria. It's been only the two of them
        for years, always together. The route they take is determined by where
        tennis competitions are being held. She is the apple of his eye, while
        he's her entire whole world. At least until they're joined by Igor, a
        promising player who starts training with Maciej. As a result, Wiktoria
        opens herself up to new experiences.</image:caption
