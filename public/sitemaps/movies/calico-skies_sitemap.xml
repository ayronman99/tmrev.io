        >Self condemned to the immense and boundless prison of the Mojave
        desert, Phoenix leads a life of forced isolation, living by himself in a
        house as far away as possible from the rest of the world. Phoenix does
        one thing and one thing only: he digs holes. Every month he digs a hole
        in the middle of nowhere and buries something. The last stronghold of
        society stands with the man that frequently delivers his mail. When one
        day the delivery doesn't happen by the hand of his trustworthy mailman,
        but by that of the beautiful and quizzical Ariel, Phoenix's life derails
        in an escalation that leads him to dangerous consequences which will be
        impossible to escape.</image:caption
