        >Selim, a handsome and successful writer triggers an elaborate chain of
        events when he visits police headquarters to report his car stolen.
        There he runs into the bumbling Sergeant Fathy Abdel Ghafour, an old
        family friend who now works as a detective. When the meddlesome Sergeant
        Fathy insists on hiring a live-in housekeeper for his old friend,

        new housemaid, her thieving husband and the well-meaning
        detective.</image:caption
