        >Antonym is a slow-burning drama about human connection, told through
        the story of two women who come together to write a radio drama. Vain
        and self-centred Aya is forced to find a writing partner to work on the
        radio script she is developing. Heavily reluctant to collaborate, she
        partners shy co-worker Sachiko, who eagerly embraces the project.
        Peppered with coincidental occurrences and failed relationships, and
        powered by the friction and growing friendship between the women as they
        work on the script, Antonym is as much about the inevitability of human
        connection as it is about the necessity of it.</image:caption
