        >A Private Death tells of the great love story between Haya Schreiber, a
        sixth-generation Jaffa-born Jew and Tewfic Hanania, a Christian Orthodox
        Jerusalem-born Arab that began in 1930s Jerusalem. Tewfic Hanania was a
        wealthy man who came from Jerusalem's Arab aristocracy. Haya was a
        kindergarten teacher from an orthodox Jewish family. Making use of rare
        archival footage alongside excerpts from films made by Hanania during
        the 1930s and interviews with historians and family members, the film
        portrays life in Jerusalem during the British Mandate. The wealth of
        materials and this intimate story show how history can ultimately impact
        a private story and private death.</image:caption
