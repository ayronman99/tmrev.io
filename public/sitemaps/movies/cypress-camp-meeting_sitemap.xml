        >Cypress Methodist Camp Ground was established as early as 1794, when
        Bishop Asbury preached here. Serving crowds too large for church
        buildings or homes, the camp ground responded to both religious and
        social needs. A vestige of the Great Awakening in American religious
        life at the start of the nineteenth century, it has had uninterrupted
        use as a site for revivalism for almost 200 years. It is one of only a
        few camp grounds in South Carolina to still host annual week-long camp
        meetings.</image:caption
