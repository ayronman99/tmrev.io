        >11-year-old Eliza is the invisible element of her family unit: her
        parents are both consumed with work and her brother is wrapped up in his
        own adolescent life. Eliza ignites not only a spark that makes her
        visible but one that sets into motion a revolution in her family dynamic
        when she wins a spelling bee. Finding an emotional outlet in the power
        of words and in the spiritual mysticism that he sees at work in her
        unparalleled gift, Eliza's father pours all of his energy into helping
        his daughter become spelling bee champion. A religious studies
        professor, he sees the opportunity as not only a distraction from his
        life but as an answer to his own crisis of faith. His vicarious path to
        God, real or imagined, leads to an obsession with Eliza's success and he
        begins teaching her secrets of the Kabbalah. Now preparing for the
        National Spelling Bee, Eliza looks on as a new secret of her family's
        hidden turmoil seems to be revealed with each new word she
        spells.</image:caption
