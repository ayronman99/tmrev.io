        >Studying under a disciple ofÂ Aleister Crowley, the leader of an upper
        class group invokes a supernatural force that slowly devours the village
        of Marienbad and its inhabitants, threatening to spread beyond its
        geographical limits. The mayor from the town nearby commissions the
        building of a dam which would flood the valley and therefore submerge
        the village forever sealing the evil force under water after leader and
        his followers were incapacitated to be kept from escaping. However, fate
        ensured the leader's freedom as he remained in the depths when the
        waters covered Marienbad. Now 40 years later an array of disappearances
        and deaths in mysterious circumstances are threatening the town next to
        the reservoir that now covers Marienbad.</image:caption
