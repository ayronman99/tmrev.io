        >Camille was only sixteen and still in high school when she fell in love
        with Eric, another student. They later married and a child and were
        happy for a while. But now twenty-five years have passed and Eric leaves
        her for a younger woman. Bitter and desperate Camille drinks so much
        liquor at a New Year Eve's party that she falls into an ethylic coma and
        she finds herself... propelled into her own past! Camille is sixteen
        again when she wakes up this morning, her parents are not dead anymore
        and she must go to school, where she will meet her schoolmates and, of
        course, Eric. Is she going to fall for him again and... be miserable
        twenty-five years later? Or will she avoid him with the result never
        having her beloved daughter? Who ever said that time traveling was
        fun?</image:caption
