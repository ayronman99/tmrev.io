        >Emma Reynolds returns to Oliver's Well to celebrate Christmas for the
        last time with her siblings in the home they grew up in. After their
        parents recently passed, the siblings reluctantly agree to sell the
        family home on Honeysuckle Lane after the New Year, leaving Emma in
        charge of its belongings. While antiques expert Morgan Shelby appraises
        Emma's mother's collection, they find a hidden surprise in an antique
        desk that takes them on a journey to discover the power of love and
        family during the holidays.</image:caption
