        >On the island of Bougainville in Papua New Guinea, victims and
        perpetrators are coming together in traditionally based reconciliation
        ceremonies after a decade long civil war left the community bitterly
        divided. In the largest reconciliation ceremony yet to take, BBA follows
        fighters who have killed each others families as they come together to
        break bows and arrows in a traditional gesture of peace. On a more
        personal journey Francis Boisivere retrieves the bones of a chief he
        killed, ceremonially returning them to the bereaved wife, Immaculate
        Atorevi . He seeks forgiveness , she a release from the hatred she
        harbours.</image:caption
