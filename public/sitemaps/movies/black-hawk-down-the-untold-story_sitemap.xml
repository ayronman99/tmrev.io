        >Black Hawk Down: The Untold Story is a documentary film on the heroic
        efforts of the soldiers from the 2nd Battalion 14th Infantry Regiment,
        10th Mountain Division (2-14). These men demonstrated extraordinary
        courage, skill, and discipline as they fought their way into a “baited
        ambush” to rescue the special operations forces pinned down at the crash
        site of Super Six-One while also attempting a rescue at the crash site
        of Super Six-Four. Two soldiers from the 2-14 were killed and eighteen
        wounded in what many have described as the most ferocious urban combat
        since the Battle for Huế during the Tet Offensive in
        1968.</image:caption
