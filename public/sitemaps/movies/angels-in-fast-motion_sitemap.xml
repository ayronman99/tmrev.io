        >The unflinching tale of Maria, Allan and Steso, who are struggling for
        survival. Maria is a pusher frau, wandering restlessly among addicts,
        abusers and bikers in a relentless search for love. Allan has just
        returned from an ill-fated trip across the Pacific and must reclaim his
        life and stay clean, but ghosts from his past return to haunt him.
        Steso, the intellectual, god-forsaken and prophetic cynic, does his
        utmost to unite the two polar opposites that give meaning to his life:
        his girl and drugs. All three try desperately to make some sense of the
        madness, but how do you find meaning in the chaos that is life? And how
        do you find love if you can't recognize it?</image:caption
