        >Four friends take a cottage vacation in the dead of winter, seeking
        refuge from their busy urban lives, if only for one weekend. However,
        the few residents who remain in the secluded cottage town of Rideau
        Ferry don’t seem to take kindly to strangers… From the moment they reach
        their destination, the visitors, a group of twenty-something artist
        types, are confronted by the ominous gaze of neighbouring cottagers, all
        of whom have no choice but to tough out the cold winter in this small,
        rural town. Over the course of their stay, the friends begin to uncover
        dark details about the inhabitants of the houses around them. After one
        of the friends is found mutilated on the front porch of a nearby
        cottage, the friends quickly discover that nothing is what it
        seems.</image:caption
