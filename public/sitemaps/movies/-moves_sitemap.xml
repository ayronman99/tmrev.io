        >20 Moves is the story of how the best-selling puzzle toy came to market
        and the impact it had on the world around it. Tom Kremer stumbled upon
        an unwanted, unpatented puzzle game at the Nuremberg Toy Fair in 1979.
        It had been invented in Hungary in 1974 by Professor Erno Rubik who used
        it as a pedagogical aid for his architecture students and would go on to
        be played with by 1/5th of the world's population. We explore the cube's
        story - from its creation behind the Iron Curtain to the role it played
        in the fall of communism and the creation of free market trading in the
        former communist nations. We show how the cube was brought to the west -
        how it was introduced and marketed and what caused it to be the biggest
        fad of the 1980's. The cube would go on to symbolize an entire
        generation like nothing before it. The many faces, layers, and sides of
        20 Moves is exactly like the cube. With each act our audience discovers
        another twist, another turn, another solve in the history of the
        Cube.</image:caption
