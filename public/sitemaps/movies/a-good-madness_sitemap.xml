        >This feature documentary captures the essence of the woman and power of
        the dance created by Rachel Browne (1934-2012), Canadian modern dance
        icon and founder of Canada's oldest professional modern dance company,
        Winnipeg's Contemporary Dancers. The film seeks a visceral and visual
        understanding of Rachel Browne, through her body of dance work, the
        bodies and souls of the artists who have danced with her, and through
        her voice and that of her family. Despite challenges and personal
        trauma, and because of them, Rachel Browne chose to survive and to
        adapt, exposing a raw desire to create dance to the exclusion of all
        else.</image:caption
