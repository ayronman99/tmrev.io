        >Is. This. My. Son? No matter how often Tobias Wilke poses this
        question, there's always only one answer: Yes! Tobias, can't believe his
        eyes when he comes to the airport to pick up his 17-year-old son Finn â€“
        and learns that Finn is now calling herself Helen and wearing girls'
        clothes. Finn/Helen reveals that she's always was a girl, and that she
        used her year abroad in San Francisco to pass the "everyday life" test.
        This is required by law for everyone preparing for the sex reassignment
        surgery they will undergo upon reaching majority. Reactions from Helen's
        friends, acquaintances and schoolmates cover the entire gamut from
        derision to solidarity. Especially Helen's father, a well-known chef,
        finds it difficult to accept a situation he cannot understand. But Helen
        nearly always finds the right words - and humor - to counterbalance the
        ignorance and jeers of those around her. It is the beginning of a long,
        winding road towards the sexual identity she is convinced is
        hers.</image:caption
