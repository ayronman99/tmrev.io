        >Ryan is a struggling son dealing with a constant internal battle
        regarding the inevitable loss of his Mother, and Sunny is desperate to
        escape the suffocating life that is depicted for her by her overbearing
        parents due to her being on the Autism spectrum. Both characters (and
        subsequently estranged family members) find themselves car-sharing to a
        funeral in Scotland. They have 3 days to feel comfortable in each
        other's company while feeling comfortable in their own
        skin.</image:caption
