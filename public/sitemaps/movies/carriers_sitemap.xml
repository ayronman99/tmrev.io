        >A deadly virus has spread across the globe. Contagion is everywhere, no
        one is safe, and no one can be trusted. Four friends race through the
        back roads of the American West on their way to a secluded utopian beach
        in the Gulf of Mexico where they could peacefully wait out the pandemic.
        Their plans take a grim turn when their car breaks down on an isolated
        road starting a chain of events that will seal their
        fates.</image:caption
