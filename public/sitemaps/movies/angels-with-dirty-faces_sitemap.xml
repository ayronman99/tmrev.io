        >In New York, the boys Rocky Sullivan and Jerry Connelly are best
        friends and small time thieves. After a robbery, Rocky is arrested and
        sent to a reformatory school, where he begins his criminal career. Jerry
        escapes and later becomes a priest. After three years in prison, Rocky
        is released and demands the return of $100,000 deposited with his
