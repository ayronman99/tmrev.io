        >"Beyond the Gates" is a feature length documentary film experience
        about the Waodani Indians and the missionary men and women who have
        given their lives to reach them. This powerful emotional journey begins
        with the Waodani describing their way of life before the missionaries
        visited them in 1956. Narrated by the son of one of the missionaries and
        each of the wives of the men who died, the audience takes a nostalgic
        trip back in time to see how the men and women came to meet up with each
        other in Ecuador. An inspiring story of forgiveness and
        love.</image:caption
