        >A documentary filmmaker goes out to document August, since he believes
        that this month constitutes a metaphor of whatever is hateful in the
        State of Israel. Yet while doing so he himself becomes August. "August"
        is a partly documentary and partly fictional film that portrays a month
        in the life of a filmmaker and his wife. He wishes to document the month
        of August, since he believes that this month constitutes a metaphor of
        whatever is hateful in the State of Israel. She, on the contrary, is
        rather fond of August, which represents to her all that is
        optimistic.</image:caption
