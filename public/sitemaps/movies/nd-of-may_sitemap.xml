        >Sam wakes up, gets ready and goes to do his daily job. And then the
        unexpected happens. A bomb explodes in the center of the shopping mall
        where he works. He drags himself towards the entrance to save the
        victims. One by one he pulls them out, until something terrible takes
        place. In complete hysteria he runs off till he falls down from
        exhaustion. A woman's voice makes him raise his head. She's one of the
        victims he saved. She wants to know why the suicide bomber did it. This
        encounter projects him back in history and even in a surreal world.
        Thereafter he runs into everyone he saved and feels that their defeat
        shows many parallels with his own. Even his confrontation with the
        wrongdoer isn't that straightforward as he thought it would be and
        confronts him with the fact that guilt and innocence can be pretty much
        alike.</image:caption
