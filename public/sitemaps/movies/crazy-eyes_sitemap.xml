        >Zack is a young, divorced father who starts to develop romantic
        feelings towards his friend Rebecca, whom he refers to as "Crazy Eyes".
        He spends a lot of time at a bar run by his best friend Dan Drake and
        hanging out with Autumn. As he pursues a sexual relationship with
        Rebecca, Zack grows increasingly aware of the importance of his son's
        role in his life amidst the failing health of his own
        father.</image:caption
