        >The film Brilliant City was produced during a stay in Shanghai with the
        British Council’s Artist Link Program. The title refers to the name of
        the location, a residential complex comprised of 25 high-rises in the
        northern part of Shanghai. It is entirely shot from the 34th floor of
        one of the buildings and stages a peeping tom view of the surrounding
        city, capturing everyday activities that can be observed from this
        vantage point – training soldiers, building activity, traffic,
        gardening.</image:caption
