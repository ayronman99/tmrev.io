        >Barbara is about to travel to Spain for an exhibition of her paintings.
        The night before starting her journey there is a hurricane and she has
        to stay in a nightclub until the morning. During the night she comes
        into contact with different people who have a variety of conflicts and
        interests. She is drawn into this microcosm which seems to be a
        reflection of Cuban society today.</image:caption
