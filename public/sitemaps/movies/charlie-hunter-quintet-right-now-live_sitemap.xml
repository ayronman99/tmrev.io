        >Recorded in winter of 2002 by 1k Studios when idiosyncratic guitarist
        Charlie Hunter was still working with his Quintet. Its semi-animated
        graphics format conveys more than a little of the whimsy and infectious
        spirit in the eight-string guitarist's music, even as the bios of the
        individual band members and production credits thoroughly cover the
        academic side of this project. The segment featuring Charlie solo is a
        great opportunity to see how he plays his custom-designed guitar. You
        have to marvel at what a self-deprecating musician this Bay-area native
        is, but never more so than on "Recess," where he refuses to show off or
        flaunt his technique in any way.</image:caption
