        >Henelotter up's the ante in the final part of his trilogy by
        introducing a new member to the family; the potentially monstrous fruit
        of hideously deformed Belial's loins. With the pair still enjoying
        relative anonymity and comfort in their new found home (presided over by
        Granny Roth), things however take a downward turn on a trip to the
        Georgia Clinic of Uncle Hal, which leads to an encounter with an
        especially nasty redneck sheriff and his similarly blinkered band of
        merry men.</image:caption
