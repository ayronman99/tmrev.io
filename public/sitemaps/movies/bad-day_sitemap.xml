        >Rebecca Ryan has been working as an undercover agent for the Organised
        Crime Division (OCD) posing as a taxi driver, while investigating
        London's south-side mob. When she finds her young daughter Lynn brutally
        murdered she fears her cover has been blown wide open, so she turns
        renegade and begins a brutal campaign of vengeance against the mob she
        believes killed her daughter. As she trawls the seedy depths of London's
        underworld hunting down her daughter's killers, the lines between good
        and evil, right and wrong begin to blur as do her notions of justice and
        revenge. It falls to the world-weary OCD agent Darius Cuise and his
        newly-assigned, hot-tempered partner Abby Barrett to track down Rebecca
        and bring her in before all hell breaks loose.</image:caption
