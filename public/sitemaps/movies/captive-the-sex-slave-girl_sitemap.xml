        >The astounding story of Tanya Kach made international headlines when
        she revealed she had been living in captivity for 10 years, just a
        stone's throw from her home. True Stories gains key insight into how a
        14-year-old girl vanished without trace, only to resurface a decade
        later, still living within the same community. Her school security
        guard, Thomas Hose, a man 24 years her senior, had kept Tanya as his sex
        slave, occasionally letting her out of the house into town after four
        years, yet no one in their small community recognised her as the missing
        girl. Now, with exclusive access, Tanya Kach recounts her 10-year hell
        and, for the first time, the many sides to this disturbing and tragic
        story are told through the key characters, including Tanya's estranged
        family, her high school friends and the police who worked on the missing
        person investigation.</image:caption
