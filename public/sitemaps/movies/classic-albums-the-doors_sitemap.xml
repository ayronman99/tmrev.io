        >A future classic was unleashed in January 1967 as the Doors released
        their eponymously titled debut album. This documentary in the Classic
        Albums series takes an in-depth look at the album, with commentary from
        Bruce Botnick, who worked on the album, and the three remaining
        Doors--guitarist Robbie Krieger, keyboard player Ray Manzarek, and
        drummer John Densmore. The three band members also play some of their
        instrumental parts from the album, offering invaluable insight into how
        the songs were constructed.</image:caption
