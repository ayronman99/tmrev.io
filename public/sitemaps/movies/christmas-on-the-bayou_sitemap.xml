        >When successful New York marketing executive Katherine discovers her
        workaholic ways are taking a toll on her eight-year-old son, Zac, she
        decides to spend Christmas with him and her mother, Lilly in her home
        town on the bayou. When Caleb tries to rekindle a childhood romance and
        convince her to move back home, Katherine is torn between the bright
        lights of the big city and the quiet, gentler rhythms of her Southern
        roots. Only a Christmas miracle orchestrated by Papa Noel can steer her
        heart to her true home.</image:caption
