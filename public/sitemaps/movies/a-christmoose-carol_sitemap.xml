        >A bullied young boy befriends a flying, talking moose that crashed
        through his ceiling after a test-flight with Santa went terribly awry in
        this holiday film for the whole family. But later, just as Mr. Moose and
        Beril strike up a friendship, the young boy's nefarious landlord Mr.
        Pannecke decides a mounted moose head would make a fine new addition to
        his trophy wall. But Santa has other plans for Mr. Moose, and when he
        turns up looking for his lost pal, Beril is faced with the prospect of
        losing his one and only friend.</image:caption
