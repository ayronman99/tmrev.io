        >In her quest to uncover the wrongdoings of the Russian authorities,
        Anna Politkovskaya inspired awe in some and fear in countless others. At
        age 48 she was assassinated for simply doing her job. This documentary
        is based on Anna's conversations with filmmaker Marina Goldovskaya,
        Anna's former university professor and personal friend. Shot over a
        period of 20 years, this exclusive footage creates an incredible story
        of a woman who consciously gave her life for her
        convictions.</image:caption
