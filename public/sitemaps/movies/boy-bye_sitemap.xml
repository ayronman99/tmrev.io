        >Veronica Love seems to have it all...she's smart, sassy and sexy and
        has a career as one of the most successful real estate entrepreneurs in
        California. Affectionately known as Love by her girlfriends Beverly and
        Charity, Love also happens to be happily single and loving every minute
        of it. She has no shortage of flings with the many boy toys and
        playthings that cross her path all because she doesn't believe in true
        love. Enter the sexy and mysterious business acquaintance Lance
        Peterson. Love has never felt this way about any man before and thinks
        that he could possibly be "the one" as their feelings for one another
        grow deeper by the moment. Lance is harboring a few tightly-wound deep
        secrets of his own that soon unravel and are revealed to her. Will his
        shocking revelation be enough to bring Love's world crashing down around
        her or will Love be able to survive his secrets with her heart still
        intact?</image:caption
