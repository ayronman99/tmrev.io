        >In 1926, Buster Keaton was at the peak of his glory and wealth. By
        1933, he had reached rock bottom. How, in the space of a few years, did
        this uncontested genius of silent films, go from the status of being a
        widely-worshipped star to an alcoholic and solitary fallen idol? With a
        spotlight on the 7 years during which his life changed, using extracts
        of Keatonâ€™s films as magnifying mirrors, the documentary recounts the
        dramatic life of this creative genius and the Hollywood
        studios.</image:caption
