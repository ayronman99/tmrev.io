        >When Gary Emerson reconnects with his high school girlfriend Valerie
        over a kiss at their reunion, he has no idea that Valerie took that kiss
        as in invitation to rekindle their youthful romance and has followed him
        cross-country to fan the fire of their old flame. Gary makes it clear
        that he and his wife Jenna are working on their marriage and that he
        will never love Valerie. This is unacceptable to Valerie, and now Jenna
        and Gary must fight for their lives and the safety of their two children
        while Valerie seeks retribution in her reign of terror. Natasha
        Henstridge, Marguerite Moreau, Jason Gerhardt, Sammi Hanratty star.
