        >After years together, Petr and Hana, partners in work and in life,
        share their unspoken erotic fantasies. What begins as an innocent
        conversation gradually turns into curious experimentation with a
        non-monogamous approach to their relationship. But sexual freedom tastes
        differently for each of them. Without resorting to exploitation, Tomasz
        Wiński’s feature debut considers questions that are taboo for many
        couples. Borders of Love explores not only various forms of intimacy but
        also ways of depicting it on the big screen, since, among others, the
        protagonists themselves film each other on their mobile phones.
        Appearing in the main roles are Matyáš Řezníček and Hana Vagnerová, who
        collaborated on the film’s story and script as well.</image:caption
