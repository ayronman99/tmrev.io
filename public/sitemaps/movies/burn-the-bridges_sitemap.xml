        >Eugenia is a former pop singer who is bedridden and dying of cancer.
        She is cared for by her daughter, Helena, who dreams of traveling the
        world and wishes she could be a glamorous pop star like her mother was.
        Helenaâ€™s younger brother Sebastian's dreams are simple and he merely
        wants to move to the beach. Helena is smart and pretty but she has no
        friends, male or female and is totally devoted to her mother's care and
        is also on the verge of initiating an incestuous relationship with
        Sebastian. Sebastian however, is falling in love with a boy at school
        named Juan who is the school roughneck and the son of a single father
        who owns a little bar. Juan is the nemesis of the school preppy named
        Ismael who comes from such a wealthy home that he has his own chauffeur
        and bodyguards. Ismael's ping-pong obsessed girlfriend Aurora rents a
        room at Helena and Sebastian's house where Ismael discovers he is also
        attracted to Sebastian.</image:caption
