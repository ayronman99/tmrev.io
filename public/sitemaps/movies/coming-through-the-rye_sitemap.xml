        >Coming Through the Rye, set in 1969, is a touching coming of age story
        of sensitive, 16 year old Jamie Schwartz, who is not the most popular
        kid at his all boys' boarding school. Disconnected from students and
        teachers, he believes he is destined to play Holden Caulfield, the main
        character of The Catcher in the Rye, and has adapted the book as a
        play.</image:caption
