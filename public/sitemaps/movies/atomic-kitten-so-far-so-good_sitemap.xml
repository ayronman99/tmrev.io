        >This fun documentary chronicles the humble beginnings and chart-topping
        successes of British pop supergroup Atomic Kitten. On the verge of being
        dropped by their record company, the girls made a major comeback with
        their hit single "Whole Again." In addition to interviews and
        behind-the-scenes footage, this program features videos for "Whole
        Again," "Right Now," "See Ya," "I Want Your Love," "Follow Me," "Eternal
        Flame" and "You Are."</image:caption
