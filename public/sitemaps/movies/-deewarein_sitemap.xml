        >Three men are on death row. Jaggu (Jackie Shroff), a lawyer and a poet,
        is serving a sentence for murdering his wife because she was cheating on
        him with another man. Nagya (Nagesh Kukunoor), a man angry with the
        whole world, is arrested for murdering his wife too, but he claims that
        it was an accident where she falls off the sidewalk while they were
        talking. Ishaan (Naseeruddin Shah), a happy-go-lucky man, is also
        arrested for murder that he commits while in the act of robbery. The
        prison's custodian is Mohan (Gulshan Grover), who attempts several
        methods to reform the prison's inmates. A documentary filmmaker,
        Chandrika (Juhi Chawla) comes to the jail to set a film about these
        three men. In the process, she finds redemption to her troubled
        marriage.</image:caption
