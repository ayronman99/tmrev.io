        >Berenice is a dedicated female taxi driver in Rio de Janeiro. She is
        consumed by her job and the little free time she has needs to be divided
        between raising her son Thiago, a teenager exploring his sexuality, and
        her troubled relationship with her husband Domingos, a police reporter.
        The scars of the worn-out relationship, ruined by her husband's violent
        outbursts, have erased her femininity and led her into a great
        existential emptiness. The murder of Isabelle, a beautiful transgender
        woman, on Copacabana Beach, ignites her investigative side and
        transforms her life.</image:caption
