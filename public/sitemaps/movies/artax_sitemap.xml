        >Mariana is a woman who has dedicated her entire life to equine therapy
        that goes over the history of how she came to that. In her youth she
        lived a happy and prosperous life until a particular episode leads her
        to have to face millionaires debts. This situation can lead to being
        left homeless and especially without their horses, among which stands
        out Artax, the only being with which his son Bruno with Asperger's
        syndrome manages to have a special bond that helps him to cope with his
        life with harmony. Mariana must fight against wind and tide in this
        story of struggle and resilience sustained by the love of a mother and
        her son.</image:caption
