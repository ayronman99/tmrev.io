        >The film marks 50 years since riots erupted across Northern Ireland,
        widely seen as the beginning of the thirty-year conflict known as The
        Troubles. Mark Cousins – who left Belfast at 18 – returns to his
        hometown to reflect on how the place and its history have been used and
        occasionally abused by cinema. He traces how the legacy of division has
        impacted on the nation’s cinematic imagination; and, in a city that once
        had one of the highest rates of movie-going in the UK, he scrambles
        around the ruins of Belfast’s once-grand cinemas.</image:caption
