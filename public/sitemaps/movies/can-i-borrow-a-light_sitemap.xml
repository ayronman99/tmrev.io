        >A thoughtful young man ambles around the Han River, providing an
        expansive setting for his contemplations. During a telephone call on the
        Jamsu Bridge, connecting the districts of Yongsan-gu and Seocho-gu in
        Seoul, he discovers his umbrella has been lost by the girl he lent it
        to, and judging by his disappointed reaction, we can see he is hurt at
        being forgotten. Another lost soul is on this bridge, a man with a
        guitar asks for a light and a song. Soon the young manâ€™s problems are
        put into context, when arguments about umbrellas seem to fade into
        meaninglessness.</image:caption
