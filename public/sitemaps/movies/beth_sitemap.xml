        >The story takes place in a mental hospital. Many things are going on.
        There is Pesta (Bucek Depp), a junky who was moved from a prison to the
        hospital. He meets Beth (Ine Febriyanti), the daughter of a high-ranking
        government official, who asked that her daughter gets a special
        treatment, but this must remain a secret. There are a poet, a politician
        and a nurse who was an ex-patient, and Bethâ€™s helper, also Rehan (Nurul
        Arifin) who has her own set of problems. The doctors at the hospital
        seem no different from the patients. There is also an artist who makes
        installation art works. His artistic doctrin is: the more complicated it
        is for a work of art to be understood, the better. It is unclear if the
        artist is the hospital 's patient, because he is never inside of the
        hospital but is always in the courtyard.</image:caption
