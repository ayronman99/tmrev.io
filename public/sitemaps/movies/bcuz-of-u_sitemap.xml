        >This movie encloses three intertwining love stories of six different
        people through a vintage car: Ria and RJ share the perfect relationship
        until she chickens out on their wedding. Years after, she decides to win
        him back. But the indecisive and the new RJ is now the most sought-after
        model in town. He wants nothing of her anymore. Will their love prevail
        over the pain they cause each other? Cara never takes a chance on
        falling in love because she believes that it will only break her heart.
        That was until she meets Roni but only to find out that he is the kind
        of man she's been trying to avoid. Will she take the risk this time?
        Louie, a tourist guide, meets April a Korean girl who gets lost in the
        city and is left with no choice but to pretend that she is a famous
        actress in her hometown only to survive. Will it be possible for two
        very different individuals find home in one another?</image:caption
