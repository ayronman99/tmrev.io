        >Johnny is an art student in Nassau whose technique is perfect, but he’s
        creatively blocked. His teacher sends him off to the rural island of
        Eleuthera where he meets Romeo, a hot musician. They begin a clumsy
        dance of attraction and romance. Romeo has a fiancé and is identified as
        straight, but he’s been known to play with the boys on the side
        secretly. The Bahamas are bound by religious traditions that discourage
        homosexuality and end up forcing gay men into the closet. These
        characters are all bound together in this intense drama of love, family
        and secrets.</image:caption
