        >Filmed in the late summer of 1999, Cheap Trick: Silver is a 25th
        anniversary celebration of the Rockford, Illinois, band famous for
        marrying British Invasion-era pop hooks with the guitar crunch of the
        Who's Quadrophenia period. Shot on a sealed-off, Rockford street, the
        concert is an electrifying overview of high points from the group's
        discography. The songs plucked from each of their albums reveal a
        remarkable power-pop consistency over the long haul, despite the band's
        lengthy periods of commercial rejection and bare survival. Visibly
        thrilled, Cheap Trick soar here through monster hits ("I Want You to
        Want Me," "Dream Police") and milk every drop of emotion from masterful
        ballads ("I Can't Take It"). While stellar guests include Slash and
        Billy Corgan, it's the appearances by less famous folk (the Rockford
        Symphony Orchestra, a few offspring of guitarist Rick Nielsen and singer
        Robin Zander) that movingly underscore the populist glories of this
        American band.</image:caption
