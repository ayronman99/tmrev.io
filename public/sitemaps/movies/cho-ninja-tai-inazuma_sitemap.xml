        president of Magical TV to allow her to create her life's work, Ch≈ç
        Ninja Tai Inazuma!, based on the long-standing legend of a legendary
        lightning that bestows powers upon those struck by it. However, because

        convinces her to turn it into a reality show by traveling back to 1720
        in the Edo period and picking three extremely inept locals and force
        them through humiliating training to become ninja.</image:caption
