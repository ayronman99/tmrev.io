        >When two carloads of friends were headed to Florida the only thing on
        their minds were sex, booze, drugs, and rock and roll. When a case of
        engine trouble sidelines the group in rural Maryland it begins a
        downward spiral into heinous acts of killing and depravity. One by one
        they encounter something in the woods, an abomination of nature and
        science. These friends wanted a trip they would never forget and that is
        exactly what they got when their trip turned into a... Deadly
        Detour.</image:caption
