        >It was the sister ship of the infamous Titanic... and its final destiny
        was the same. Experience the true untold story of Britannic, a
        tumultuous, epic voyage of human passion, courage and betrayal aboard an
        ill-fated ocean liner bound for a shattering demise. With the world at
        war, an undercover British agent (Amanda Ryan), embarks the Britannic in
        search of a German spy believed to be on board to sabotage the ship.
        Posing as a governess, the undercover agent finds herself falling in
        love with the ship's chaplain (Edward Atterton). In a stunning
        discovery, the lovers suddenly find themselves enemies of war. And when
        a massive explosion deals a deathblow to the ship, their battle becomes
        one for their own survival. With a dynamic, international cast and a
        story line that hosts a chilling tale of espionage, politics and
        romance, Britannic brings one of history's most devastating events to
        riveting, new life.</image:caption
