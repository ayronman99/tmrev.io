        >Diogo and Emília have been together for 16 years. They have a teenage
        daughter and undergo a tedious phase. However, everything turns upside
        down when they find out their best friends, Ricardo and Bettina, have an
        open marriage. More than that: they are swingers, are super cool about
        this choice, and try to convince the other couple that it is possible to
        be quite happy with this liberal lifestyle. This news comes like a bolt
        from the blue. After reacting badly to the idea, Emília gets excited and
        convinces Diogo to, at least, go to a party with Ricardo and Betina's
        "gang". And that is when a series of events that will shake the couple's
        boring little life starts. Will they set their jealousy aside and become
        supporters of this practice?</image:caption
