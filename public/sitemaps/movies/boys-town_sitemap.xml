        >The devout but iron-willed Father Flanagan leads a community called
        Boys Town, a different sort of juvenile detention facility where,
        instead of being treated as underage criminals, the boys are shepherded
        into making themselves better people. But hard-nosed petty thief and
        pool shark Whitey Marsh, the impulsive and violent younger brother of an
        imprisoned murderer, might be too much for the good father's tough-love
        system.</image:caption
