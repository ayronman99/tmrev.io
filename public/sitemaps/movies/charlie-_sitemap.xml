        >Felix Bender (Nikita Wokurka) is an eleven-year-old orphan who lives
        with unloving foster parents. For five years he’s been waiting for his
        older brother to pick him up, but his hopes fade away with each year’s
        passing. On his eleventh birthday Felix gets a laptop from the only
        person who cares about him, his neighbor Rasmus. The man hopes that
        Felix would be able to get in contact with his brother through the
        internet, but during the first connection a little accident happens: a
        mouse runs over the keyboard and accidentally makes the laptop download
        a program that awakens the old car and gives that car a soul. Soon the
        boy and his car are being hunted by the owners of the program, who want
        to get it back and destroy the car.</image:caption
