        >Nasser-Ali, a talented musician, loses the will to live after his wife
        breaks his beloved violin during an argument. He searches for a
        replacement, and finding none that sounds quite the same, he vows to
        die. Eight days later, he does. This is the story of his last week of
        life, where we see flashbacks and flash forwards of his previous life
        and his children's futures. We also see appearances of a nude Sophia
        Loren as well as the angel of death, Azarel. As we see his life, we
        realize exactly why he chose to end it and the profundity of this
        choice.</image:caption
