        >In the Spanish island of Ibiza, porn filmmaker Sandro and Angelino, the
        manager of a beachside watering hole, find their very different lives
        overlapping. Meanwhile, the island police chief, who is currently at
        odds with his rebellious son Jorge, is investigating the death of a drug
        dealer (which was accidentally brought on by Angelino). Jorge's plans to
        move to America have so far been thwarted by his father, but when he
        finds out about the affair his dad had been having with a male nightclub
        dancer, he uses it as blackmail fodder.</image:caption
