        >Ever since the first Roma people arrived in Sweden five hundred years
        ago, they have been discriminated against and persecuted. The lack of
        knowledge, invisibility and denial of the historical abuses that Roma
        have been exposed to is one of the many contributing causes of continued
        marginalization and vulnerability of Roma today. Here, the Roma tell of
        the abuses and persecutions they experienced during the 20th century.
        How it felt like as a child being constantly expelled from the camp, not
        infrequently in the middle of the night, with violence and under
        gunfire. Soraya Post from the traveling group tells how her mother, as a
        pregnant 23-year-old, was forced to abort her child in the seventh
        month. The reason: She was a "gypsy".</image:caption
