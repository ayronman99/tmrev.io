        >Maria, daughter of Italian emigrants, lives with her son Santino who
        lives by expedients. In a small American town, inhabited mostly by
        children of Italian immigrants, the woman does everything to prevent her
        boyfriend from getting lost by taking the wrong path, so every time
        Santino tries to score a shot, Maria manages to blow his plans. Until
        one day the loving mother decides that the time has come to teach a
        fundamental lesson for the life of her son.</image:caption
