        >A fully automated commercial jetliner is prepared to make its maiden
        voyage. Without an on-flight pilot, the craft relies on satellite
        linking for its course. But when the plane suddenly deviates from its
        determined route and establishes a circular pattern over Seattle, it
        becomes evident that the craft has been hijacked by a disgruntled former
        airline employee who has hacked into the flight's computer system from
        his apartment, somewhere in the United States. Now, a former discredited
        Navy pilot and an oddball technician must race against the clock to find
        where the angry employee is, and regain control of the plane before it
        crashes into the city.</image:caption
