        >Echolalia is the meaningless repetition of words or phrases associated
        with forms of dementia and aphasia. In the build-up to the war in Iraq
        certain phrases were endlessly repeated to the point where these empty
        rhetorical phrases were confused with concrete facts. I tried to record
        as many instances of people repeating the phrase “weapons of mass
        destruction” as I could stand and represent these statements in a way
        that draws attention to the deadening effect of their repetition,
        however emphatically they are expressed.</image:caption
