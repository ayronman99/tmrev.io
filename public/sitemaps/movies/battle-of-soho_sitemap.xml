        >In November 2014 the Iconic club Madame Jojos closed its doors. This
        event being interpreted by many as the death knell of Soho.The
        gentrification of Soho affects the LGBT community and its Drag Queen
        sub-culture, but the cabaret atmosphere of the entire neighborhood in
        enormous ways. This active pursuit to destroy a bubbling and vibrant
        part of the city's heart is viewed by many as an atrocity akin to
        turning the lights off on Broadway. Over 3rd of London's music venues
        have been closed in recent years and no one noticed. An active movement
        to bring a halt to this disaster has begun to unfold with one
        organization after another emerging to fight for Soho. Organizations
        made up of citizens and celebrities have sprung up to combat this
        onslaught. Will they win this battle and save Soho?</image:caption
