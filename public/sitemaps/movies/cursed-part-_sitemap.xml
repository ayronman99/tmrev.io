        >A horror comedy that spoofs the narcissistic film director whose
        delusional vision of her badly written three page treatment (a direct
        ripoff of The Blair Witch Project), pages she feels are enough to make a
        complete movie. The director immediately loses its star (Donna Mills)
        and has to step into the female lead role herself. Not an actor, a
        beauty, or even a very good director, she is forced to face her
        limits.</image:caption
