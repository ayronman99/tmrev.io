        >Blues Story presents an impressionistic history of one of the most
        lasting art forms America has ever produced - as told for the first time
        through the eyes of the artists who lived it. Combining exclusive
        interview and performance footage with vintage clips and the music of
        many Blues legends long gone, the history of this richly felt music is
        illuminated - from its African roots to its American urban expression -
        along with its profound place in our cultural heritage. The result is a
        rare, first-hand glimpse into the lives of these vanishing artists, and
        a moving, insightful and informative look into a music that continues to
        be loved by millions throughout the world.</image:caption
