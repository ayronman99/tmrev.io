        >From July 21 through September 10th, 2007, the Museum for Contemporary
        Art Tokyo held an exhibition honouring Kazuo Oga, the art director and
        background artist for many famed works from Japan's Studio Ghibli. Over
        600 works from the artist were on display, and numerous fans flocked to
        the one-of-a-kind exhibition celebrating the lush, gorgeous background
        artwork typifying many a work from Hayao Miyazaki and other Ghibli
        filmmakers. International fans of Oga and Studio Ghibli have not been
        left out, however. A Ghibli Artisan - Kazuo Oga Exhibition - The One Who
        Drew Totoro's Forest allows fans the opportunity to attend the
        exhibition, as well as watch interviews and testimonials with Oga's
        contemporaries and collaborators, all subtitled in
        English.</image:caption
