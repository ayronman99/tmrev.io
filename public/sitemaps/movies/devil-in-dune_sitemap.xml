        >The film tells the story of a near future in which the earth is
        irreversibly sandy, as human emissions and rubbish exceed its carrying
        capacity. As plants and animals mutate to create the Earth's new
        masters, the "sand worms", which are slaughtering the planet and driving
        humans to the brink of extinction, the survivors are left to their own
        devices to find the only remaining refuge in the deep desert, the
        "Oasis". An exiled team of wealthy businessmen, scientists, security
        chiefs, mechanic families and gangsters set out on an adventure to find
        the Oasis in a special armoured vehicle, but the bloodthirsty insects
        are hot on their heels.</image:caption
