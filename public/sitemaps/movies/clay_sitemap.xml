        >This film explores the idea of the consistency of land use over time.
        In the exact location of where the filmmaker is living and realizing
        this project, trypillian people lived over 5,000 year ago. A modern day,
        post soviet brick factory in the village uses the exact same process to
        make bricks that the trypillian people used to make pots. Through this
        same process, and the unexplained burning of the trypillian homes, we
        have fired clay remnants of their presence in this village in very large
        numbers. A reknowned local archeologist talks about these people and
        their relationship to land, clay and black gold.</image:caption
