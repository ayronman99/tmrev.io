        >On April 4-5,2000, Delores Stevens and the Ives String Quartet became
        the first chamber music ensemble to have their performance of the Brahms
        Piano Quintet recorded, mixed and mastered at 96kHz/24bits. The
        recording took place in Zipper Auditorium at the Colburn School of
        Performing Arts in downtown Los Angeles. With high-resolution Euphonix
        equipment capturing 16 channels at 96kHz/24bits and five locked off
        cameras trained on the performers, one of the most well known chamber
        music works became the first project for AIX Records.</image:caption
