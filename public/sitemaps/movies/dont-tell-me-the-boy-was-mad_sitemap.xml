        >Aram, a young man from Marseille of Armenian origin, blows up the
        Turkish ambassador's car in Paris. Gilles, a young cyclist who was
        passing at that precise moment, is seriously injured. Aram's mother
        feels guilty and feels the need to visit Gilles at the hospital and beg
        for his forgiveness, something that Gilles does not understand. Against
        the advice of his comrades in Beirut, Aram decides to go meet his
        victim.</image:caption
