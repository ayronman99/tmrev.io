        >City of the Century chronicles Chicago's dramatic transformation from a
        swampy frontier town of fur traders and Native Americans to a massive
        metropolis that was the quintessential American city of the nineteenth
        century. The film tells how innovation, ingenuity, determination and
        ruthlessness created empires in what was a marshy wasteland and
        describes the hardships endured by millions of working men and women
        whose labor helped a capitalist class reinvent the way America did
        business. Along the way, this program revels in Chicago's triumphs --
        among them the architectural experimentation that gave the city one of
        the world's most distinctive skylines -- and delves into the heart of
        Chicago's painful struggles. Bringing to life the Windy City's rich
        mixture of cultures, its writers and journalists, its political
        corruption and labor upheavals, this film bears witness to the creation
        of one of the most dynamic and vibrant cities in the
        world.</image:caption
