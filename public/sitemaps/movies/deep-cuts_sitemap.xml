        >Set in present-day Los Angeles, Deep Cuts is a black comedy surrounding
        an average 20-something guy named Sal, who's recently been diagnosed
        with cancer. In the midst of his treatment, losing his hair,
        chemotherapy, depression and loss, Sal realizes his time is limited and
        the opportunity to seize his moment is fleeting. Forgoing what the world
        may think, Sal follows the passion he's always had: becoming a rapper.
        Under the alias "Deep Cuts" and with the help of his therapist, Sal
        reaches out to an old acquaintance from high school that slowly morphs
        into a mentorship. Through this experience,a new life begins for Sal.
