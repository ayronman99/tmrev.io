        >James Bernard Jr., a.k.a. Dutch, has become the most dangerous criminal
        in New Jersey. From his early skill as a car thief, Dutch recognized the
        opportunity to rule the streets and he seized it. With both the
        protection and respect of the Mafia, Dutch becomes the most terrifying
        force on the streets. District Attorney Anthony Jacobs is determined to
        take down Dutch and his crew, and he's confident that his witnesses will
        testify against them.</image:caption
