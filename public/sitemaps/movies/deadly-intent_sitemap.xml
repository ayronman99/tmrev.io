        >After the tragic death of her husband, a soldier posted to Afghanistan,
        Bryony tries to build a new life for herself and her young son, James.
        Struggling with her own grief she fails to notice that James has become
        secretive and withdrawn, spending hours alone playing out death scenes
        with his toys. When things start to go missing and furniture is smashed
        Bryony blames James but when she confronts him she finds herself facing
        a reality more terrifying than any nightmare. As her world crashes
        around her Bryony realises that unless she can find a way to reconnect
        with her son she and James will be separated for ever.</image:caption
