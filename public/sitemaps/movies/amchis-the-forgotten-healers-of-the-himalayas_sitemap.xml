        >Zanskar is a valley tucked between the steep mountains on the border of
        the Himalayas, at an altitude of 3,700 meters. In each village in this
        remote area of the world, there is a traditional Tibetan medicine man
        named the "Amchi." Since the beginning of time, the Amchi has passed his
        knowledge down from father to son, or from teacher to student. With the
        construction of a new road, however, the valley was left vulnerable to
        the outside world. Since then, the younger generation has rejected the
        age-old wisdom and practices of the Amchi, embracing more modern,
        lucrative activities instead. As a result, these forgotten healers of
        the Himalayas are perhaps the last to practice Tibetan
        medicine.</image:caption
