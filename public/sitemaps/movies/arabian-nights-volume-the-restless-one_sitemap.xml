        >Every night, in danger of being beheaded, Scheherazade tells King
        Shahryar unfinished tales to continue them the following night, hence
        defying his promise of murdering his new wives after their wedding
        night. Scheherazade tells king Shahryar her stories but these are not
        those in the book. These are stories based on whatever will be happening
        in Portugal during the production time of the film. As in the book,
        these stories will be tragic and comical, with rich and poor, powerless
        and powerful people, filled with surprising and extraordinary events.
        This film will be about the reality of a disgraced country, Portugal,
        under the effects of a global economic crisis.</image:caption
