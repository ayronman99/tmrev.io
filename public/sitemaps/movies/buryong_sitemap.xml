        >A minute of a life. Bored to death. What is life? A series of moving
        stills. "Buryong" captures sixty-seconds-in-a-life, Philippine-time.
        From mundane chores, to work, to scenes of domesticity, to killing time,
        we are asked to observe and meditate on these moments. A lot can happen
        in the span of a minute. An entire lifetime even. Buryong is an epistle
        to time and to boredom. This could be your minute; this could be your
        life. How are you spending it?</image:caption
