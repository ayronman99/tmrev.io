        >Four young activists interview elder gay, lesbian and trans-gender
        activists who came out in the 1960s. They explore how the perfect storm
        of 1960s activism -- the anti-war, civil rights, and the women's
        movements -- inspired young LGBT people of the time to fight for their
        personal freedoms These were the years that led up to the Stonewall
        Riots in 1969, and the elders explain what the underground LGBT
        community looked like pre-Stonewall, and how the actions of young, angry
        activists boiled over and ultimately lead gave way to a national modern
        LGBT movement.</image:caption
