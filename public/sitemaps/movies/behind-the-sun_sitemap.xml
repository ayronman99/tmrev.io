        >Brazilian badlands, April 1910. Tonho is ordered by his father to
        avenge the death of his older brother. The young man knows that if he
        commits this crime, his life will be divided in two: the twenty years he
        has already lived and the few days he has left to live, before the other
        family avenges their son's death. He is torn between fulfilling his
        ancestral duty and rebelling against it, urged by his younger brother
        Pacu. That's when a tiny travelling circus passes through the vast
        badlands where Tonho's family lives.</image:caption
