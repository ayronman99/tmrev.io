        >Over the course of a four-year run, Bachman-Turner Overdrive sold in
        excess of 30 million records, earning a staggering 120 platinum, gold
        and silver discs, and notching up hits in more than 20 countries. The
        iconic duo shared duties on the lead vocals, with Bachman contributing
        lead guitar and Turner the bass. Reuniting at the end of 2009 they
        released an eponymous album in 2010, and in November of that year they
        performed at the famous Roseland Ballroom in New York City, as part of
        their North American tour.</image:caption
