        >Heading on a transatlantic voyage at sea from an Italian lab to
        America, D'Agostino is the story of a human clone left for dead at the
        shores of Santorini Greece. This lost cargo, commissioned by wealthy
        individuals for organ tranplants, is abandoned as the freight cannot be
        recovered. Allan Dawson has recently inherited his grandmother's island
        estate. He's in a loveless relationship with his common law spouse
        Sylvia. As he finds this interesting freight, what follows is a macabre
        tale of self realization as Allan proceeds to set himself out of his
        sedentary existence to mold his latest discovery into a new best friend
        with dire consequences.</image:caption
