        >APPROACHING THE ELEPHANT is a feature-length documentary about The
        Teddy McArdle Free School, where classes are optional and rules are made
        by democratic vote. Summerhill, founded 90 years ago by A. S. Neill, was
        the first free school - now there are more than 200 worldwide.
        Approaching the Elephant chronicles a free school in the making -
        spanning two years, from Teddy McArdle's first day when there were no
        rules or classes, through the changing of the school's director and the
        expulsion of a student by democratic vote, to the last day of the second
        year, APPROACHING THE ELEPHANT is an intimate portrait of a small group
        of people from a range of educational backgrounds, come together to
        forge a place where children are treated as equals, at liberty to spend
        their days however they please.</image:caption
