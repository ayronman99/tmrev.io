        >Sathyaraj dreams of marrying an educated employed girl, of building a
        dream house of his own, and having just one child. But the wife (Meena)
        he gets, thanks to the trick played by his scheming orthodox
        grandparents, turns out to be an illiterate rustic whose dreams are
        confined to marrying a swarthy man, having a dozen kids and visiting all
        the temples around. Soon all the dreams of the wife came true and the
        husband's dream was being destroyed one by one. Vadivelu hoodwinking his
        own wife (Kalpana) and carrying on unabashedly with his philandering
        activities is pedestrian comedy. So the husband was quite mad at the
        wife and his grandparents. Later his friend(Vadivelu) a hooker
        (Manthara) who develops a soft corner for him. Later the husband and his
        friend left their family and stayed at the hooker's house for a short
        period. In the end the husband went back to his wife and stayed
        happily.</image:caption
