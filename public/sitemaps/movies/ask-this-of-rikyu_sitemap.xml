        >Sen no Rikyu (Ebizo Ichikawa) is the son of a fish shop owner. Sen no
        Rikyu then studies tea and eventually becomes one of the primary
        influences upon the Japanese tea ceremony. With his elegant esthetics,
        Sen no Rikyu is favored by the most powerful man in Japan Toyotomi
        Hideyoshi (Nao Omori) and becomes one of his closest advisors. Due to
        conflicts, Toyotomi Hideyoshi then orders Sen no Rikyu to commit seppuku
        (suicide). Director Mitsutoshi Tanaka's adaptation of Kenichi Yamamoto's
        award-winning novel of the same name received the Best Artistic
        Contribution Award at the 37th Montr√©al World Film Festival, the Best
        Director Award at the 2014 Osaka Cinema Festival, the 30th Fumiko Yamaji
        Cultural Award and the 37th Japan Academy Film Prize in nine categories,
        including Best Art Direction, Excellent Film and Excellent
        Actor.</image:caption
