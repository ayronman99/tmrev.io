        >Dumpster tells the story of what happens when Jim, a janitor on the
        campus of an elite university, discovers Francis, a wealthy frat boy,
        hiding in a mobile garbage bin. Jim wrestles with adult responsibilities
        at home with his girlfriend and her child, while Francis struggles to
        overcome his roommate's suicide, getting 'dumped' by his girlfriend, and
        outgrowing the fraternity scene. Their late-night meetings at the
        Dumpster allow them to shed their labels and uniforms and find out how
        the other half lives, while discovering some good stuff in the
        dumpster.</image:caption
