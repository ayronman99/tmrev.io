        >When Hay was seven years old, he found a dead horse in an open field
        and watched his father and other adults struggle to get rid of it.
        Unsure of this memory, he is nonetheless very influenced by this
        incident and, when he cuts himself during a sacrificial rite, everything
        comes flashing back. Step by step, Hay goes down an inevitable and
        spiritual path where he confronts the relationship between human and
        nature, the unity of matter and the living.</image:caption
