        >Hyuk-Jin has just broken up with his girlfriend and decides to take a
        trip to Jeongseon in the province of Gangwon-do. The next day, his
        friends are too hung over to get up, so Hyuk-Jin makes his way to his
        destination alone. A trip of opportunity takes a cruel and unexpected
        turn as misunderstanding and crossed paths occur over and over
        again.</image:caption
