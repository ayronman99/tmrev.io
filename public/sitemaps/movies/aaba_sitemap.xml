        >An orphan girl staying with her grandparents comes across the news of
        her grandfather being in the advanced stages of lung cancer and would
        probably survive just a few weeks. With not much to do the grandfather
        spends rest of his days revisiting his personal possessions and digging
        his own grave. But then life has its own surprises and does not take the
        path we plan.</image:caption
