        >See first-hand what it was like for firefighters who witnessed the
        carnage and despair that terrorists wreaked on September 11, 2001. Mike
        Lennon, an FDNY retiree, went back to work to help dig for survivors and
        mourn with his brothers, documenting the historical events with his
        camera. Interspersed is a moving tribute to firefighter John Satore of
        Ladder 5, who died that fateful day and whose memory comes alive in an
        interview he did pre-9/11.</image:caption
