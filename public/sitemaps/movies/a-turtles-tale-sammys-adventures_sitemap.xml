        >A sea turtle who was hatched in 1959 spends the next 50 years traveling
        the world while it is being changed by global warming. Born on a Baja,
        California beach in 1959, new hatchling Sammy must do what his fellow
        newborn sea turtles are doing: race across the beach to the ocean before
        they are captured by a seagull or crab. Thus begins Sammy's incredible
        fifty-year ocean journey. Along the way he meets his best friend, a
        fellow turtle named Ray, and overcomes obstacles both natural and
        man-made while trying to fulfill his dream of travelling around the
        world. Throughout his voyage, Sammy never forgets about Shelly - the
        turtle he saved on his first day and loves passionately from
        afar.</image:caption
