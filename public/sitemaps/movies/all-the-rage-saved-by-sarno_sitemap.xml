        >America is experiencing an epidemic of pain. One man has the answer to
        the problem yet the medical establishment has ignored him. For nearly 50
        years, Dr. John Sarno has been single-handedly battling the pain
        epidemic by focusing on the mind-body connection and the nature of
        stress and the manifestation of physical ailments. With a renowned
        practice in rehabilitative medicine at NYU he is also a bestselling
        author of numerous books that deal with psychosomatic disorders.
        Filmmaker Michael Galinsky's family has a long history with Dr. Sarno
        and their experience will be woven into the fabric of the film,
        alongside well known patients, including Howard Stern, John Stossel,
        Jonathan Ames, Larry David, and many others.</image:caption
