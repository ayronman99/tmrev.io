        >Marcial is a simple country boy with a normal family and normal life,
        except for one small detail: his infant daughter, Mary, six years old,
        is autistic. But this disease really is no problem too big for the
        family of Martial. Despite the humility in which they live, Mary has a
        seemingly happy life. But everything changes the day that the autistic
        girl disappears and the media invade the peaceful village where the
        family lives. The mystery of the disappearance of the girl and the
        shadows that journalists spread over the father's attitude makes it a
        hell deeper anguish in which the family lives.</image:caption
