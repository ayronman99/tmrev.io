        >Blockade Leningrad, December 31. In the country house of the
        Resurrection, living "in a special situation," six people and a chicken
        gather, who no one can cook. Previously, the cook was engaged in this,
        but the Voskresenskys were taken away from her on the eve - hard times
        came on the outside, and the situation is also difficult inside: the
        youngest son brought a hungry girl, the eldest daughter of an unknown
        man for whom she is going to marry. Before the New Year there are few
        minutes left, and the number of problems grows snowball.</image:caption
