        >One morning in October 1988, Howard Wilkinson walked into history.
        History was Elland Road; the great football stadium in Leeds, built by
        the efforts of Don Revie; home to one of the greatest club sides in
        Europe, built by Don Revie. But on that morning, Leeds United were 21st
        in Football League Division Two, and now Howard Wilkinson was here,
        history had to go. He met his new employers, cracked jokes with the
        press, and got to work.</image:caption
