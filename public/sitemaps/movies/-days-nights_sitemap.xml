        >Xiaoyue finds that her mother has been working for a long time away
        from home when she receives the apples sent from her mother. Just
        entering her puberty, Xiaoyue comes from a new immigrant family from
        Vietnam. She is laughed at and bullied in school because her old father
        makes a living as a scrap collector. The rebellious Biyan always stands
        out for Xiaoyue. She even plans a three-day journey to see her mother
        with Xiaoyue. Ms. Chen is faced with a dilemma. She is going to retire
        but the after-school tutorial class in the community is the only place
        for her to care her students. For Xiaoyue and her friend Biyan, her
        class is their hope.</image:caption
