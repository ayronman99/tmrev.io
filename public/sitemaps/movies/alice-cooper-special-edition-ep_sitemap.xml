        >Alice Cooper, the king of shock rock, is an innovative showman - one of
        the most bizarre and entertaining rock attractions of all time. The
        inspiration and flamboyance of Alice Cooper did more than forever alter
        the face of rock 'n' roll as we now know it. He virtually invented rock
        as theatre, created new fashion trends, sparked a new sexual revolution,
        established higher standards for teenage decadence, and found time on
        top of all this to write and record a library of classic rock 'n' roll
        albums. This DVD EP captures Alice Cooper performing live at the peak of
        his career. The collection also features one of highlight tracks 'Public
        Animal #9' from the 1972 album 'School's Out' which catapulted Alice
        Cooper further into stardom.</image:caption
