        >On 3 April 2011, as he was boarding a flight to Taipei, the Chinese
        Artist Ai Weiwei was arrested at Beijing Airport. Advised merely that
        his travel “could damage state security”, he was escorted to a van by
        officials after which he disappeared for 81 days. On his release, the
        government claimed that his imprisonment related to tax
        evasion.</image:caption
