        >Three characters meet on a winter night at a bus stop and attend to the
        abandonment of a dog. Mila, a teacher who has been a year off after
        being attacked by one of his students. Celso, security guard, married,
        father of a child with serious economic problems, about to learn that is
        going to be father again, but this time with twins. And Valeria, a cello
        student, with a murky relationship with her family and her love. The
        three set out on a journey that will take them to confront their fears
        and frustrations and to make each a decision that will change their
        lives.</image:caption
